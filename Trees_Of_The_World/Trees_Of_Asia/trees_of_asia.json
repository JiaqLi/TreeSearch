ISBN 978-0-486-43499-5.</ref>\n\nIn March 1521, an extremely detailed description of the coconut was given by [[Antonio Pigafetta]] writing in Italian and using the words \"cocho\"/\"cochi\", as recorded in his journal after the first European crossing of the Pacific Ocean during the [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] [[circumnavigation]] and meeting the inhabitants of what would become known as [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]].  He explained how at Guam \"they eat coconuts\" (\"mangiano cochi\") and that the natives there also \"anoint the body and the hair with cocoanut and beneseed oil\" (\"ongieno eL corpo et li capili co oleo de cocho et de giongioli\").<ref name=ap/>  The journal then details how on the following week, Magellan's expedition landed at [[Suluan]] east of [[Leyte Gulf]] in the Philippines.  There they were given gifts by the natives which included two coconuts (\"dui cochi\"), with indication that more coconuts would be brought later (\"cochi et molta altra victuuaglia\").<ref name=ap/> Pigafetta then goes into great detail on how coconut is used and processed by the Filipino natives:\n<blockquote>\nCocoanuts are the fruit of the palmtree. Just as we have bread, wine, oil, and milk, so those people get everything from that tree. They get wine in the following manner. They bore a hole into the heart of the said palm at the top called palmito [i.e., stalk], from which distils a liquor which resembles white must. That liquor is sweet but somewhat tart, and [is gathered] in canes [of bamboo] as thick as the leg and thicker. They fasten the bamboo to the tree at evening for the morning, and in the morning for the evening. That palm bears a fruit, namely, the cocoanut, which is as large as the head or thereabouts. Its outside husk is green and thicker than two fingers. Certain filaments are found in that husk, whence is made cord for binding together their boats. Under that husk there is a hard shell, much thicker than the shell of the walnut, which they burn and make therefrom a powder that is useful to them. Under that shell there is a white marrowy substance one finger in thickness, which they eat fresh with meat and fish as we do bread; and it has a taste resembling the almond. It could be dried and made into bread. There is a clear, sweet water in the middle of that marrowy substance which is very refreshing. When that water stands for a while after having been collected, it congeals and becomes like an apple. When the natives wish to make oil, they take that cocoanut, and allow the marrowy substance and the water to putrefy. Then they boil it and it becomes oil like butter. When they wish to make vinegar, they allow only the water to putrefy, and then place it in the sun, and a vinegar results like [that made from] white wine.<ref name=\"ap\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=283tAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA100&dq=cocho&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=on | title=Magellan's Voyage Around the World, Volume 1 | publisher=Arthur H. Clark Company | author=Antonio Pigafetta; translated by James Alexander Robertson  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=1906 | pages=64\u2013100}}</ref>\n\nFrom the said fruit milk can also be made, as we proved by experience.  For we scraped that marrow, then mixed it with its own water, and being passed through a cloth it became like goat's milk.  This kind of palm tree is like the palm that bears dates, but not so knotty.  And of these trees will sustain a family of ten persons.  But they do not draw the aforesaid wine always from one tree, but take it for a week from one, and so with the other, for otherwise the trees would dry up.  And in this way they last one hundred years.<ref name=ap/>\n</blockquote>\n\nIt is evident that the name 'coco' and 'coconut' came from these 1521 encounters with Pacific islanders, and not from the other regions where it was found as no name is similar in any of the languages of India, where the Portuguese first found the fruit; and indeed [[Duarte Barbosa|Barbosa]], Barros, and Garcia, in mentioning the Tamil/Malayalam name ''tenga'', and [[Canarese]] ''narle'', expressly say, \"we call these fruits ''quoquos''\", \"our people have given it the name of coco\", and \"that which we call coco, and the Malabars ''temga''\".\n\nOther stories to explain the origin of the word have been published.  The [[OED]] states: \"Portuguese and Spanish authors of the 16th c. agree in identifying the word with Portuguese and Spanish ''coco'' \"grinning face, grin, grimace\", also \"bugbear, scarecrow\", cognate with ''cocar'' \"to grin, make a grimace\"; the name being said to refer to the face-like appearance of the base of the shell, with its three holes. According to Losada, the name came from [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] explorers, the sailors of [[Vasco da Gama]] in India, who first brought them to Europe. The coconut shell reminded them of a [[ghost]] or [[witch]] in Portuguese folklore called ''[[Cuco|coco]]'' (also ''c\u00f4ca'').<ref>Losada, Fernando D\u00edez. (2004). ''La tribuna del idioma''.

Human cultivation of the coconut selected, not for larger size, but for thinner husks and increased volume of endosperm, the solid \u201cmeat\u201d or liquid \u201cwater\u201d that provides the fruit its food value. Although these modifications for domestication would reduce the fruit\u2019s ability to float, this ability would be irrelevant to a cultivated population.\n\nAmong modern ''C. nucifera'', two major types or variants occur: a thick-husked, angular fruit and a thin-husked, spherical fruit with a higher proportion of endosperm reflect a trend of cultivation in ''C. nucifera''. The first coconuts were of the ''niu kafa'' type, with thick husks to protect the seed, an angular, highly ridged shape to promote buoyancy during ocean dispersal, and a pointed base that allowed fruits to dig into the sand, preventing them from being washed away during germination on a new island. As early human communities began to harvest coconuts for eating and planting, they (perhaps unintentionally) selected for a larger endosperm to husk ratio and a broader, spherical base, which rendered the fruit useful as a cup or bowl, thus creating the ''niu vai'' type. The decreased buoyancy and increased fragility of this spherical, thin-husked fruit would not matter for a species that had started to be dispersed by humans and grown in plantations. Harries\u2019 adoption of the Polynesian terms ''niu kafa'' and ''niu vai'' has now passed into general scientific discourse, and his hypothesis is generally accepted.<ref name=Lebrun>{{cite journal | last1 = Lebrun | first1 = P. | last2 = Seguin | first2 = M. | last3 = Grivet | first3 = L. | last4 = Baudouin | first4 = L. | year = 1998 | title = Genetic diversity in coconut (''Cocos nucifera'' L.) revealed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers | url = | journal = Euphytica | volume = 101 | issue = | pages = 103\u2013108 }}</ref><ref name=Shukla>{{cite journal | last1 = Shukla | first1 = A. | last2 = Mehrotra | first2 = R.

And no coconut can float over the sea faster than a balsa raft moves with the wind behind it.\"<ref name=Heyerdahl /></blockquote> He also notes that several of the nuts began to germinate by the time they had been ten weeks at sea, precluding an unassisted journey of 100 days or more. However, the coconut variety Heyerdahl chose for his long sea voyage likely was of the large, fleshy, spherical ''niu vai'' type, which Harries observed to have a significantly shorter germination type and worse buoyancy than the uncultivated ''niu kafa'' type.<ref name=Harries /> Therefore, Heyerdahl\u2019s observations cannot be considered conclusive when it comes to determining the independent dispersal ability of the uncultivated coconut.\n\nDrift models based on wind and ocean currents have shown that coconuts could not have drifted across the Pacific unaided.<ref name=Ward />  If they were naturally distributed and had been in the Pacific for a thousand years or so, then we would expect the eastern shore of Australia, with its own islands sheltered by the Great Barrier Reef, to have been thick with coconut palms: the currents were directly into, and down along this coast.  However, both [[James Cook]] and [[William Bligh]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.sl.nsw.gov.au/archive/discover_collections/history_nation/terra_australis/logbook.html|title=William Bligh's Logbook|first=State Library of New South|last=Wales|publisher=|accessdate=October 26, 2016}}</ref> (put adrift after the Bounty Mutiny) found no sign of the nuts along this 2000&nbsp;km stretch when he needed water for his crew.   Nor were there coconuts on the east side of the African coast until [[Vasco de Gama]], nor in the Caribbean when first visited by [[Christopher Columbus]]. We know from early Spanish documents that they deliberately planted coconuts shortly after first contact,{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} and some nuts would certainly have self-seeded when they floated ashore following ship-wrecks. They were commonly carried by Spanish ships as a source of sweet water.\n\nThis provides substantial circumstantial evidence that deliberate voyagers were involved in carrying coconuts across the Pacific Ocean (possibly the [[Austronesian peoples]]) and that they could not have dispersed worldwide without human agency. More recently, genomic analysis of cultivated coconut (''C. nucifera'' L.) has shed light on the movement. By examining 10 microsatellite loci, researchers found two genetically distinct subpopulations of coconut\u2014one originating in the Indian Ocean, the other in the Pacific Ocean.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} However, [[Genetic admixture|admixture]], the transfer of genetic material, evidently occurred between the two populations.\n\nGiven that coconuts are ideally suited for inter-island group ocean dispersal, obviously some natural distribution did take place. However, this should not be extrapolated to claims that one ocean's sub-genera possibly could have floated to interbreed with the other.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} However, the locations of the admixture events are limited to [[Madagascar]] and coastal east Africa, and exclude the [[Seychelles]]. This pattern coincides with the known trade routes of Austronesian sailors. Additionally, a genetically distinct subpopulation of coconut on the Pacific coast of Latin America has undergone a genetic bottleneck resulting from a [[founder effect]];{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} however, its ancestral population is the Pacific coconut. This, together with their use of the South American [[sweet potato]], suggests that Austronesian peoples may have sailed as far east as the Americas.<ref name=\"coco\">{{cite journal|last=Gunn|first=Bee|author2=Luc Baudouin |author3=Kenneth M.

A coconut tree is also included in the country's national emblem and coat of arms. Coconut trees are grown on all the islands. Before modern construction methods were introduced, coconut leaves were used as roofing material for many houses in the islands, while [[coconut timber]] was used to build houses and boats.\n\n===Middle East===\nThe main coconut-producing area in the Middle East is the [[Dhofar]] region of [[Oman]], but they can be grown all along the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Arabian Sea]], and [[Red Sea]] coasts, because these seas are tropical and provide enough humidity (through seawater evaporation) for coconut trees to grow. The young coconut plants need to be nursed and irrigated with drip pipes until they are old enough (stem bulb development) to be irrigated with [[brackish water]] or seawater alone, after which they can be replanted on the beaches. In particular, the area around [[Salalah]] maintains large coconut plantations similar to those found across the Arabian Sea in Kerala. The reasons why coconut are cultivated only in [[Yemen]]'s [[Al Mahrah]] and [[Hadramaut]] governorates and in the Sultanate of Oman, but not in other suitable areas in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], may originate from the fact that Oman and Hadramaut had long [[dhow]] trade relations with [[Burma]], Malaysia, Indonesia, East Africa, and [[Zanzibar]], as well as southern India and China. Omani people needed the coir rope from the coconut fiber to stitch together their traditional high seas-going dhow vessels in which nails were never used. The 'know how' of coconut cultivation and necessary soil fixation and irrigation may have found its way into Omani, Hadrami and Al-Mahra culture by people who returned from those overseas areas.\n\n[[File:Al hafa corniche.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Coconut trees line the beaches and corniches of [[Oman]].]]\n\nThe coconut cultivars grown in Oman are generally of the drought-resistant Indian 'West Coast tall' <!-- (WC Tall) --> variety. Unlike the [[UAE]], which grows mostly non-native dwarf or hybrid coconut cultivars imported from Florida for ornamental purposes, the slender, tall Omani coconut cultivars are relatively well-adapted to the Middle East's hot dry seasons, but need longer to reach maturity. The Middle East's hot, dry climate favors the development of coconut mites, which cause immature seed dropping and may cause brownish-gray discoloration on the coconut's outer green fiber.\n\nThe ancient coconut groves of Dhofar were mentioned by the medieval Moroccan traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] in his writings, known as ''Al [[Rihla]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1354-ibnbattuta.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Ibn Battuta: Travels in Asia and Africa 1325\u20131354 |author=Halsall, Paul.

It is spread by host insects, that thrive on heavy turf grasses. Therefore, heavy turf grass environments ([[beach resort]]s and [[golf course]]s) also pose a major threat to local coconut trees. Traditionally, [[dessert banana]] plants and local wild beach flora such as ''[[Scaevola taccada]]'' and ''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae]]'' were used as humidity-supplying green undergrowth for coconut trees, mixed with [[sea almond]] and [[sea hibiscus]]. Due to growing [[sedentary lifestyle]]s and heavy-handed landscaping, a decline in these traditional farming and soil-fixing techniques has occurred.\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nAn early mention of the planting of coconuts is found in the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' during the reign of [[Aggabodhi II of Anuradhapura|Agrabodhi II]] around 589 AD.<ref name=Grimwood1/> Coconuts are common in the Sri Lankan diet and the main source of dietary fat.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Kaunitz | first1 = H. \n| title = Medium chain triglycerides (MCT) in aging and arteriosclerosis \n| journal = Journal of Environmental Pathology, Toxicology and Oncology : official organ of the International Society for Environmental Toxicology and Cancer \n| volume = 6 \n| issue = 3\u20134 \n| pages = 115\u2013121 \n| year = 1986 \n| pmid = 3519928\n}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Painted coconuts for Dia de Muertos.jpg|alt=A red woman's face with a fish on her head and a wolf painted onto coconut husks|thumb|Paintings on coconut shells for [[Day of the Dead]] in the United States]]\nIn the United States, coconut palms can be grown and reproduced outdoors without irrigation in [[Hawaii]],  southern and central [[Florida]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.floridagardener.com/palms/coconutpalm.htm | title=''Cocos nucifera'', Coconut palm | publisher=Florida Gardener | work=FloridaGardener.com | date=12 June 2008 | accessdate=27 July 2016}}</ref> and the territories of [[Puerto Rico]], [[Guam]], [[American Samoa]], the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], and the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]].\n\nIn Florida, coconut palms grow from coastal Pinellas County and [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]] southwards on Florida's west coast, and [[Melbourne, Florida|Melbourne]] southwards on Florida's east coast as well as inland south Florida.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The occasional coconut palm can also be found further inland of the coastal areas of central Florida in favored [[microclimate]]s in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and to a lesser extent [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].

In more recent years, the importation of coconuts was prohibited; therefore, a large proportion of the younger trees have been propagated from locally grown coconuts.\n\nIn the winter, the growth rate of coconut trees declines due to cooler temperatures and people have commonly attributed this to the reduced yield of coconuts in comparison to tropical regions. However, whilst cooler winter temperatures may be a factor in reducing fruit production, the primary reason for the reduced yield is a lack of water. Bermuda's soil is generally very shallow (1.5 to 3.0 feet) and much of a coconut tree's root mass is found in the porous limestone underneath the soil. Due to the porosity of the limestone, Bermuda's coconut trees do not generally have a sufficient supply of water with which they are able to support a large number of fruit as rain water quickly drains down through the limestone layer to the water table which is far too deep for a coconut's roots to reach. This typically leads to a reduction in fruit yield (sometimes as few as one or two mature fruits), as well as a reduced milk content inside the coconut that often causes the fruit to be infertile.\n\nConversely, trees growing in close proximity to the sea almost universally yield much more fruit, as they are able to tap directly into the sea water which permeates the limestone in such areas. Not only do these trees produce a significantly higher yield, but also the fruit itself tends to be far more fertile due to the higher milk content. Trees found growing in Bermuda's marshy inland areas enjoy a similar degree of success, as they are also able to tap directly into a constant supply of water.\n\n===Substitutes for cooler climates===\nIn cooler climates (but not less than [[Hardiness zone|USDA Zone 9]]), a similar palm, the [[queen palm]] (''Syagrus romanzoffiana''), is used in [[landscaping]]. Its fruits are similar to the coconut, but smaller. The queen palm was originally classified in the genus ''Cocos'' along with the coconut, but was later reclassified in ''[[Syagrus (plant)|Syagrus]]''. A recently discovered palm, ''[[Beccariophoenix alfredii]]'' from [[Madagascar]], is nearly identical to the coconut, more so than the queen palm and can also be grown in slightly cooler climates than the coconut palm. Coconuts can only be grown in temperatures above {{convert|18|C|F}} and need a daily temperature above {{convert|22|C|F}} to produce fruit.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Coastal drive along KK.jpg|thumb|right|Coconut trees are used for landscaping along a coastal road in [[Kota Kinabalu]], [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]].]]\n\nThe coconut palm is grown throughout the [[tropics]] for decoration, as well as for its many culinary and nonculinary uses; virtually every part of the coconut palm can be used by humans in some manner and has significant economic value. Coconuts' versatility is sometimes noted in its naming. In [[Sanskrit]], it is ''kalpa vriksha'' (\"the tree which provides all the necessities of life\"). In the [[Malay language]], it is ''pokok seribu guna'' (\"the tree of a thousand uses\"). In the Philippines, the coconut is commonly called the \"[[tree of life]]\".<ref>Margolis, Jason.

The seed provides oil for frying, cooking, and making [[margarine]]. The white, fleshy part of the seed, the coconut meat, is used fresh or dried in cooking, especially in confections and desserts such as [[macaroons]]. Desiccated coconut or coconut milk made from it is frequently added to [[curries]] and other savory dishes. Coconut flour has also been developed for use in baking, to combat malnutrition.<ref>Grimwood 1975, p.

Coconut butter is often used to describe solidified coconut oil, but has also been adopted as a name by certain specialty products made of coconut milk solids or  [[pur\u00e9e]]d coconut meat and oil. Dried coconut is also used as the filling for many [[chocolate bars]]. Some dried coconut is purely coconut, but others are manufactured with other ingredients, such as [[sugar]], [[propylene glycol]], [[salt]], and [[sodium metabisulfite]]. Some countries in Southeast Asia use special coconut mutant called [[Kopyor coconut]] (Kopyor in Indonesia) or macapuno (in the Philippines) as dessert drinks.\n\n{{Nutritional value\n| name=Coconut meat, raw\n| water=46.99 g\n| kcal=354\n| protein=3.33 g\n| fat=33.49 g\n| satfat=29.698 g\n| monofat = 1.425 g\n| polyfat = 0.366 g\n| ash=0.97 g\n| carbs=15.23 g\n| sugars=6.23 g\n| fiber=9.0 g\n| calcium_mg=14\n| copper_mg=0.435\n| iron_mg=2.43\n| magnesium_mg=32\n| phosphorus_mg=113\n| potassium_mg=356\n| sodium_mg=20\n| zinc_mg=1.10\n| manganese_mg=1.500\n| selenium_mg=10.1\n| vitC_mg=3.3\n| thiamin_mg=0.066\n| riboflavin_mg=0.020\n| niacin_mg=0.540\n| pantothenic_mg=0.300\n| vitB6_mg=0.054\n| folate_ug=26\n| choline_mg\n| vitE_mg=0.24\n| vitK_ug=0.2\n<!-- amino acids -->\n| tryptophan=0.039 g\n| threonine=0.121 g\n| isoleucine=0.131 g\n| leucine=0.247 g\n| lysine=0.147 g\n| methionine=0.062 g\n| cystine=0.066 g\n| phenylalanine=0.169 g\n| tyrosine=0.103 g\n| valine=0.202 g\n| arginine=0.546 g\n| histidine=0.077 g\n| alanine=0.170 g\n| aspartic acid=0.325 g\n| glutamic acid=0.761 g\n| glycine=0.158 g\n| proline=0.138 g\n| serine=0.172 g\n| right=1\n| source_usda=1\n| note=[http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?qlookup=12104&format=Full Link to USDA Database entry]\n}}\n\n===Nutrition===\nPer 100-gram serving with 354 [[calories]], raw coconut meat supplies a high amount of total [[fat]] (33 grams), especially [[saturated fat]] (89% of total fat) and [[carbohydrates]] (24 g) (table).

It can be reduced further to yield [[coconut sugar]] also referred to as [[palm sugar]] or [[jaggery]]. A young, well-maintained tree can produce around {{convert|300|l|abbr=on}} of toddy per year, while a 40-year-old tree may yield around {{convert|400|l|abbr=on}}.<ref>Grimwood 1975, p.

They are considered a rare delicacy, as harvesting the buds kills the palms. Hearts of palm are eaten in salads, sometimes called \"millionaire's salad\". Newly germinated coconuts contain an edible fluff of marshmallow-like consistency called coconut sprout, produced as the endosperm nourishes the developing embryo.\n\n===Indonesia===\nCoconut is an indispensable ingredient in Indonesian cooking. Coconut meat, coconut milk, and coconut water are often used in main courses, desserts, and soups throughout the archipelago. In the island of Sumatra, the famous ''[[rendang]]'', the traditional beef stew from West [[Sumatra]], chunks of beef are cooked in coconut milk along with other spices for hours until thickened. In [[Jakarta]], ''soto babat'' or [[Tripe#Beef tripe|beef tripe]] soup also uses coconut milk. In the island of [[Java]], the sweet and savoury ''tempe bacem'' is made by cooking ''[[tempeh]]'' with coconut water, [[coconut sugar]], and other spices until thickened. ''Klapertart'' is the famous Dutch-influenced dessert from Manado, North [[Celebes]], that uses young coconut meat and coconut milk.\nIn 2010, Indonesia increased its coconut production. It is now the world's largest producer of coconuts. The gross production was 15 million tonnes.<ref name=\"FAO\">[http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx#ancor FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION OF THE UNITED NATIONS], FAO</ref> A sprouting coconut seed is the logo for [[Gerakan Pramuka Indonesia]], the Indonesian scouting organization.

Coconuts in the Philippines are usually used in making main dishes, refreshments, and desserts. Coconut juice is also a popular drink in the country. In the Philippines, particularly Cebu, rice is wrapped in coconut leaves for cooking and subsequent storage; these packets are called ''[[ketupat|puso]]''. Coconut milk, known as ''gata'', and grated coconut flakes are used in the preparation of dishes such as ''[[Taro#(Philippines)|laing]]'', ''[[ginataan]]'', ''[[bibingka]]'', ''[[ube halaya]]'', ''[[pitsi-pits\u00ee]]'', ''[[palitaw]]'' and ''[[buko pie]]''.  [[Coconut jam]] is made by mixing [[muscovado]] with coconut milk. Coconut [[Sport (botany)|sport fruit]]s are also harvested. One such variety of coconut is known as ''macapuno''. Its meat is sweetened, cut into strands, and sold in glass jars as coconut strings, sometimes labeled as \"gelatinous mutant coconut\". Coconut water can be fermented to make a different product\u2014''[[nata de coco]]'' (coconut gel).\n\n===Vietnam===\nIn [[Vietnam]], coconut is grown abundantly across [[Central Vietnam|central]] and [[southern Vietnam]], and especially in [[B\u1ebfn Tre Province]], often called the \"land of the coconut\". It is used to make [[coconut candy]], [[caramel]], and jelly. Coconut juice and coconut milk are used, especially in Vietnam's southern style of cooking, including ''[[kho (cooking technique)|kho]]'', ''[[ch\u00e8]]'', and curry (''c\u00e0 ri'').\n\n===India===\nIn southern India, the most common way of cooking vegetables is to add grated coconut and then steam them with spices fried in oil. People from southern India also make [[chutney]], which involves grinding the coconut with salt, chillies, and whole spices. ''[[Uruttu Chammanthi|Uruttu chammanthi]]'' (granulated chutney) is eaten with rice or ''kanji'' (rice gruel). It is also invariably the main side dish served with ''[[idli]], [[vadai]]'', and ''[[dosai]]''. Coconut ground with spices is also mixed in ''[[Sambar (dish)|sambar]]'' and other various lunch dishes for extra taste. Dishes garnished with grated coconut are generally referred to as  ''[[poduthol]]'' in [[North Malabar]] and ''thoran'' in rest of Kerala.  ''[[Puttu]]'' is a culinary delicacy of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, in which layers of coconut alternate with layers of powdered rice, all of which fit into a bamboo stalk. Recently, this has been replaced with a steel or aluminium tube, which is then steamed over a pot. Coconut ({{Lang-ta|\u0ba4\u0bc7\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0baf\u0bcd}}) is regularly broken in the middle-class families in Tamil Nadu for food. Coconut meat can be eaten as a snack sweetened with jaggery or [[molasses]]. In Karnataka, sweets are prepared using coconut and dry coconut copra, such as ''kaie obattu, kobri mitai,'' etc.\n\n===Commercial, industrial, and household use===\n[[File:Coconuts drying before being processed into copra, Polomuhu village, Central Province, Solomon Islands 2004.

They can be sorted mainly into tall cultivars, dwarf cultivars, and hybrid cultivars (hybrids between talls and dwarfs). Some of the dwarf cultivars such as 'Malayan dwarf' have shown some promising resistance to lethal yellowing, while other cultivars such as 'Jamaican tall' are highly affected by the same plant disease. Some cultivars are more drought resistant such as 'West coast tall' (India) while others such as 'Hainan Tall' (China) are more cold tolerant. Other aspects such as seed size, shape and weight, and copra thickness are also important factors in the selection of new cultivars. Some cultivars such as 'Fiji dwarf' form a large bulb at the lower stem and others are cultivated to produce very sweet coconut water with orange-coloured husks ([[king coconut]]) used entirely in fruit stalls for drinking (Sri Lanka, India).\n\n====Coir====\n[[File:Coconut wall.jpg|thumb|A wall made from coconut husks]]\n[[File:srilanka coconut fibre.jpg|thumb|upright|Extracting the fiber from the husk (Sri Lanka)]]\n\n[[Coir]] (the fiber from the husk of the coconut) is used in ropes, mats, door mats, brushes, and sacks, as caulking for boats, and as stuffing fiber for [[mattress]]es.<ref>Grimwood 1975, p.

The green of the leaves (lamina) are stripped away, leaving the veins (wood-like, thin, long strips) which are tied together to form a broom or brush. A long handle made from some other wood may be inserted into the base of the bundle and used as a two-handed broom. The leaves also provide material for baskets that can draw well water and for roofing thatch; they can be woven into mats, cooking skewers, and kindling arrows, as well. Two leaves (especially the younger, yellowish shoots) woven into a tight shell the size of the palm are filled with rice and cooked to make ''ketupat''.<ref>Grimwood 1975, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fY5hLeJ-WW4C&pg=PA18#v=onepage&q&f=false 19].</ref> Dried coconut leaves can be burned to ash, which can be harvested for [[lime (mineral)|lime]]. In India, the woven coconut leaves are used as ''pandals'' (temporary sheds) for marriage functions especially in the states of Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.\n\n====Copra====\n{{Main article|Copra|Coconut oil}}\nCopra is the dried meat of the seed and after processing produces coconut oil and coconut meal. Coconut oil, aside from being used in cooking as an ingredient and for frying, is used in soaps, cosmetics, hair-oil, and massage oil. Coconut oil is also a main ingredient in [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic oils]]. In Vanuatu, coconut palms for copra production are generally spaced 9 m apart, allowing a tree density of 100\u2013160 trees per hectare.\n\n====Husks and shells====\nThe husk and shells can be used for fuel and are a source of [[charcoal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Coconut Shell Lump Charcoal|url=http://www.supremecarbon.com/coco.htm|publisher=Supreme Carbon Indonesia}}</ref> Activated carbon manufactured from coconut shell is considered extremely effective for the removal of impurities.

It is known as a ''bunot'' in the Philippines and simply a \"coconut brush\" in [[Jamaica]]. The fresh husk of a brown coconut may serve as a dish sponge or body sponge. A ''[[coco chocolatero]]'' was a cup used to serve small quantities of beverages (such as chocolate drinks) between the 17th  and  19th centuries in countries such as Mexico, Guatemala, and Venezuela.\n\n[[File:Coconut button factory in Dongjiao - 02.JPG|thumbnail|Coconut buttons in Dongjiao Town, [[Hainan]], China]]\nIn Asia, coconut shells are also used as bowls and in the manufacture of various handicrafts, including buttons carved from dried shell. Coconut buttons are often used for Hawaiian [[aloha shirt]]s. ''Tempurung'', as the shell is called in the Malay language, can be used as a soup bowl and\u2014if fixed with a handle\u2014a ladle. In Thailand, the coconut husk is used as a potting medium to produce healthy forest tree saplings. The process of husk extraction from the coir bypasses the retting process, using a custom-built coconut husk extractor designed by [[ASEAN]]\u2013Canada Forest Tree Seed Centre <!-- (ACFTSC) --> in 1986. Fresh husks contains more [[tannin]] than old husks. Tannin produces negative effects on sapling growth.<ref>Somyos Kijkar. \"Handbook: Coconut husk as a potting medium\".

It has applications in furniture and specialized construction, as notably demonstrated in Manila's [[Coconut Palace]].\n\nHawaiians hollowed the trunk to form drums, containers, or small canoes. The \"branches\" (leaf [[petiole (botany)|petiole]]s) are strong and flexible enough to make a [[switch (rod)|switch]]. The use of coconut branches in corporal punishment was revived in the Gilbertese community on Choiseul in the [[Solomon Islands]] in 2005.<ref>Herming, George. (March 6, 2006).

The coconut shell may also be ground down and added to products for [[exfoliation (cosmetology)|exfoliation]] of dead skin. Coconut is also a source of [[lauric acid]], which can be processed in a particular way to produce [[sodium lauryl sulfate]], a detergent used in shower gels and shampoos.<ref>[http://www.ongnaturalbodycare.co.uk/news/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/coconuts-their-many-uses-in-beauty-products ongnaturalbodycare.co.uk. (April 1, 2012) ]</ref> The nature of lauric acid as a fatty acid makes it particularly effective for creating detergents and [[surfactant]]s.\n\n===Religion===\n{{see also|Coconut Religion}}\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}\nIn the [[Ilocos region]] of northern Philippines, the [[Ilocano people]] fill two halved coconut shells with ''diket'' (cooked sweet rice), and place ''liningta nga itlog'' (halved boiled egg) on top of it. This ritual, known as ''niniyogan'', is an offering made to the deceased and one's ancestors. This accompanies the ''palagip'' (prayer to the dead).\n\nA coconut ({{lang-sa|''nalikera''}}) is an essential element of [[rituals]] in [[Hindu]] tradition. Often it is decorated with bright metal foils and other symbols of auspiciousness. It is offered during worship to a Hindu god or goddess. [[Narali Purnima]] is celebrated on a full moon day which usually signifies the end of monsoon season in India. The word \u2018Narali\u2019 is derived from \u2018Naral\u2019 implying \u2018coconut\u2019 in [[Marathi people|Marathi]]. Fishermen give an offering of coconut to the sea to celebrate the beginning of a new fishing season.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.maharashtratourism.net/festivals/narali-poornima.html | title=Narali Purnima | publisher=Maharashtra Tourism | date=2016 | accessdate=3 August 2016}}</ref> Irrespective of their religious affiliations, fishermen of India often offer it to the rivers and seas in the hopes of having bountiful catches. Hindus often initiate the beginning of any new activity by breaking a coconut to ensure the blessings of the gods and successful completion of the activity. The Hindu goddess of well-being and wealth,  [[Lakshmi]], is often shown holding a coconut.<ref>Dallapiccola, Anna. ''[[Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend]]''. ISBN 0-500-51088-1.</ref> In the foothills of the temple town of  [[Palani]], before going to worship [[Murugan]] for the [[Ganesha]], coconuts are broken at a place marked for the purpose. Every day, thousands of coconuts are broken, and some devotees break as many as 108 coconuts at a time as per the prayer. In  [[tantra|tantric]] practices, coconuts are sometimes used as substitutes for human skulls.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nIn [[Hindu wedding]] ceremonies, a coconut is placed over the opening of a pot, representing a [[womb]]. Coconut flowers are auspicious symbols and are fixtures at [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] weddings and other important occasions. In Kerala, coconut flowers must be present during a marriage ceremony. The flowers are inserted into a barrel of unhusked rice (paddy) and placed within sight of the wedding ceremony. Similarly in [[Sri Lanka]], coconut flowers, standing in brass urns, are placed in prominent positions.\n\nThe [[Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club]] of [[New Orleans]] traditionally throws hand-decorated coconuts, the most valuable of Mardi Gras souvenirs, to parade revelers. The \"Tramps\" began the tradition ''circa'' 1901. In 1987, a \"coconut law\" was signed by [[Edwin Edwards|Gov. Edwards]] exempting from insurance liability any decorated coconut \"handed\" from a Zulu float.\n\nThe coconut is also used as a target and prize in the traditional British fairground game \"coconut shy\". The player buys some small balls which he throws as hard as he can at coconuts balanced on sticks. The aim is to knock a coconut off the stand and win it.\n\nIt was the main food of adherents of the now discontinued Vietnamese religion [[Coconut Religion|\u0110\u1ea1o D\u1eeba]] in [[B\u1ebfn Tre]].\n\n====Myths and legends====\nSome South Asian, Southeast Asian, and Pacific Ocean cultures have [[origin myth]]s in which the coconut plays the main role.

It is very tolerant of difficult growing conditions in [[urban area|urban]] situations, which has increased its popularity in civic planting schemes in recent decades. Turkish hazel makes a wonderful shade tree since\nit produces very dense shade, and its narrow crown and ability to withstand air-pollution make it well suited for use as a street tree in urban areas. It makes a rather formal statement in the landscape due to the tight, consistently-shaped, narrow crown. It is well suited for areas which have restricted overhead. <ref> {{cite web|first=Edward and Dennis|last=Gilman and Watson|title= ''Corylus colurna'' Fact Sheet| publisher=University of Florida |year=1993 |url=http://hort.ifas.ufl.edu/database/documents/pdf/tree_fact_sheets/corcola.pdf}}</ref> ''Corylus colurna'' is also used in different sized parking lot islands and a variety of wide lawns.

In the [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], it is commonly grown for its leaves which are used as food. Moringa is also actively cultivated by the [[World Vegetable Center]] in [[Taiwan]], a center for vegetable research. In [[Haiti]], it is grown as [[windbreak]]s and to help reduce [[soil erosion]].\n\nMore generally, moringa grows in the wild or is cultivated in [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]], northern countries of [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Southeast Asia]] and various countries of [[Oceania]].\n\nAs of 2010, cultivation in [[Hawaii]], for commercial distribution in the [[United States]], is in its early stages.<ref name=\"ted\">{{cite journal\n | title=Farm and Forestry Production and Marketing Profile for Moringa (revised February 2011)\n | author=Ted Radovich\n | year=2011\n | journal=In: Specialty Crops for Pacific Island Agroforestry\n | editor=C.R Elevitch\n | publisher=Permanent Agriculture Resources\n | location=Holualoa, Hawai'i\n | url=http://agroforestry.net/scps/Moringa_specialty_crop.pdf\n}}</ref>\n\n===Cultivation practice===\n====Soil preparations====\nIn tropical cultivation, [[soil erosion]] is a major problem. Therefore, the soil treatment has to be as shallow as possible. Plowing is required only for high planting densities. In low planting densities, \"it is better to dig pits and refill them with the soil. This ensures good root system penetration without causing too much land erosion. The pits must be 30 to 50 cm deep, and 20 to 40 cm wide.\"\n\n====Propagation====\nMoringa can be [[plant propagation|propagated]] from [[seed]] or [[cutting (plant)|cuttings]]. \nDirect seeding is possible because the [[germination rate]] of ''M. oleifera'' is high. Moringa seeds can be germinated year-round in well-draining soil. Cuttings of 1 m length and at least 4&nbsp;cm diameter can be used for [[vegetative propagation]].\n\n====Planting====\nFor intensive leaf production, \"the spacing of plants should be 15 x 15 cm or 20 x 10 cm, with conveniently spaced alleys (for example: every 4 m) to facilitate plantation management and harvests.\"<ref name=\"amaglo\"/> [[Weeding]] and [[disease prevention]] are difficult because of the high density.  In a semi-intensive production, the plants are spaced 50&nbsp;cm to 1 m apart. This gives good results with less maintenance.\n\nMoringa trees can also be cultivated in alleys, as natural fences and associated with other crops. The distance between Moringa rows in an agroforestry cultivation is usually between 2 and 4 meters.\n\n==Breeding==\nIn India, from where moringa most likely originated, the diversity of wild types is large. This gives a good basis for breeding programs. In countries where moringa has been introduced, the diversity is usually much smaller among the cultivar types. Locally well-adapted wild types, though, can be found in most regions.\n\nBecause moringa is cultivated and used in different ways, there are different breeding aims. The breeding aims for an annual or a perennial plant are obviously different. The yield stability of fruits is an important breeding aim for the commercial cultivation in India, where moringa is cultivated as an annual. On less favorable locations, perennial cultivation has big advantages. Erosion is much smaller with perennial cultivation. In [[Pakistan]], varieties have been tested for their nutritional composition of the leaves on different locations.<ref name=Rees3>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jfca.2005.05.001 |title=Effect of season and production location on antioxidant activity of Moringa oleifera leaves grown in Pakistan |year=2006 |last1=Iqbal |first1=Shahid |last2=Bhanger |first2=M.I. |journal=Journal of Food Composition and Analysis |volume=19 |issue=6\u20137 |pages=544\u2013551}}</ref> \nThe different breeding aims result in a different selection. India selects for a higher number of pods and dwarf or semidwarf varieties. Breeders in Tanzania, though, are selecting for higher oil content.\n\n==Yield and harvest==\n''M. oleifera'' can be cultivated for its leaves, pods, and/or its kernels for oil extraction and water purification. The yields vary widely, depending on season, variety, fertilization, and irrigation regimen. Moringa yields best under warm, dry conditions with some supplemental fertilizer and irrigation.<ref name=ted/> Harvest is done manually with knives, sickles, and stabs with hooks attached.<ref name=ted/> [[Pollarding]], [[coppicing]] and lopping or [[pruning]] are recommended to promote branching, increase production and facilitate harvesting.<ref name=\"pollarding\">{{cite book |last=Grubben |first1=G |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=6jrlyOPfr24C&lpg=PA394&ots=DqyftRKuYZ&dq=pollarding%20moringa&pg=PA394#v=onepage&q=pollarding%20moringa&f=false |title=Vegetables |volume=2 |edition=Plant resources of tropical Africa |editor-last=Grubben |editor-first= G.

It may be preserved by [[canning]] but is often made into a variety of curry dishes by mixing with coconut, poppy seeds, and mustard or boiled until the drumsticks are semisoft and consumed directly without any extra processing or cooking. It is used in [[curry|curries]], ''[[Sambar (dish)|sambar]]s'', ''[[korma]]s'', and ''[[dal]]s'', although it is also used to add flavor to [[cutlet]]s and other recipes.\n\nThe fruit meat of drumsticks, including young seeds, is used for soup. Young leaves can either be fried with shrimp or added as a topping in fish soup. Several traditional dishes use leaves (''sluc'') of the moringa tree known as ''daum m'rum'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ediblyasian.info/recipes/cambodian-common-culinary-herbs-and-spices-|title=Cambodian common culinary herbs and spices|publisher=}}</ref> such as ''korko'' (a mixed vegetable soup). As it is a favorite vegetable, Cambodians traditionally grow moringa trees close to their residences.\n\nTender drumstick leaves, finely chopped, are used as garnish for vegetable dishes and salads. It is also used in place of or along with [[coriander]]. In some regions, the flowers are gathered and cleansed to be cooked with [[Gram flour|''besan'']] to make ''[[pakora]]s''.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe leaves may be fried and mixed with dried-fried tuna chips, onions and dried [[chillies]]. This is equivalent to a ''sambal'' and eaten along with rice and curry. Soup is made with the leaves and rice, and eaten especially for breakfast during [[Ramadan]]. It is also a common ingredient in an [[omelet]]. The pods are used to cook a mild curry.\n[[File:Kaeng som-marum63.JPG|thumb|left|Traditional Thai ''[[kaeng som]]'' with drumstick pods and fresh ''[[pla thu]]'']]\n \nFlowers may be first separated from the stem, boiled, mashed, and cooked.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Other regions of Indian cuisine often uses moringa seed pods and leaves in curries. The long moringa seed pods are cut into shorter lengths and stewed in curries and soups. Because they are fibrous, seed pods are often chewed to extract the juices and nutrients, with the remaining fibrous material discarded. The flowers are mixed with gram flour and other spices, then deep fried into [[fritter]]s to be served as snacks or added to curries.\n\nThe green pods, leaves, and flowers are used in a variety of [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] dishes, such as curries, stir-fries, soups, omelets, and salads.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} A traditional dish is sour [[Thai curry]] made with drumstick pods and fish.\n\nMoringa leaves are commonly added to broth as a simple soup. The leaves may also be used as a typical ingredient in ''[[tinola]]'', a traditional chicken dish consisting of chicken in a broth, moringa leaves, and either green [[papaya]] or another vegetable or in the all vegetable dish known as ''[[utan]]''. The leaves can also be processed with olive oil and salt for a [[pesto]]-like pasta sauce. Moringa juice may be mixed with ''[[Calamondin|lemonsito]]'' juice to make ice candies or cold drinks. In Indonesia, the leaves are commonly eaten in a clear vegetable soup, often with corn, spinach and coconut milk.\n\n==Traditional medicine and research==\nThe bark, sap, roots, leaves, seeds and flowers are used in [[traditional medicine]].<ref name=leone/><ref>{{cite book\n | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k2BDAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA66&dq=moringa+flowers+edible&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEMQ6AEwA2oVChMInoGDv-HkxgIVyhc-Ch2yzwUw#v=onepage&q=moringa%20flowers%20edible&f=false\n | title=Handbook on Agro Based Industries (2nd Revised Edition)\n | author=NPCS Board\n | year=2012\n | publisher=Niir Project Consultancy Services\n | isbn=9381039127\n | page=66\n}}\n</ref> Research has examined how it might affect blood [[lipid profile]]s, although it is not effective at diagnosing, treating, or preventing any human diseases.<ref name=mskcc>{{cite web |url=https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/moringa-oleifera |title=Moringa oleifera |publisher=[[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]] |accessdate=2014-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n | journal=Acta Medica Philippina\n | url=http://actamedicaphilippina.com.ph/sites/default/files/fulltexts/vol-47-no-3-effect.pdf\n | title=Effect of Malunggay (Moringa oleifera) Capsules on Lipid and Glucose Levels\n | volume=47\n | issue=3\n | year=2013\n | author1=Sandoval, Mark Anthony S.\n | author2=Jimeno, Cecilia A.\n | pages=22\u201327\n}}</ref>\n\nExtracts from leaves contain low contents of [[polyphenols]] which are under [[basic research]] for their potential properties.<ref name=leone/><ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://www.ijens.org/Vol_13_I_03/131201-1303-7474-IJBAS-IJENS.pdf|title = Nutrient Composition and Sensory Evaluation of Dry Moringa Oleifera Aqueous Extract|last = Madukwe|first = E.U.|date = June 2013|journal = International Journal of Basic & Applied Sciences IJBAS-IJENS|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = Antioxidant Activity and Total Phenolic Content of Moringa oleifera Leaves in Two Stages of Maturity|url = http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11130-009-0141-0|journal = Plant Foods for Human Nutrition|date = 2009-11-11|issn = 0921-9668|pages = 303\u2013311|volume = 64|issue = 4|doi = 10.1007/s11130-009-0141-0|first = S.|last = Sreelatha|first2 = P.

It has a [[cone (geometry)|conical]] crown with level branches and usually pendulous branchlets.\n\nThe shoots are pale buff-brown, and glabrous (hairless). The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, the longest of any spruce, 3\u20135&nbsp;cm long, rhombic in cross-section, mid-green with inconspicuous [[stomata]]l lines. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are broad cylindric-conic, 9\u201316&nbsp;cm long and 3&nbsp;cm broad, green when young, maturing buff-brown and opening to 5\u20136&nbsp;cm broad 5\u20137 months after pollination; the scales are stiff and smoothly rounded.\n\nMorinda spruce is a popular ornamental tree in large [[garden]]s in western [[Europe]] for its attractive pendulous branchlets. It is also grown to a small extent in [[forestry]] for [[timber]] and [[paper]] production, though its slower growth compared to [[Norway spruce]] reduces its importance outside of its native range. The name ''morinda'' derives from the tree's name in [[Nepali language|Nepali]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{IUCN2006|assessor=Conifer Specialist Group|year=1998|id=42338|title=Picea smithiana|downloaded=6 May 2006}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*[http://www.conifers.org/pi/Picea_smithiana.php Gymnosperm Database]\n\n[[Category:Picea|smithiana]]\n[[Category:Trees of Asia|Picea smithiana]]\n[[Category:Trees of Afghanistan|Picea smithiana]]\n[[Category:Trees of India|Picea smithiana]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nepal|Picea smithiana]]\n[[Category:Trees of Pakistan|Picea smithiana]]\n[[Category:Least concern plants|Picea smithiana]]",

Other names include '''blue pine''',<ref name=GRIN/> '''Himalayan pine'''<ref name=GRIN/> and '''Himalayan white pine'''.<ref name=GRIN/> In the past, it was also known by the invalid botanic names ''Pinus griffithii'' McClelland or \"''Pinus excelsa''\" [[Nathaniel Wallich|Wall.]], ''Pinus chylla'' [[Loddiges|Lodd.]] when the tree became available through the European nursery trade in 1836, nine years after Nathaniel Wallich first introduced seeds to England.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] (\"needles\") are in fascicles (bundles) of five and are 12\u201318&nbsp;cm long. They are noted for being flexible along their length, and often droop gracefully. The cones are long and slender, 16\u201332&nbsp;cm, yellow-buff when mature, with thin scales; the seeds are 5\u20136&nbsp;mm long with a 20\u201330&nbsp;mm wing.\n\nTypical habitats are mountain screes and glacier forelands, but it will also form [[old-growth forest]]s as the primary species or in mixed forests with [[Cedrus deodara|deodar]], [[birch]], [[spruce]], and [[fir]]. In some places it reaches the [[tree line]].\n\n==Uses==\nThe [[wood]] is moderately hard, durable and highly resinous. It is a good firewood but gives off a pungent resinous smoke. It is a commercial source of [[turpentine]] which is superior quality than that of ''[[Pinus roxburghii|P. roxburghii]]'' but is not produced so freely.\n\nIt is also a popular tree for planting in [[park]]s and large [[garden]]s, grown for its attractive foliage and large, decorative cones. It is also valued for its relatively high resistance to [[air pollution]], tolerating this better than some other conifers.\n\nThis plant has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=6300 | title=Pinus wallichiana AGM | publisher=Royal Horticultural Society | accessdate=July 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Bhutan pine foliage.JPG|Foliage\nFile:Pinus wallichiana at VanDusen Botanical Garden.jpg|Cones, at [[VanDusen Botanical Garden]]\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.conifers.org/pi/Pinus_wallichiana.php Gymnosperm Database: ''Pinus wallichiana'']\n* [http://www.pinetum.org/cones/PNStrobus.htm Photo of cones (scroll half-way down)]\n* [http://www.ibiblio.org/pfaf/cgi-bin/arr_html?Pinus+wallichiana&CAN=COMIND Plants for a future]\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Pinus|wallichiana]]\n[[Category:Trees of Afghanistan]]\n[[Category:Trees of Bhutan]]\n[[Category:Trees of Myanmar]]\n[[Category:Trees of China]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nepal]]\n[[Category:Trees of Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Flora of Tibet]]\n[[Category:Flora of West Himalaya]]\n[[Category:Flora of East Himalaya]]\n[[Category:Gymnosperms of China]]\n[[Category:Trees of temperate climates]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1938]]",

The species has a variety of uses in traditional medicine. It is currently classified as [[endangered species|endangered]] by the [[IUCN]].\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe Himalayan yew is found in China ([[Yunnan]] and [[Sichuan]]), Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan, India (Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Assam), Myanmar, and some parts of Viet Nam. It is also present in the Philippines, Sulawesi and Sumatra. The species favours a reasonably wide range of habitats, growing in montane, temperate, warm temperate, and tropical submontane to high montane forests which may be deciduous, evergreen, or of mixed character. In forests, it tends to present as a low canopy tree; in open situations it usually forms a large, broadly spreading shrub. Elevation ranges from 900 m to 3,700 m.<ref name=iucn/>\n\n==Growth==\nIt is a medium-sized [[evergreen]] [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] [[tree]] growing to 20 m tall, similar to ''[[Taxus baccata]]'' and sometimes treated as a [[subspecies]] of it. The shoots are green at first, becoming brown after three or four years. The [[leaf|leaves]] are thin, flat, slightly [[leaf shape|falcate]] ([[sickle]]-shaped), 1.5\u20132.7&nbsp;cm long and 2&nbsp;mm broad, with a softly mucronate apex; they are arranged spirally on the shoots but twisted at the base to appear in two horizontal ranks on all except for erect lead shoots. It is [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], with the male and female [[conifer cone|cones]] on separate plants; the seed cone is highly modified, [[Berry (botany)|berry]]-like, with a single scale developing into a soft, juicy red [[aril]] 1&nbsp;cm diameter, containing a single dark brown [[seed]] 7&nbsp;mm long. The [[pollen]] cones are globose, 4&nbsp;mm diameter, produced on the undersides of the shoots in early spring.<ref name=rushforthc/>\n\n==Species==\nSimilar plants occurring further east through China to [[Taiwan]], [[Vietnam]] and the [[Philippines]] are included in ''Taxus wallichiana'' as ''T. wallichiana'' var.

Declines have been particularly heavy in India and Nepal,  with losses of up to 90% having been reported. The degree of exploitation in other locations in its range is less well known, but is also assumed to be serious. The species is currently classified as [[endangered species|endangered]] by the [[IUCN]].

It grows in areas of scanty rainfall (annual 150-500mm) and high temperature (35&nbsp;\u00b0C to 48&nbsp;\u00b0C). It can withstand extreme low temperature (0&nbsp;\u00b0C to &minus;2&nbsp;\u00b0C) during winter and high temperature (48&nbsp;\u00b0C to 50&nbsp;\u00b0C) in summers. The tree is a strong light demander. It is drought, frost, fire and wind hardy. At the time of flowering (December\u2013February) it produces beautiful showy flowers in yellow, orange and red colours. Three types of flower bearing trees can be observed near to each other in the same vicinity.\n\n==Distribution==\nDistribution of ''Tecomella undulata'' is restricted to the drier parts of the [[Arabia]], southern [[Pakistan]] and northwest [[India]] up to an elevation of 1200 metres. In [[Pakistan]] in [[Attock kala chita mountain]] where its local name is [[Haroora|\u06c1\u0631\u0648\u0691\u0627]] it is found in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Baluchistan]] and [[Sindh]]. In [[India]], it occurs naturally in [[Maharashtra]], [[Gujarat]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Haryana]].\n\nThe species is mainly found to occur in western parts of [[Rajasthan]]. In other states its population is scanty and very rare. In Rajasthan, ''Tecomella undulata'' is found in [[Barmer, Rajasthan|Barmer]], [[Jaisalmer]], [[Jodhpur]], [[Pali, Rajasthan|Pali]], [[Ajmer]], [[Nagaur]], [[Bikaner]], [[Churu]] and [[Sikar]] districts.\n\n''Tecomella undulata'' is an accepted tree species in [[agroforestry]] and large population is found in [[agricultural]] lands. It can be observed growing in [[community]] land, forestland and orans in association with ''Prosopis cineraria'', ''Capparis decidua'', ''Maytenus emarginata'', ''Zizyphus spp''. And ''Salvadora spp''. In agriculture land it generally grows in association with ''[[Prosopis cineraria]]''.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Stem of Tecomella.jpg|left|thumb|Stem of ''Tecomella undulata'' tree at the village of [[Gharsana]], [[India]]]]''Tecomella undulata'' is mainly used as a source of timber. Its wood is strong, tough and durable. It takes a fine finish. Heartwood contains quinoid. The wood is excellent for firewood and charcoal. Cattle and goats eat leaves of the tree. Camels, goats and sheep consume flowers and pods.\n\n''Tecomella undulata'' plays an important role in [[ecology]]. It acts as a soil-binding tree by spreading a network of lateral roots on the top surface of the soil. It acts as a windbreak and helps in stabilizing shifting [[sand dunes]]. It is considered as the home of birds and provides shelter for other [[desert]] [[wildlife]].  Shade of [[tree crown]] is shelter for the cattle, goats and gsheep during summer days.\n\n''Tecomella undulata'' has got medicinal properties as well. The bark obtained from the stem is used as a remedy for [[syphilis]]. It is also used in curing [[urinary]] disorders, enlargement of [[spleen]], [[gonorrhoea]], [[leucoderma]] and [[liver]] diseases. Seeds are used against [[abscess]]. Traditionally in Musakhel, Pakistan its flower used for Hepatitis.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n* [[Arid Forest Research Institute]] (AFRI)\n\n==References==\n*ROHIDA (''Tecomella undulata''), Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education, Dehradun\n*[http://www.patrika.com/news.aspx?id=225617 Conservation status Patrika News in Hindi]\n* Yahy M.

The tree soon proved eminently unsuited to the cold [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] winters and died, but not before a five-budded cutting could be sent to [[Simeon Gottfried Albert Doorenbos|S. G. A. Doorenbos]], Parks Director at [[The Hague]], in 1929. Doorenbos was able to graft four of the buds, and the following year had a row of strongly growing plants.
