On the other hand, they are more open and have a greater concentration of [[hardwood]]s than the forests of the [[Piney Woods]].<ref name=\"WWF\"/> The climate is hot and humid.<ref name=\"WildWorld\">{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=na0405|name=East Central Texas forests|accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref>\n\n==Subregions==\n\n===Northern Post Oak Savanna===\nThe landscapes of this ecoregion are generally more level and gently rolling compared to the more dissected and irregular topography of much of Southern Post Oak Savanna. It is underlain by mostly [[Eocene]] and [[Paleocene]]-age formations with some [[Cretaceous]] rocks to the north. The deciduous forest or woodland is composed mostly of [[post oak]], [[blackjack oak]], [[eastern redcedar]], and [[black hickory]]. Prairie openings contained [[little bluestem]] and other grasses and forbs. The land cover currently has more improved pasture and less post oak woods and forest than the Southern Post Oak Savanna. Some coniferous trees occur, especially on the transitional boundary with the Tertiary Uplands ecoregion. [[Loblolly pine]] has been planted in several areas. Typical wildlife species include [[white-tailed deer]], [[eastern wild turkey]], [[northern bobwhite]], [[eastern fox squirrel]], and [[eastern gray squirrel]].<ref name=TexasPosterBack>{{USGS|url=ftp://ftp.epa.gov/wed/ecoregions/tx/tx_back.pdf|article=Ecoregions of Texas poster, back|accessdate=2016-02-06}}</ref>\n\n===Southern Post Oak Savanna===\nThis ecoregion has more woods and forest than the adjacent prairie ecoregions, and consists of mostly hardwoods compared to the pines to the east in the South Central Plains. Historically a post oak [[savanna]], current land cover is a mix of [[post oak]] woods, improved pasture, and rangeland, with some invasive mesquite to the south. A thick understory of [[yaupon]] and [[eastern redcedar]] occurs in some parts. The ecoregion is underlain by [[Miocene]], [[Oligocene]], [[Eocene]], and [[Paleocene]] sediments. Sand exposures within these Tertiary deposits have a distinctive sandyland flora, and in a few areas unique bogs occur. The endangered [[Houston Toad]] is associated with the deep sandy soils of this ecoregion<ref name=TexasPosterBack/>\n\n===San Antonio Prairie===\nThis ecoregion is a narrow, 100-mile long region occurring primarily on the [[Eocene]] [[Cook Mountain Formation]].  Upland Alfisol prairies were dominated by [[little bluestem]] and [[Sorghastrum nutans|yellow indiangrass]] and contained a different mix of grasses and forbs than the dark, clayey, more calcareous soils of the Northern [[Texas blackland prairies]]. Since the 1830s, settlement clustered along the Old San Antonio Road ([[Texas State Highway 21]] in the south, [[Old San Antonio Road]] in the north) within this narrow belt of prairie land. Currently, land cover is a mosaic of woodland, improved pasture, rangeland, and some cropland.<ref name=TexasPosterBack/>\n\n===Northern Prairie Outliers===\nThe small, disjunct areas of this ecoregion have a blend of characteristics from the [[Texas blackland prairies]] and the East Central Texas forests. The northern two outliers, north of the [[Sulphur River]], occur on [[Cretaceous]] sediments, while south of the river, [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]] formations predominate. A mosaic of forest and prairie occurred historically in this and adjacent regions. [[Wildfire|Burning]] was important in maintaining grassy openings, and woody invasions have taken place in the absence of fire. The tallgrass prairies included [[little bluestem]], [[big bluestem]], [[Sorghastrum nutans|yellow indiangrass]], and [[tall dropseed]]. Current land cover is mostly pasture, with some cropland.<ref name=TexasPosterBack/>\n\n===Bastrop Lost Pines===\n[[File:Endangered Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis)1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Houston Toad]] is an endangered species endemic to the East Central Texas forests.]]\nThis ecoregion is an outlier of relict [[loblolly pine]]-[[post oak]] upland forest occurring on some dissected hills. It is the westernmost tract of southern pine in the United States. The pines mostly occur on gravelly soils that formed in [[Pleistocene]] high gravel, [[fluvial]] terrace deposits associated with the ancestral [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]], and sandy soils that formed in [[Eocene]] [[sandstones]] (such as the [[Weches Formation]]). The Lost Pines are about {{convert|100|mi|km}} west of the Texas pine belt of the South Central Plains and occur in a drier environment with {{convert|36|in|mm}} of average annual precipitation. In this area, the deep, acidic, sandy soils and the additional moisture provided by the Colorado River contribute to the occurrence of pines, which are thought to be a relict population predating the last glacial period. The largest population of the [[Houston Toad]] occurs in this ecoregion<ref name=TexasPosterBack/>\n\n===Floodplains and Low Terraces===\nThis ecoregion contains floodplain and low terrace deposits downstream from the [[Texas blackland prairies]] and upstream from the Texas coastal plains. It includes only the wider floodplains of major streams, such as the [[Sulphur River|Sulphur]], [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity]], [[Brazos River|Brazos]], and [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado]] rivers. In addition, it covers primarily [[Holocene]] deposits and not [[Pleistocene]] deposits on older, high terraces. The bottomland forests contain [[water oak]], [[post oak]], [[elm]]s, [[green ash]], [[pecan]], [[willow oak]] to the east, and to the west some [[Celtis|hackberry]] and [[eastern cottonwood]]s. The northern floodplains tend to have more forested land cover, while in the south the Brazos and Colorado River floodplains are characterized by more cropland and pasture.<ref name=TexasPosterBack/>\n\n==Fauna==\nThe forests are home to a rich wildlife including [[Virginia opossum]]s (''Didelphis virginiana''), [[North American least shrew]]s (''Cryptotis parva''), [[North American beaver]]s (''Castor canadensis'') and many species of butterflies and reptiles. Larger mammals that once lived here, including [[jaguar]] (''Panthera onca'') and [[Plains bison]] (''Bison bison bison''), have now disappeared from the region.<ref name=\"WWF\"/> Endangered fauna found in this ecoregion include the [[Houston toad]] (''Bufo houstonensis'') and [[Attwater's prairie chicken]]s (''Tympanuchus cupido attwateri'').<ref name=\"WildWorld\"/>\n\n==Conservation==\nThis environment has been heavily altered by cattle ranching and clearance for farmland with only a quarter of the original habitats remaining, in fragmented patches and not in large blocks. There are no national forests in the region.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Texas forests]]\n* [[List of ecoregions in the United States (WWF)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the United States]]\n[[Category:Ecoregions of the United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of Texas| ]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States| ]]",

The leaf arrangement is spiral on the shoot, but with each leaf variably twisted at the base so they all lie in either two more-or-less flat ranks on either side of the shoot, or upswept across the top of the shoot but not below the shoot.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|cones]] are {{convert|6|\u2013|12|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4|\u2013|4.5|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} broad, green or purple ripening pale brown, with about 100\u2013150 scales; the scale bracts are short, and hidden in the closed cone. The winged [[seed]]s are released when the cones disintegrate at maturity about 6 months after pollination.<ref>{{eFloras|1|233500005|Abies concolor}}</ref>\n\n=== Subspecies ===\n[[Image:Abies concolor cones.jpg|thumb|left|Foliage and cones of subsp. ''concolor'']]\nAs treated here, there are two [[subspecies]]; these are also variously treated at either the lower rank of [[variety (biology)|variety]] by some authors, or as distinct [[species]] by others:\n\n====''Abies concolor'' subsp. ''concolor''====\n* '''''Abies concolor'' subsp. ''concolor''''' \u2014 '''Colorado white fir''' or '''Rocky Mountains white fir'''. In the [[United States]], at altitudes of {{convert|1700|\u2013|3400|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[Rocky Mountains]] from southern [[Idaho]], south through [[Utah]] and [[Colorado]], to [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]], and on the higher [[Great Basin]] mountains of [[Nevada]] and extreme southeastern [[California]], and a short distance into northern [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]]. A smaller tree to {{convert|25|\u2013|35|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall, rarely {{convert|45|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}}. Foliage strongly upcurved to erect on all except weak shaded shoots in the lower crown; leaves mostly {{convert|3.5|\u2013|6|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}}, and strongly glaucous on the upper side with numerous stomata. Tolerates winter [[temperature]]s down to about {{convert|-40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.\n\n====''Abies concolor'' subsp. ''lowiana''====\n* '''''Abies concolor'' subsp. ''lowiana''''' ([[syn.]] ''Abies lowiana'') \u2014 '''Low's white fir''' or '''Sierra Nevada white fir'''. In the [[United States]], at altitudes of {{convert|900|\u2013|2700|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] of central [[Oregon]] south through [[California]] ([[Klamath Mountains]], [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]) to northern [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]]. A larger tree to {{convert|40|\u2013|60|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall. Foliage flattened on lower crown shoots, the leaves often raised above the shoot on upper crown shoots but not often strongly upcurved; leaves mostly {{convert|2.5|\u2013|5|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}}, and only weakly glaucous on the upper side with few or no stomata. Tolerates winter temperatures down to about {{convert|-30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Related species===\nWhite fir is very closely related to [[grand fir]] (''Abies grandis''), with subspecies ''lowiana'' being particularly similar to the interior variety of grand fir ''A. grandis'' var. ''idahoensis'', intergrading with it where they meet in the Cascades of central Oregon. To the south in Mexico, it is replaced by further close relatives, [[Durango fir]] (''A. durangensis'') and [[Mexican fir]] (''A. mexicana'').\n...\n\n==Forest succession==\nWhite fir, being shade tolerant, is a [[climax species]] in forest succession in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and in the presence of modern human controls against forest fires, it has flourished over the past two centuries. It is sometimes regarded as a pest by those in the lumber industry, as it drives out trees of greater stature (such as the [[sugar pine]] and [[incense cedar]]), has weaker, knottier wood than its competitors, and retains its lower limbs. This latter trait creates a fire ladder that allows flames to reach up to the canopy, thinning out [[giant sequoia]] stands that would escape smaller forest fires with minimal damage.<ref>[http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/science/hartesveldt/chap6.htm The Giant Sequoia of the Sierra Nevada] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022031750/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/science/hartesveldt/chap6.htm |date=October 22, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n== Discovery ==\nThis tree was discovered by [[William Lobb]] on his expedition to California of 1849\u20131853, having been overlooked previously by [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]].<ref>{{cite book | author= Toby Musgrave | author2= Chris Gardner | author3= Will Musgrave | last-author-amp= yes | title=The Plant Hunters| publisher=[[Orion Publishing Group|Seven Dials]] | year=1999|page=147| isbn=1-84188-001-9}}</ref><ref>Hildebrand, Friedrich Hermann Gustav.

The [[bark]] is dark brown to gray, with narrow fissures and flat ridges creating plate-like scales; it is thin and easily damaged. The [[leaf|leaves]] are opposite, simple, 6\u201312&nbsp;cm long and broad, with three to five deep, bluntly-pointed lobes, three of the lobes large and two small ones (not always present) at the leaf base; the three major lobes each have 3\u20135 small subsidiary lobules. The leaves turn golden yellow to red in fall (this trait is less reliable in warmer areas).\n\nThe [[flower]]s appear with the leaves in mid spring; they are produced in [[corymb]]s of 5\u201315 together, each flower yellow-green, about 4\u20135&nbsp;mm diameter, with no petals. The [[fruit]] is a paired samara (two winged [[seed]]s joined at the base), green to reddish-pink in color, maturing brown in early fall; each seed is globose, 7\u201310&nbsp;mm diameter, with a single wing 2\u20133&nbsp;cm long.\n\n[[Image:Red leaves (Acer grandidentatum) - Little Cottonwood Canyon, Utah (2003).jpg|left|180px]]\nIt commonly grows in [[limestone]] soils but can adapt to a wide range of well-drained soils, from sand to clays to even white limestone areas. It prefers sheltered canyons, valleys, and the banks of mountain streams, primarily at higher elevations but occasionally at lower elevations in disjunct locales such as the southern edge of the [[Edwards Plateau]] in [[Texas]] and in the [[Wichita Mountains]] of [[southwestern Oklahoma]]. Although [[continental climate]]s prevail over all of its natural range, it grows well in the [[maritime climate]] of [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]]. It is slow growing when young, and does not have many pests.\n\nIt is occasionally planted as an ornamental tree, valued for its drought tolerance and ability to grow in rocky landscapes.\n\nOther vernacular names occasionally used include lost maple, Sabinal maple, western sugar maple, Uvalde big tooth maple, canyon maple, southwestern big tooth maple, plateau big tooth maple, limerock maple, Wasatch maple and Rocky Mountain sugar maple.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lost Maples State Natural Area]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{commons|Acer grandidentatum}}\n\n[[Category:Acer|grandidentatum]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Rocky Mountains]]",

In [[Canada]] it is commonly known as [[Manitoba]] maple and occasionally as elf maple. '''Box elder''', '''boxelder maple''', '''ash-leaved maple''', and '''maple ash''' are its most common names in the [[United States]]; in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] it is also known as '''ashleaf maple'''.<ref name=BSBI07>{{cite web|title=BSBI List 2007 |publisher=Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland |url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |format=xls |access-date=2014-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VqJ46atN?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bsbi.org.uk%2FBSBIList2007.xls |archivedate=2015-01-25 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Common names ==\n\nIndicative of its familiarity to many people over a large geographic range, ''A. negundo'' has numerous common names.\n\nThe names \"box elder\" and \"boxelder maple\" are based upon the similarity of its whitish wood to that of [[Buxus|boxwood]] and the similarity of its [[pinnate]]ly compound leaves to those of some species of [[Sambucus|elder]].<ref>[http://www.depauw.edu/univ/naturepark/natural_history/trees/aceraceae/acer_negundo.htm DePauw University]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>   This is the only North American maple with compound leaves, though several Asian species also have them.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book | last=Keeler | first=H. L. | title=Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them | publisher=Charles Scriber's Sons | year=1900 | location=New York | pages=85\u201387 }}</ref>\n\nOther common names are based upon this maple's similarity to [[Fraxinus|ash]], its preferred environment, its [[maple syrup|sugary sap]], a description of its leaves, its [[binomial name]], and so on.  These names include (but are not limited to) ash-, cut-, or three-leaf (or -leaved) maple; ash maple; sugar ash; Negundo maple; and river maple.<ref>[http://www.windsorplywood.com/ Acer spp. Aceraceae] Note that some of the common names given in this reference are questionable.  \"stinking ash\" and \"black ash\" typically refer to ''[[Ptelea trifoliata]]'' and ''[[Fraxinus nigra]]'', respectively.  This reference is retained as an example of the confusion which arises when plants such as ''A. negundo'' are discussed by other than their [[scientific name]]s.</ref>  In [[Canada]] it is commonly known as Manitoba maple and occasionally as elf maple.<ref>[http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/index/commtreesprairies/manitobamaple Community trees of the Prairie provinces&nbsp;\u2013 Canadian Forest Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  In [[Russia]] it is called American maple ({{lang-rus|\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0451\u043d|amerikansky klyon}})<!-- [[Wikipedia:Romanization of Russian]] --> as well as ash-leaf maple ({{lang-rus|\u043a\u043b\u0451\u043d \u044f\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0301\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439|klyon yasenelistny}}), and in Italian ''acero americano''.<ref>[http://luirig.altervista.org/flora/taxa/index2.php?scientific-name=acer+negundo Altervista Italiana, Acero americano, ''Acer negundo'' L.]</ref>\n\nCommon names may also designate a particular [[subspecies]].  For example, a common name for ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''interius'' may be preceded by \"inland\" (as in \"inland boxelder maple\").  A common name for ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''californicum'' may be preceded by \"California\" or \"western\".\n\n[[File:2014-10-11 12 48 07 Box Elder Maple foliage during autumn in Elko, Nevada.JPG|thumb|left|Autumn leaf color]]\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Acer negundo bark-Clapiers~2010 04 05.jpg|thumb|left|Bark of a young ''Acer negundo''.]]\n''Acer negundo'' is a usually fast-growing and fairly short-lived [[tree]] that grows up to {{convert|10|-|25|m|ft|round=5|sp=us}} tall, with a trunk diameter of {{convert|30|-|50|cm|in|0|sp=us}}, rarely up to {{convert|1|m|ft|sp=us}} diameter.  It often has several trunks and can form impenetrable thickets.<ref name=\"gelderen\">van Gelderen, C.J. & van Gelderen, D.M. (1999). ''Maples for Gardens: A Color Encyclopedia''.</ref>\n\nThe shoots are green, often with a whitish to pink or violet [[wax]]y coating when young.  Branches are smooth, somewhat brittle, and tend to retain a fresh green colour rather than forming a [[bark]] of dead, protective tissue.  The bark on its trunks is pale gray or light brown, deeply cleft into broad ridges, and scaly.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nUnlike most other maples (which usually have [[simple leaf|simple]], [[palmate]]ly [[lobed leaf|lobed]] [[leaf|leaves]]), ''Acer negundo'' has [[pinnate]]ly [[compound leaf|compound]] leaves that usually have three to seven leaflets.  Simple leaves are also occasionally present;  technically, these are single-leaflet compound leaves.  Although some other maples (such as ''[[Acer griseum]]'', ''[[Acer mandshuricum]]'' and the closely related [[Acer cissifolium|''A. cissifolium'']]) have [[leaf shape|trifoliate]] leaves, only ''A. negundo'' regularly displays more than three leaflets.\n\nThe leaflets are about {{convert|5|-|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}} long and {{convert|3|-|7|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} wide with slightly serrate margins.  Leaves have a [[translucence|translucent]] light green color and turn yellow in the [[Autumn|fall]].\n\nThe [[flower]]s are small and appear in early spring on drooping [[raceme]]s {{convert|10|-|20|cm|in|0|sp=us}} long.  The [[fruit]]s are paired [[Samara (fruit)|samaras]], each seed slender, {{convert|1|-|2|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long, with a {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} incurved wing; they drop in autumn or they may persist through winter.  Seeds are usually both prolific and [[fertility|fertile]].\n\nUnlike most other maples, ''A. negundo'' is fully [[dioecious]] and both a male and female tree are needed for either to reproduce.\n\n* Winter buds: Terminal buds acute, an eighth of an inch long.  Lateral buds obtuse.  The inner scales enlarge when spring growth begins and often become an inch long before they fall.\n* Flowers: April, before the leaves, yellow green; staminate flowers in clusters on slender hairy pedicels one and a half to two inches long.  Pistillate flowers in narrow drooping racemes.\n* Calyx: Yellow green; staminate flowers campanulate, five-lobed, hairy.  Pistillate flowers smaller, five-parted; disk rudimentary.\n* Corolla: Wanting.\n* Stamens: Four to six, exserted; filaments slender, hairy; anthers linear, connective pointed.\n* Pistil: Ovary hairy, borne on disk, partly enclosed by calyx, two-celled, wing-margined.  Styles separate at base into two stigmatic lobes.\n* Fruit: Maple keys, full size in early summer.  Borne in drooping racemes, pedicels one to two inches long.  Key an inch and a half to two inches long, nutlets diverging, wings straight or incurved.  September.  Seed half an inch long.  Cotyledons, thin, narrow.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\n=== Subspecies ===\n[[File:Acer negundo.jpg|thumb|right|''A. negundo'' leaves and fruits]]\n\n''Acer negundo'' is often discussed as comprising three subspecies, each of which was originally described as a separate species.  These are:\n\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''negundo'' is the main variety and the type to which characteristics described in the article most universally apply.  Its natural range is from the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] to the Rocky Mountains.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''interius'' has more leaf serration than the main species and a more [[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]] leaf surface.  As the name ''interus'' indicates, its natural range of [[Saskatchewan]] to [[New Mexico]] is sandwiched between that of the other two subspecies.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''californicum'' has larger leaves than the main species.  Leaves also have a velvety texture which is essential to distinguish it from ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''negundo''.  It is found in parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]].<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n\nSome authors further subdivide subsp. ''negundo'' into a number of regional varieties but these intergrade and their maintenance as distinct [[taxa]] is disputed by many.  Even the differences between recognized subspecies are probably a matter of gradient [[speciation]].\n\nFinally, note that a few botanists treat boxelder maple as its own distinct genus (''Negundo aceroides'') but this is not widely accepted.\n\n== Distribution ==\nAs noted, varieties thrive across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It may also be found as far south as [[Guatemala]].\n\nAlthough native to [[North America]], it is considered an [[invasive species]] in some areas of that continent. It can quickly [[colonize]] both cultivated and uncultivated areas and the range is therefore expanding both in North America and elsewhere. In Europe where it was introduced in 1688 as a park tree it is able to spread quickly in places and is considered an invasive species in parts of Central Europe (Germany and the Czech Republic, middle Danube, Vistula river valley in Poland) where it can form mass growth in lowlands, disturbed areas and riparian biomes on calcareous soils. It has also become [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] in eastern [[China]]<ref name=\"gelderen\" />  and can be found in some of the cooler areas of the [[Australian continent]] where it is listed as a pest [[invasive species]].\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Acer negundo tree.jpg|thumb|Boxelder, Manitoba Maple. Tree. ND, USA.]]\n\nThis species prefers bright sunlight. It often grows on flood plains and other disturbed areas with ample water supply, such as [[riparian]] habitats. Human influence has greatly favoured this species; it grows around houses and in hedges, as well as on disturbed ground and vacant lots.\n\nSeveral [[bird]]s and some [[squirrel]]s feed on the seeds.  The [[evening grosbeak]] uses them extensively. The [[Maple Bug]] (also known as the Boxelder Bug) lays its [[egg]]s on all maples, but prefers this species.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nAlthough its weak wood, irregular form, and prolific seeding might make it seem like a poor choice for a landscape tree, ''A. negundo'' is one of the most common maples in cultivation and many interesting [[cultivar]]s have been developed, including:<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* 'Auratum'&nbsp;\u2013 yellowish leaves with smooth undersides\n* 'Aureomarginatum'&nbsp;\u2013 creamy yellow leaf margins\n* 'Baron'&nbsp;\u2013 Hardier & seedless variety\n* 'Elegans'&nbsp;\u2013 distinctively convex leaves\n* 'Flamingo'&nbsp;\u2013 pink and white [[variegation]] (very popular)\n* [[Acer negundo 'Pendulum'|'Pendulum']]&nbsp;\u2013 with weeping branches.\n* 'Variegatum'&nbsp;\u2013 creamy white leaf margins\n* 'Violaceum'&nbsp;\u2013 younger shoots and branches have bluish colour\n\n== Uses ==\nAlthough its light, close-grained, soft wood is considered undesirable for most uses, this tree has been considered as a commercial source of wood fiber, for use in [[fiberboard]].\n\nThere is some commercial use of the tree for various decorative applications, such as turned items (bowls, stem-ware, pens). Primarily burl wood and injured wood, where the primary reason is this wood's reaction to injury, where the injured wood develops a red stain.\n\n=== Use by Native Americans ===\nThe [[Navajo people|Navajo]] use the wood to make tubes for bellows.<ref>Elmore, Francis H. 1944 Ethnobotany of the Navajo.

The U.S. Forest service recognizes it as the most abundant native tree in eastern North America.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nix|first=Steve|title=Ten Most Common Trees in the United States|url=http://forestry.about.com/b/2012/07/21/ten-most-common-trees-in-the-united-states.htm|publisher=About.com Forestry|accessdate=8 October 2016}}</ref> The red maple ranges from southeastern [[Manitoba]] around the [[Lake of the Woods]] on the border with [[Ontario]] and [[Minnesota]], east to [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], south to [[Florida]], and southwest to eastern [[Texas]]. Many of its features, especially its leaves, are quite variable in form. At maturity it often attains a height of around {{convert|15|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}. Its flowers, petioles, twigs and seeds are all red to varying degrees. Among these features, however, it is best known for its brilliant deep scarlet foliage in autumn.\n\nOver most of its range, red maple is adaptable to a very wide range of site conditions, perhaps more so than any other tree in eastern North America. It can be found growing in [[swamp]]s, on poor dry [[soil]]s, and most anywhere in between. It grows well from [[sea level]] to about {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Due to its attractive fall foliage and pleasing form, it is often used as a shade tree for landscapes. It is used commercially on a small scale for [[maple syrup]] production as well as for its medium to high quality lumber. It is also the [[List of U.S. state trees|State Tree of Rhode Island]]. The red maple can be considered weedy or invasive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plants Profile for Acer rubrum|url=http://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=ACRU|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref> It is taking over forests in the eastern US, replacing traditional mainstays like oaks, as well as hickories and pines.<ref>{{cite web | title=Eastern Forests Change Color As Red Maples Proliferate | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/27/science/eastern-forests-change-color-as-red-maples-proliferate.html | publisher=New York Times | access-date=30 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Redmaplefoliage.jpg|thumb|Typical fall foliage in red maple country.]]\nThough ''A. rubrum'' is usually easy to identify, it is highly changeable in morphological characteristics.

As the tree grows the bark becomes darker and cracks into slightly raised long plates.<ref name=\"Mitchell\" /> The largest known living red maple is located near [[Armada, Michigan]], at a height of {{convert|38.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a bole circumference, at breast height, of {{convert|4.95|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\n[[File:Acer rubrum.jpg|thumb|Red Maple leaf from specimen in northern Florida]]\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] of the red maple offer the easiest way to distinguish it from its relatives. As with nearly all North American maple trees, they are [[deciduous]] and arranged oppositely on the twig. They are typically {{convert|5|\u2013|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long and wide with 3-5 [[palmate lobe]]s with a serrated margin. The [[sinus (botany)|sinuses]] are typically narrow, but the leaves can exhibit considerable variation.<ref name=\"VT\" /> When 5 lobes are present, the three at the terminal end are larger than the other two near the base. In contrast, the leaves of the related [[silver maple]], ''A. saccharinum'', are much more deeply lobed, more sharply toothed and characteristically have 5 lobes. The upper side of ''A. rubrum'''s leaf is light green and the underside is whitish and can be either [[glaucous]] or hairy. The leaf stalks are usually red and are up to {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long. Furthermore, the leaves can turn a brilliant red in autumn, but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals.\n\n[[File:2013-05-10 13 40 17 Immature foliage of Red Maple in Brendan T Byrne State Forest, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Immature foliage of Acer rubrum (Red Maple)]]\nThe [[twig]]s of the red maple are reddish in color and somewhat shiny with small [[lenticel]]s. Dwarf shoots are present on many branches. The [[bud]]s are usually blunt and greenish to reddish in color, generally with several loose scales. The lateral buds are slightly stalked, and in addition there may be collateral buds present as well. The buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their reddish tint. The leaf scars on the twig are V-shaped and contain 3 bundle scars.<ref name=\"VT\" />\n\n[[File:Acer rubrum drummondii drawing.png|right|thumb|Drawing showing male and female flower, leaf and samara]]\nThe [[flower]]s are generally unisexual, with male and female flowers appearing in separate [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]] clusters, though they are sometimes also bisexual. They appear in spring from April to May (though as early as late January in the southern part of its range), usually coming before the leaves. The tree itself is considered Polygamodioecious, meaning some individuals are male, some female, and some [[monoecious]].<ref name=\"USDF\" /> Under the proper conditions, the tree can sometimes switch from male to female, male to hermaphroditic, and hermaphroditic to female<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Primack|first=R.B.|last2=McCall|first2=C.|year=1986|title=Gender Variation in Red Maple Populations (Acer rubrum; Aceraceae): A Seven-Year Study of a \"Polygamodioecious\" Species.|url=|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=73 |issue=9|pages=1239\u20131248|via=}}</ref>  The red maple will begin blooming when it is about 8 years old, but it significantly varies between tree to tree: some trees may begin flowering when they are 4 years old.

After they reach maturity, the seeds are dispersed for a 1 to 2 week period from April through July.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n''A. rubrum'' is one of the most abundant and widespread trees in eastern [[North America]]. It can be found from the south of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Nova Scotia]] and southern [[Quebec]] to the south west of Ontario, extreme southeastern [[Manitoba]] and northern [[Minnesota]]; south to [[Wisconsin]], [[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], eastern [[Oklahoma]], and eastern [[Texas]] in its western range; and east to [[Florida]]. It has the largest continuous range along the North American [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] of any tree that occurs in Florida. In total it ranges {{convert|2600|km|mi|abbr=on}} from north to south.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> The species is native to all regions of the United States east of the [[95th meridian west|95th meridian]]. The tree's range ends where the {{convert|-40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} mean minimum [[isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]] begins, namely in southeastern [[Canada]]. ''A. rubrum'' is not present in the Prairie Peninsula of the northern [[Midwest]], the [[Western Gulf coastal grasslands|coastal prairie]] in southern [[Louisiana]] and southeastern Texas and the swamp prairie of the [[Florida Everglades]].<ref name=\"USDF\" /> The absence of red maple in the Prairie Peninsula is perhaps due to the specie's intolerance of fire.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/Volume_2/acer/rubrum.htm|title=Acer rubrum L.|last=Walters|first=Russell S|last2=Yawney|first2=Harry W.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn several other locations, the tree is absent from large areas but still present in a few specific habitats. An example is the [[Bluegrass region]] of Kentucky, where red maple is not found in the dominant open plains, but is present along streams.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Campbell| first=J| title=The Land of Cane and Clover| page=25| publisher=University of Kentucky| year=1985| postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the [[Grain Belt]], despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Linnaeus Acer rubrum.jpg|thumb|right|The type specimen of ''A. rubrum'' used by [[Carl Linnaeus]] when naming the species]] -->''A. rubrum'' does very well in a wide range of soil types, with varying textures, moisture, [[pH]], and elevation, probably more so than any other forest tree in North America. ''A. rubrum''<nowiki/>'s high pH tolerance means that it can grow in a variety of places, and it  is widespread along the eastern United States<nowiki/>.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=18(2), 177\u2013184.|first=Jared|last2=McCarthy|first2=Brian|year=2011|title=Diminished Soil Quality in an Old-Growth, Mixed Mesophytic Forest Following Chronic Acid Deposition Diminished Soil Quality in an Old-growth , Mixed Mesophytic Forest Following Chronic Acid Deposition|url=|journal=Northeast Naturalist|volume=18 |issue=2|pages=177\u2013184|via=}}</ref> It grows on glaciated as well as unglaciated soils derived from the following rocks: [[granite]], [[gneiss]], [[schist]], [[sandstone]], [[shale]], [[slate]], [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], [[quartzite]], and [[limestone]]. [[Chlorosis]] can occur on very [[alkaline]] soils, though otherwise its pH tolerance is quite high. Moist mineral soil is best for germination of seeds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe red maple can grow in a variety of moist and dry biomes, from dry ridges and sunny, southwest-facing slopes to [[peat bog]]s and [[swamp]]s. While many types of tree prefer a south or north facing aspect, the red maple does not appear to have a preference.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> Its ideal conditions are in moderately well-drained, moist sites at low or intermediate elevations. However, it is nonetheless common in mountainous areas on relatively dry ridges, as well as on both the south and west sides of upper slopes. Furthermore, it is common in swampy areas, along the banks of slow moving streams, as well as on poorly drained flats and depressions. In northern [[Michigan]] and [[New England]], the tree is found on the tops of ridges, sandy or rocky upland and otherwise dry soils, as well as in nearly pure stands on moist soils and the edges of swamps. In the far south of its range, it is almost exclusively associated with swamps.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> Additionally, Red maple is one of the most drought-tolerant species of maple in the Carolinas.<ref name=\"Miller\">Miller, J.H., & Miller, K.V. (1999). ''Forest plants of the southeast and their wildlife uses''. Champaign, IL: Kings Time Printing.</ref>\n\nRed maple is far more abundant today than when Europeans first arrived in North America, where along with its cousin Silver Maple, it may have comprised a mere 5% of forest area and was confined mostly to [[riparian zone]]s.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> The density of the tree in many of these areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing, much of it due to human factors, especially suppression of wildfires which would kill shallow-rooted pioneer species like red maple, but leave mainline forest trees like oaks and hickories untouched.\n\nAdditionally, conservation efforts of the red maple have caused a major increase in the population of [[white-tailed deer]] since the mid-20th century. Deer will readily consume acorns, but leave maple seeds untouched, thus reducing the ability of oaks to regenerate compared to maples.<ref name=\"Perdue\" />  Because it can grow on a variety of substrates, has a high pH tolerance, and grows in both shade and sun, ''A. rubrum'' can be called a \"super-generalist,\" and it is predicted to replace historically dominant tree species in the eastern United States such as  [[oak]]s, [[hickory]]s and [[pine]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abrams|first=M.D.|year=1998|title=The Red Maple Paradox: what explains the widespread expansion of red maple in eastern forests?|url=|journal=BioScience|volume=48 |issue=5|pages=355\u2013364|via=}}</ref> Extensive use of red maple in landscaping has also contributed to the surge in the species' numbers as volunteer seedlings proliferate.

Its ability to thrive in a large number of habitats is largely due to its ability to produce [[root]]s to suit its site from a young age. In wet locations, red maple seedlings produce short [[taproot]]s with long and developed lateral roots, while on dry sites, they develop long taproots with significantly shorter laterals. The roots are primarily horizontal, however, forming in the upper {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} of the ground. Mature trees have woody roots up to {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. They are very tolerant of flooding, with one study showing that 60 days of flooding caused no leaf damage. At the same time, they are tolerant of drought due to their ability to stop growing under dry conditions by then producing a second growth flush when conditions later improve, even if growth has stopped for 2 weeks.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\n[[File:Maplekeys.jpg|left|thumb|Samaras from a specimen in [[Milford, New Hampshire]]]]\n''A. rubrum'' is one of the first plants to flower in spring. A crop of seeds is generally produced every year with a bumper crop often occurring every second year. A single tree between {{convert|5|and|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter can produce between 12,000 and 91,000 seeds in a season. A tree {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter was shown to produce nearly a million seeds.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> Red maple produces one of the smallest seeds of any of the maples.<ref name=\"Miller\" />  Fertilization has also been shown to significantly increase the seed yield for up to two years after application. The seeds are [[epigeal germination|epigeal]] and tend to germinate in early summer soon after they are released, assuming a small amount of light, moisture, and sufficient temperatures are present. If the seeds are densely shaded, then germination commonly does not occur until the next spring. Most seedlings do not survive in closed [[canopy (biology)|forest canopy]] situations. However, one- to four-year-old seedlings are common under dense canopy and though they eventually die if no light reaches them, they serve as a reservoir, waiting to fill any open area of the canopy above. Trees growing in a Zone 9 or 10 area such as Florida will usually die from cold damage if transferred up north, Canada, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, even if the southern trees were planted with northern red maples. Due to their wide range, genetically the trees have adapted to the climatic differences.\n\n[[File:2015-04-13 10 38 10 Female Red Maple flowers on Madison Avenue in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Female flowers]]\nRed maple is able to increase its numbers significantly when associate trees are damaged by disease, cutting, or fire. One study found that 6 years after [[clearcutting]] a {{convert|3.4|ha|acre|abbr=off}} Oak-Hickory forest containing no red maples, the plot contained more than 2,200 red maple seedlings per hectare (900 per acre) taller than {{convert|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> One of its associates, the [[black cherry]] (''[[Prunus serotina]]''), contains benzoic acid, which has been shown to be a potential [[allelopathic]] inhibitor of red maple growth. Red maple is one of the first species to start stem elongation. In one study, stem elongation was one-half completed in 1 week, after which growth slowed and was 90% completed within only 54 days. In good light and moisture conditions, the seedlings can grow {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in their first year and up to {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} each year for the next few years making it a fast grower.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\nThe red maple is a used as a food source by several forms of wildlife. [[Elk]] and [[white-tailed deer]] in particular use the current season's growth of red maple as an important source of winter food. Several [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies and moths) utilize the leaves as food; see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on maples]].\n\n[[File:2015-04-12 16 31 55 Male Red Maple flowers on Bayberry Road in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|left|thumb|Male flowers]]\nDue to ''A. rubrum'''s very wide range, there is significant variation in hardiness, size, form, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, have the most reddish fall color, set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. In Florida, at the extreme south of the red maple's range, it is limited exclusively to swamplands. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief, frost-free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As a result of the variation there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation. This is especially useful for making urban [[cultivar]]s that require resistance from [[verticillium wilt]], air pollution, and drought.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\n[[File:Autumn Blaze Maple in Toronto.jpg|right|thumb|160px|''Acer \u00d7 freemanii'' 'Jeffersred' in Toronto]]\nRed maple frequently hybridizes with [[Silver Maple]]; the [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]], known as Freeman's Maple ''Acer x freemanii'', is intermediate between the parents.\n\n=== Allergenic potential ===\nThe allergenic potential of red maples varies widely based on the cultivar.\n\nThe following cultivars are completely [[male]] and are highly allergenic, with an [[OPALS (Ogren Plant Allergy Scale)|OPALS]] allergy scale rating of 8 or higher:<ref name=Ogren>{{cite book|last1=Ogren|first1=Thomas|title=The Allergy-Fighting Garden|date=2015|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=978-1-60774-491-7|pages=54\u201355}}</ref>\n\n* 'Autumn Flame' ('Flame')\n* 'Autumn Spire'\n* 'Columnare' ('Pyramidale')\n* 'Firedance' ('Landsburg')\n* 'Karpick'\n* 'Northwood'\n* 'October Brilliance'\n* 'Sun Valley'\n* 'Tiliford'\n\nThe following cultivars have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 3 or lower; they are completely [[female]] trees, and have low potential for causing allergies:<ref name=\"Ogren\" />\n\n* 'Autumn Glory'\n* 'Bowhall'\n* 'Davey Red'\n* 'Doric'\n* 'Embers'\n* 'Festival'\n* 'October Glory'\n* 'Red Skin'\n* 'Red Sunset' ('Franksred')\n\n=== Toxicity ===\nThe leaves of red maple, especially when dead or wilted, are extremely [[List of plants poisonous to equines|toxic to horses]].

This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads to the production of [[methemoglobin]], which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700&nbsp;grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, [[jaundice]], dark brown urine, [[horse colic|colic]], [[laminitis]], coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of [[methylene blue]] or mineral oil and [[activated carbon]] in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as [[blood transfusion]]s, fluid support, [[diuretic]]s, and anti-oxidants such as [[Vitamin C]].

The wood is close grained and as such it is similar to that of ''A. saccharum'', but its texture is softer, less dense, and has a poorer figure and machining qualities. High grades of wood from the red maple can nonetheless be substituted for hard maple, particularly when it comes to making [[furniture]]. As a soft maple, the wood tends to shrink more during the drying process than with the hard maples.\n\nRed maple is also used for the production of [[maple syrup]], though the hard maples ''[[Acer saccharum]]'' (sugar maple) and ''[[Acer nigrum]]'' (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple, as well as those of the ''[[Acer saccharinum]]'' (silver maple), ''[[Acer negundo]]'' (boxelder), and ''[[Acer platanoides]]'' (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\nRed maple is a medium quality firewood,<ref>{{cite web|title=Heating With Wood: Species Characteristics and Volumes|author=Michael Kuhns and Tom Schmidt|date=n.d.|publisher=UtahState University Cooperative Extension|url=http://extension.usu.edu/forestry/HomeTown/General_HeatingWithWood.htm}}</ref> possessing less heat energy, nominally 5.4 MJ/m\u00b3 (18.7 million BTU (mbtu) per cord), than other hardwoods such as Ash: 7 MJ/m\u00b3 (24 mbtu/cord), Oak: 7 MJ/m\u00b3 (24 mbtu/cord), or Birch: 5.8 MJ/m\u00b3 (20 mbtu/cord).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of plants poisonous to equines]]\n* [[List of foods made from maple]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikispecies}}\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ACRU NRCS: United States Department of Agriculture Plants Profile and map: ''Acer rubrum'']\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/acru.htm ''Acer rubrum'' images from Vanderbilt University]\n*[http://www.portraitoftheearth.com/trees/redsilvermaple.html Portrait of the Earth, Winter ID photos]\n{{Commons category|position=left|Acer rubrum}}\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Acer|rubrum]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Flora of Southeastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Symbols of Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Plants used in bonsai]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

The small tree or shrub is native to the southern and eastern parts of the [[United States]], found from [[Illinois]] to [[Virginia]] in the north and from [[Texas]] to [[Florida]] in the south. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}It is hardy far to the north of its native range, with successful cultivation poleward to Arboretum Mustila in [[Finland]].<ref>http://www.mustila.fi/en/plants/aesculus/pavia</ref>\n\nIt has a number of local names, such as scarlet buckeye, '''woolly buckeye''' and firecracker plant.\n\nThe red buckeye is a large [[shrub]] or small [[tree]]. It reaches a height of 16-26 feet, often growing in a multi-stemmed form.  Its leaves are opposite, and are composed usually of five elliptical serrated leaflets, each 4-6 inches long.  It bears 4-7 inches long clusters of attractive dark red tubular flowers in the spring. The flowers are [[hermaphrodite]]. The smooth light brown fruits, about one inch or so in diameter, reach maturity in early autumn.\n\nThere are two [[variety (biology)|varieties]]:\n*''Aesculus pavia'' var. ''pavia'': typical red buckeye.\n*''Aesculus pavia'' var. ''flavescens'': yellow-flowered red buckeye.\n\nThe yellow-flowered variety, var. ''flavescens'', is found in higher country in Texas, and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] with intermediate flower color occur.\n\nThe flowers are attractive to [[hummingbird]]s as well as [[bee]]s. The fruits are rich in [[saponin]]s, which are poisonous to humans, although not particularly dangerous because they are not ingested easily.  The oils can be extracted to make [[soap]], although this is not viable commercially.\n\nOrnamental [[cultivar]]s such as the low-growing 'Humilis' have been selected for garden use.\n\nRed buckeye has hybridized with common horse-chestnut (''[[Aesculus hippocastanum]]'') in cultivation, the hybrid being named ''[[Aesculus \u00d7 carnea]]'', red horse-chestnut. The hybrid is a medium-sized tree to 45-55 feet tall, intermediate between the parent species in most respects, but inheriting the red flower color from ''A. pavia''. It is a popular tree in large [[garden]]s and [[park]]s, most commonly the selected [[cultivar]] 'Briotii'.  Hybrids of red buckeye with [[yellow buckeye]] (''A. flava'') have also been found, and named ''Aesculus \u00d7 hybrida''.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Red Buckeye Aesculus pavia Flowers 2000px.jpg|A red flower stalk\nImage:Aesculus pavia 2.jpg|Growing habit\nFile:Red Buckeye Aesculus pavia Leaf Cluster 2800px.jpg|Leaf cluster\n<!-- to add more pictures follow the example: Example.jpg|Caption2 -->\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|Aesculus pavia}}{{wikispecies}}\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=AEPA USDA plant profile for Red Buckeye]\n*[http://www.swsbm.com/Images/New2-2001/Aesculus_pavia-flavescens.jpg photo of Yellow Red Buckeye]\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/aepa.htm ''Aesculus pavia'' images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu]\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n[[Category:Aesculus|pavia]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Plains-Midwest (United States)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]",

It is closely related to the Asian species ''[[Aralia elata]]'', a more commonly cultivated species with which it is easily confused.\n\n==Description==\n''Aralia spinosa'' is an aromatic spiny [[deciduous]] [[shrub]] or small tree growing {{convert|2|\u2013|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, with a simple or occasionally branched stem with very large bipinnate [[leaf|leaves]] {{convert|70|\u2013|120|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The trunks are up to {{convert|15|\u2013|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, with the plants umbrella-like in habit with open crowns. The young stems are stout and thickly covered with sharp spines. The plants generally grow in clusters of branchless trunks, although stout wide-spreading branches are occasionally produced.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nThe [[flower]]s are creamy-white, individually small (about 5&nbsp;mm or 0.2&nbsp;in across) but produced in large composite [[panicle]]s {{convert|30|\u2013|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; flowering is in the late summer. The [[fruit]] is a purplish-black [[berry (botany)|berry]] {{convert|6|\u2013|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, ripening in the fall. The roots are thick and fleshy.\n\nThe doubly or triply compound leaves are the largest of any temperate tree in the continental United States, often about a meter (three feet) long and 60&nbsp;cm (two feet) wide, with leaflets about {{convert|5|\u2013|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The petioles are prickly, with swollen bases. In the autumn the leaves turn to a peculiar bronze red touched with yellow which makes the tree conspicuous and attractive.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nThe habit of growth and general appearance of ''Aralia spinosa'' and related tree-forming ''Aralia'' species are unique. It is usually found as a group of unbranched stems, rising to the height of {{convert|3.5|\u2013|6|m|ft|abbr=on}}, which bear upon their summits a crowded cluster of doubly or triply compound leaves, thus giving to each stem a certain tropical [[palm (plant)|palm]]-like appearance.

Branchlets one-half to two-thirds of an inch in diameter, armed with stout, straight or curved, scattered prickles and nearly encircled by narrow leaf scars. At first light yellow brown, shining and dotted, later light brown.\n* Wood: Brown with yellow streaks; light, soft, brittle, close-grained.\n* Winter buds: Terminal bud chestnut brown, one-half to three-fourths of an inch long, conical, blunt; axillary buds flattened, triangular, one-fourth of an inch in length.\n* Leaves: Clustered at the end of the branches, compound, bi- and tri-pinnate, three to four feet long, two and a half feet broad. The pinnae are unequally pinnate, having five or six pairs of leaflets and a long stalked terminal leaflet; these leaflets are often themselves pinnate. The last leaflets are ovate, two to three inches long, wedge-shaped or rounded at base, serrate or dentate, acute; midrib and primary veins prominent. They come out of the bud a bronze green, shining, somewhat hairy; when full grown are dark green above, pale beneath; midribs frequently furnished with prickles. Petioles stout, light brown, eighteen to twenty inches in length, clasping, armed with prickles. Stipules acute, one-half inch long.\n* Flowers: July, August. Perfect or [[polygamomonoecious]], cream white, borne in many-flowered umbels arranged in compound panicles, forming a terminal racemose cluster, three to four feet in length which rises, solitary or two or three together, above the spreading leaves. Bracts and bractlets lanceolate, acute, persistent.\n* Calyx: Calyx tube coherent with the ovary, minutely five-toothed.\n* Corolla: Petals five, white, inserted on margin of the disk, acute, slightly inflexed at the apex, imbricate in bud.\n* Stamens: Five, inserted on margin of the disk, alternate with the petals; filaments thread-like; anthers oblong, attached on the back, introrse, two-celled; cells opening longitudinally.\n* Pistil: Ovary inferior, five-celled; styles five, connivent; stigmas capitate.\n* Fruit: Berry-like drupe, globular, black, one-fourth of an inch long, five-angled, crowned with the blackened styles. Flesh thin, dark.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Aralia spinosa'' is widespread in the eastern [[United States]], ranging from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Florida]] along the Atlantic coast, and westward to [[Ohio]], [[Illinois]], and [[Texas]]. It prefers a deep moist soil.<ref name=Keeler />  The plants typically grow in the forest [[Understory]] or at the edges of forests, often forming [[vegetative reproduction|clonal]] thickets by sprouting from the roots.\n\nThis tree was admired by the [[Iroquois]] because of its usefulness, and for its rarity. The Iroquois would take the saplings of the tree and plant them near their villages and on islands, so that animals wouldn't eat the valuable fruit. The fruit was used in many of the natives' foods. The women would take the flowers and put them in their hair because of the lemony smell. The flowers could also be traded for money.\n\n==Uses==\n\nThe young leaves can be eaten if gathered before the prickles harden. They are then chopped finely and cooked as a [[potherb]].\n\n''Aralia spinosa'' was introduced into cultivation in 1688 and is still grown for its decorative foliage, prickly stems, large showy flower [[panicle]]s [clusters], and distinctive fall color. These plants are slow growing, tough and durable, do well in urban settings, but bear numerous prickles on their stems, petioles, and leaflets. These plants can be propagated from seeds or root cuttings.<ref>[[Janet Meakin Poor|Poor, Janet Meakin]], and Nancy P. Brewster. 1994. ''Plants that merit attention Vol 2, Shrubs''.

Cross-[[pollination]] of at least two different [[genotype|genetic varieties]] of the plant is recommended,<ref name=\"KSU\"/> and growers often resort to hand pollination or to use of [[pollinator]] attractants such as spraying fish emulsion or hanging chicken necks or other meat near the open flowers to attract pollinators. While pawpaws are larval hosts for the [[zebra swallowtail butterfly]], these caterpillars are usually present only at low density, and not detrimental to the foliage of the trees.<ref name=CRFG/>\n\nPawpaws have never been cultivated for their fruits on the scale of [[apple|apples (''Malus domestica'')]] or [[peach|peaches (''Prunus persica'')]], primarily because pawpaw fruits ripen to the point of [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] soon after they are picked, and only frozen fruit will store or ship well. Other methods of preservation include [[dehydration]], production of [[Fruit preserves#Jam|jams]] or [[Fruit preserves#Jelly|jellies]], and pressure [[canning]] (using the numerical values for bananas).\n\nIn recent years, cultivation of pawpaws for fruit production has attracted renewed interest, particularly among [[organic farming|organic growers]], as a native fruit with few to no pests, successfully grown without [[pesticide]]s.

Germination is [[hypogeal germination|hypogeal]] and cotyledons remain within the seed coat. Strictly speaking, hypogeal means the cotyledons stay in the soil, acting as a food store for the seedling until the plumule emerges from the soil on the epicotyl or true stem. However, pawpaw seeds have occasionally been observed to emerge from the ground and form the true stem and plumule above ground. Desirable kinds ([[cultivar]]s) of pawpaw are propagated by [[chip budding]] or whip [[grafting]].\n\nSeeds will lose viability if they dehydrate to 5% moisture.<ref name=\"propagation\">{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237403049_Propagation_of_Pawpaw_Asimina_triloba|title=Propagation of Pawpaw (Asimina triloba)|publisher=International Plant Propagators' Society.

It is common throughout coastal areas of [[Texas]] and [[Florida]], and ranges as far north as southern [[Louisiana]] and coastal [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the [[United States]].\n\nLike many other [[mangrove]] species, it reproduces by [[vivipary]]. [[Seed]]s are encased in a [[fruit]], which reveals the [[Germination|germinated]] seedling when it falls into the water.\n\nUnlike other mangrove species, it does not grow on [[Aerial root#Aerial roots as supports|prop roots]], but possesses [[Aerial root#Pneumatophores|pneumatophores]] that allow its roots to breathe even when submerged. It is a hardy species and expels absorbed salt mainly from its leathery leaves.\n\nThe name \"black mangrove\" refers to the color of the trunk and [[Wood#Heartwood and sapwood|heartwood]]. The leaves often appear whitish from the [[salt]] [[Halophyte|excreted]] at night and on cloudy days. It is often found in its native range with the red mangrove (''[[Rhizophora mangle]]'') and the white mangrove (''[[Laguncularia racemosa]]''). White mangroves grow inland from black mangroves which themselves grow inland from red mangroves. The three species work together to stabilize the shoreline, provide buffers from [[storm surge]]s, trap debris and [[detritus]] brought in by [[tide]]s, and provide feeding, breeding, and nursery grounds for a great variety of [[fish]], [[shellfish]], [[bird]]s, and other wildlife.\n\n==Habitat==\n[[Image:Black mangrove-everglades natl park.jpg|left|thumb|A black mangrove tree growing in shallow water in [[Everglades National Park]]]]\n[[Image:Avicennia germinans-flowers2.jpg|left|thumb|Black mangrove flowers]]\nThe black mangrove grows just above the high [[tide]] in coastal [[lagoon]]s and [[brackish water]] [[Estuary|estuaries]].

The wood is strong, heavy, and hard, but is difficult to work due to its interlocked grain and is somewhat difficult to finish due to its oily texture. Uses include posts, pilings, [[charcoal]], and [[Firewood|fuel]]. Despite growing in a marine environment, the dry wood is subject to attack by marine borers and [[termite]]s.

[[Nymph (biology)|Nymphs]] of the [[pineapple gall adelgid]] form galls at the base of twigs which resemble miniature pineapples and those of the [[Gall adelgid|Cooley's spruce gall adelgid]] cause cone-shaped galls at the tips of branches. The larva of the [[spruce budworm]] eat the buds and growing shoots while the [[spruce needle miner]] hollows out the needles and makes them coalesce in a webbed mass. An elongated white [[scale insect]], the [[Chionaspis pinifoliae|pine needle scale]] feeds on the needles causing fluffy white patches on the twigs and aphids also suck sap from the needles and may cause them to fall and possibly dieback. Mites can also infest the blue spruce, especially in a dry summer, causing yellowing of the oldest needles.<ref name=IFAS>{{cite web |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/st453 |title=''Picea pungens'': Colorado Spruce |author1=Gilman, Edward F. |author2=Watson, Dennis G. |date=2011-05-01 |work=EDIS |publisher=IFAS Extension Service: University of Florida |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/insect/05514.html |title=Scale Insects Affecting Conifers |author=Cranshaw, W.

Various rust diseases also affect the tree causing yellowing of the needles as well as needle fall. [[Canker]] caused by ''[[Cytospora]]'' attacks one of the lower branches first and progressively makes its way higher up the tree. The first symptom is the needles turning reddish-brown and falling off. Meanwhile, patches of white [[resin]] appear on the bark and the branch eventually dies.<ref name=IFAS/>\n\n===Cultivars===\n[[File:Picea pungens 'Glauca globosa' in Autumn.JPG|thumb|Foliage of the cultivar 'Glauca globosa']]\n\nCommon cultivars (those marked {{smallcaps|agm}} have gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]]):- \n*'Glauca Globosa'{{smallcaps|agm}}<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Picea pungens'' 'Globosa'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1465|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref> - shrub from {{convert|3|-|5|ft|m}} in height<ref>[http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/c825/picea-pungens-glauca-globosa.aspx Missouri Botanical Garden: ''Picea pungens'' 'Glauca Globosa']</ref> \n*'Fat Albert' - compact perfect cone to {{convert|10|ft|m}} of a silver blue color<ref>[http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/e660/picea-pungens-fat-albert.aspx Missouri Botanical Garden: ''Picea pungens'' Fat Albert]</ref>\n*'Glauca Jean's Dilly' - shrub from {{convert|3|-|6|ft|m}} in height<ref>[http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/a421/picea-glauca-jean's-dilly.aspx Missouri Botanical Garden: ''Picea pungens'' 'Glauca Jean's Dilly']</ref>\n*'Glauca Pendula' - drooping branches, spreads to about {{convert|8|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|4|ft|m}} tall<ref>[http://www.finegardening.com/plantguide/picea-pungens-glauca-pendula-colorado-blue-spruce.aspx Fine Gardening Plant Guide: Picea pungens \u2018Glauca Pendula']</ref>\n*'Hoopsii' {{smallcaps|agm}}<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Picea pungens'' 'Hoopsii'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1466|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>\n*'Koster'<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Picea pungens'' 'Koster'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1467|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>\n*'Baby Blue Eyes'<ref>{{cite web|title=Missouri Botanical Garden - ''Picea pungens 'Baby Blueeyes'| url=http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/d137/picea-pungens-baby-blueeyes.aspx}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Washington State University - ''Picea pungens 'Baby Blueeyes'| url=http://www.pnwplants.wsu.edu/PlantDisplay.aspx?PlantID=243}}</ref>\n*'Baby Blue' <ref>{{cite web|title=West Montrose Farms Ltd - ''Picea pungens 'Baby Blue'| url=http://www.babybluespruce.com/}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nThe [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Keresan languages|Keres]] Native Americans used this tree as a traditional [[medicinal plant]] and a ceremonial item, and twigs are given as gifts to bring good fortune.

The [[flower]]s are small wind-pollinated [[catkin]]s, produced in spring. The [[fruit]] is a very bitter [[nut (fruit)|nut]], {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long with a green four-valved cover which splits off at maturity in the fall, and a hard, bony shell. Another identifying characteristic is its bright sulfur-yellow winter bud.\n\nIt is closely related to the [[pecan]], sharing similar leaf shape and being classified in the same section of the genus ''Carya'' sect. ''Apocarya'', but unlike the pecan, it does not have edible nuts. It is most readily distinguished from the pecan by the smaller number of leaflets, with many leaves having only 7 leaflets (rarely fewer than 9, and often 11\u201313, in the pecan). [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrids]] with the pecan are known, and named ''Carya'' \u00d7 ''brownii''. A hybrid between the shagbark hickory (''C. ovata'') is also recognized, and is known as Laney's hickory (''Carya'' \u00d7''laneyi'').<ref>http://www.freefictionbooks.org/books/n/18194-northern-nut-growers-association-report-of-the-pro?start=97</ref>\n[[File:Carya cordiformis NRCS-1.jpg|thumb|right|Bitternut leaf]]\n\n== Habitat ==\n[[File:Carya cordiformis leaves.jpg|thumb|left|Branch of a bitternut hickory with developing nuts]]\nBitternut hickory grows in moist mountain valleys along streambanks and in swamps. Although it is usually found on wet bottom lands, it grows on dry sites and also grows well on poor soils low in nutrients. The species is not included as a titled species in the Society of American Foresters forest cover types because it does not grow in sufficient numbers.\n\n== Range ==\n[[File:Bitternutrangemap.jpg|thumb|left|US range map of ''Carya cordiformis'']]\n\nBitternut hickory grows throughout the eastern United States from southwestern New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and southern Quebec; west to southern Ontario, central Michigan, and northern Minnesota; south to eastern Texas; and east to northwestern Florida and Georgia. It is most common, however, from southern New England west to Iowa and from southern Michigan south to Kentucky. It is probably the most abundant and most uniformly distributed of all the hickories.\n\n== Uses ==\nBitternut is used for lumber and pulpwood. Because bitternut hickory wood is hard and durable, it is used for furniture, paneling, dowels, tool handles and ladders. Like other hickories, the [[wood]] is used for [[smoking (food)|smoking]] [[meat]], and by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for making [[bow (weapon)|bows]]. Bitternut hickory seeds and its bark are eaten by wildlife.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons and category-inline}}\n* {{Wikispecies-inline}}\n* [http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/caco15.htm ''Carya cordiformis'' images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu]*\n* [http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/ClimateChange/2ColumnSubPage/267031.html Ontario Tree Atlas: Bitternut Hickory (Carya Cordiformis)]\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Carya|cordiformis]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Hardwood forest plants]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]",

The  remarkable bark pattern is even more pronounced in younger trees, with the irregularly-spaced ridges resembling long geologic palisades of sedimentary [layered] rock formations when viewed edge-wise [cross-section]. Coins as large as USA quarters can easily be laid flat against the valleys, which may be as deep as an adult human finger.\n\nThe leaves are distinctly asymmetrical and coarse-textured.  It produces small fruits that turn orange-red to dark purple in the [[autumn]], often staying on the trees for several months.  The common hackberry is easily confused with the [[sugarberry]] (''[[Celtis laevigata]]'') and is most easily distinguished by range and habitat.

Hackberry's range overlaps with the sugarberry (''Celtis laevigata''), making it difficult to establish the exact range of either species in the South. Although there is little actual overlap, in the western part of its range the common hackberry is sometimes confused with the smaller netleaf hackberry (''Celtis reticulata''), which has a similar bark. Hackberry grows in many different habitats, although it prefers bottomlands and soils high in [[limestone]].  Its [[shade tolerance]] is greatly dependent on conditions.  In favorable conditions its seedlings will persist under a closed canopy, but in less favorable conditions it can be considered shade intolerant.|date=September 2016}}\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Celtis-occidentalis-fruits.JPG|thumb|right|Fruits]]\n\nHackberry is highly susceptible to fire damage.  The leaves are eaten by four gall-producing insects of the ''[[Pachypsylla]]'' genus, which do not cause serious damage to the tree.  A number of insects and fungi cause rapid decay of dead branches or roots of the tree.\n\nThe small berries, hackberries, are eaten by a number of birds and mammals.  Most seeds are dispersed by animals, but some seeds are also dispersed by water.\n\nThe tree serves as a butterfly larval host particularly the [[hackberry emperor]].<ref>http://www.nativeplantcenter.net/?q=plants/1211</ref>\n\n== Cultivation and uses ==\n[[File:Bodjos sombor.jpg|thumb|right|One of the streets with 'bo\u0111o\u0161' in Sombor, Serbia]]\nHackberry's wood is light yellow; heavy, soft, coarse-grained, not strong.  It rots easily, making the wood undesirable commercially, although it is occasionally used for fencing and cheap furniture.  [[Specific gravity]], 0.7287; weight of cu. ft., {{convert|45.41|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nHackberry is only occasionally used as a street or landscape tree, although its tolerance for urban conditions makes it well suited to this role. Ridjica and [[Sombor]] in [[Serbia]] (where it is called \u0431\u043e\u0452\u043e\u0448 / ''bo\u0111o\u0161'' {{IPA-sh|bod\u0291o\u0283|}} in Sombor, \u0433\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0443\u045a\u0430 / ''galagunja'' {{IPA-sh|galagu\u0272a|}} in [[Subotica]], and \u043a\u043e\u0448\u045b\u0435\u043b\u0430 / ''ko\u0161\u0107ela'' {{IPA-sh|ko\u0283t\u0255ela|}} in the rest of the country) and [[Bratislava]], the capital of [[Slovakia]], are known for the extensive use of hackberry (in the latter case along with closely related but Eurasian ''[[Celtis australis]]'') as a street tree.\n\nThe tree's pea-sized berries are edible, ripening in early September. Unlike most fruits, the berries are remarkably high in calories from fat, carbohydrate and protein, and these calories are easily digestible without any cooking or preparation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thayer |first1=Samuel |title=Nature's Garden |date=2010 |publisher=Forager's Harvest |location=Birchwood, WI |isbn=978-0-9766266-1-9 |page=130}}</ref> Omaha Native Americans ate the berries casually, while the Dakota used them as a flavor for meat, pounding them fine, seeds and all.

The common name is '''desert willow'''<ref name=usda>[http://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=chli2 ''Chilopsis linearis''.] USDA PLANTS.</ref> or '''desert-willow'''<ref name=ns>[http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?searchName=chilopsis+linearis ''Chilopsis linearis''.] NatureServe. 2012.</ref> because of its [[willow]]-like leaves, but it is a member of the [[catalpa]] family, [[Bignoniaceae]]. It is commonly seen in [[Arroyo (creek)|washes]] and [[Riparian zone|along riverbanks]] at elevations below 1800m in its range.\n\n==Description==\nRanging from 1.5 to as much as 8 meters in height, it can take the form of a shrub or small tree. The linear, curved, [[deciduous]] leaves are 10 to 26&nbsp;cm long and just a few millimeters wide.\n{{commons|Chilopsis linearis}}\nThe generic name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''\u03c7\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2'', (''cheilos''), meaning \"lip,\" and ''\u1f44\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2'' (''opsis''), meaning \"resembling,\" referring to the [[flower]]s. They occur in a terminal [[panicle]] or [[raceme]], blooming in May through September. About two to four flowers at a time are open in each inflorescence. The [[sepal|calyx]] is about 8\u201314&nbsp;mm, slightly inflated, and varying shades of purple, while the [[Petal#Corolla|corolla]] is 2\u20135&nbsp;cm, and with colors ranging from lavender to light pink. The throat and lower lip has a pattern of yellow ridges and purple lines, and the margins are crinkled. It is pollinated primarily by large [[bee]]s in the family [[Apidae]], such as [[carpenter bee]]s, [[bumblebee]]s, ''[[Anthophora]]'', and ''[[Centris]]''. The [[fruit]] is a linear pod up to 35&nbsp;cm long, containing numerous winged [[seed]]s.\n\nThere are two [[subspecies]]:\n*''Chilopsis linearis'' subsp. ''linearis''. Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, western Texas, Mexico. \n*''Chilopsis linearis'' subsp. ''arcuata''. Nevada, California, Baja California.\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n\nIt is cultivated for its large, showy [[flower]]s, and tolerance of hot, dry climates. Although the natural growth is a very irregular shape, it can be readily pruned into a conventional tree shape. A number of [[cultivar]]s have been selected. Some, such as 'Rio Salado', have dark purple or magenta flowers.\n\nChilopsis may survive temperatures as low as 10 degrees F (-12&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\n''Chilopsis'' is closely related to the genus ''[[Catalpa]]'' and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] can be made between the two genera. The [[nothogeneric]] hybrid between ''Chilopsis linearis'' and ''[[Southern Catalpa|Catalpa bignonioides]]'' has been named [[Chitalpa|\u00d7''Chitalpa tashkentensis'']]. It originated in a botanic garden at [[Tashkent]] in [[Uzbekistan]].\n\nParts of the plant have been used in [[traditional medicine]].

It grows to heights of 10\u201325 m (32.8-82.0&nbsp;ft), and its trunk diameter reaches 0.5 m (19.7&nbsp;in). The foliage grows in dense sprays, varying from dull gray-green to bright glaucous blue-green. The [[leaf|leaves]] are scale-like, 2\u20135&nbsp;mm long, and produced on rounded (not flattened) shoots. The seed [[conifer cone|cones]] are globose to oblong, 15\u201333&nbsp;mm long, with 6 or 8 (rarely 4 or 10) scales, green at first, maturing gray or gray-brown about 20\u201324 months after pollination. The cones remain closed for many years, only opening after the parent tree is killed in a [[wildfire]], thereby allowing the [[seed]]s to colonize the bare ground exposed by the fire.

In summer, this species produces fragrant flowers which are [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], so one must have both male and female plants to obtain fruit. Most cultivars are [[parthenocarpic]] (setting seedless fruit without pollination). The flowers are [[Pollination|pollinated]] by insects and wind. Fruiting typically begins when the tree is about 6 years old.\n\nThe fruit is round or oval and usually orange-yellow, sometimes bluish, and from 2 to 6&nbsp;cm (0.79 to 2.4 in) in diameter. In the U.S. South and Midwest, the fruits are referred to as simply persimmons or \"'simmons\", and are popular in desserts and cuisine.\n\nCommercial varieties include the very productive Early Golden, the productive John Rick, Miller, Woolbright and the Ennis, a seedless variety.

In the male flowers, which are numerous, the stamens are sixteen in number and arranged in pairs; the female flowers are solitary, with traces of stamens, and a smooth ovary with one ovule in each of the eight cells\u2014the ovary is surmounted by four styles, which are hairy at the base. The fruit-stalk is very short, bearing a [[subglobose]] fruit an inch in diameter or a bit larger, of an orange-yellow color, ranging to bluish, and with a sweetish astringent pulp.  It is surrounded at the base by the persistent calyx-lobes, which increase in size as the fruit ripens.  The astringency renders the fruit somewhat unpalatable, but after it has been subjected to the action of frost, or has become partially rotted or \"[[bletting|bletted]]\" like a [[medlar]], its flavor is improved.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Persimmon |inline=1 |volume=21 |page=252}}</ref>\n* Bark: Dark brown or dark gray, deeply divided into plates whose surface is scaly.  Branchlets slender, zigzag, with thick pith or large pith cavity; at first light reddish brown and pubescent.  They vary in color from light brown to ashy gray and finally become reddish brown, the bark somewhat broken by longitudinal fissures.  Astringent and bitter.\n* Wood: Very dark; sapwood yellowish white; heavy, hard, strong and very close grained.  Specific gravity, 0.7908; weight of cubic foot, {{convert|49.28|lb|abbr=on}}.  The heartwood is a true [[ebony]].  Forestry texts indicate that about a century of growth is required before a tree will produce a commercially viable yield of ebony wood.\n* Winter buds: Ovate, acute, one-eighth of an inch long, covered with thick reddish or purple scales.  These scales are sometimes persistent at the base of the branchlets.\n* Leaves: Alternate, simple, four to six inches (152&nbsp;mm)  long, oval, narrowed or rounded or cordate at base, entire, acute or acuminate.  They come out of the bud revolute, thin, pale, reddish green, downy with ciliate margins, when full grown are thick, dark green, shining above, pale and often pubescent beneath.  In autumn they sometimes turn orange or scarlet, sometimes fall without change of color.  Midrib broad and flat, primary veins opposite and conspicuous.  Petioles stout, pubescent, one-half to an inch in length.\n* Flowers: May, June, when leaves are half-grown; di\u0153cious or rarely polygamous.  Staminate flowers borne in two to three-flowered cymes; the pedicels downy and bearing two minute bracts.  Pistillate flowers solitary, usually on separate trees, their pedicels short, recurved, and bearing two bractlets.\n* Calyx: Usually four-lobed, accrescent under the fruit.\n* Corolla: Greenish yellow or creamy white, tubular, four-lobed; lobes imbricate in bud.\n* Stamens: Sixteen, inserted on the corolla, in staminate flowers in two rows.  Filaments short, slender, slightly hairy; anthers oblong, introrse, two-celled, cells opening longitudinally.  In pistillate flowers the stamens are eight with aborted anthers, rarely these stamens are perfect.\n* Pistil: Ovary superior, conical, ultimately eight-celled; styles four, slender, spreading; stigma two-lobed.\n* Fruit: A juicy berry containing one to eight seeds, crowned with the remnants of the style and seated in the enlarged calyx; depressed-globular, pale orange color, often red-cheeked; with slight bloom, turning yellowish brown after freezing.

However, as it is attractive to raccoons, rodents, and smaller animals, the loss of large grazing herbivores and omnivores in historical times has not seriously affected the tree's survival strategy as compared to [[Kentucky Coffeetree]] and [[Osage Orange]] which are inedible to most extant wildlife and saw their ranges greatly diminish without [[mastodon]]s and other dispersal agent fauna.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  A 2015 study supports the notion that elephants would have been a more effective disperser of the seeds than living North American mammals <ref>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1656/058.014.0109</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nThe peculiar characteristics of its fruit have made the tree well known.  This fruit is a globular berry, with variation in the number of seeds, sometimes with eight and sometimes without any.  It bears at its apex the remnants of the styles and sits in the enlarged and persistent calyx.  It ripens in late autumn, is pale orange with a red cheek, often covered with a slight glaucous bloom.  One joke among Southerners is to induce strangers to taste unripe persimmon fruit, as its very astringent bitterness is shocking to those unfamiliar with it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  Folklore states that frost is required to make it edible, but fully ripened fruit lightly shaken from the tree or found on the ground below the tree is sweet, juicy and delicious.  The peculiar astringency of the fruit is due to the presence of a tannin similar to that of ''[[Cinchona]]''.  The seeds were used as buttons during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BeA1AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA234&dq=persimmon+seed+buttons&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vQ27UZeGL8bw0QGGjoCIDg&ved=0CEgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=persimmon%20seed%20buttons&f=false|title=Domestic Economy in the Confederacy|first=David|last=Dodge|year=1886|journal=The Atlantic Monthly |volume=58|issue=August|pages=229\u2013241}}</ref>\n\nThe fruit is high in [[vitamin C]]. The unripe fruit is extremely [[astringent]]. The ripe fruit may be eaten raw, cooked or dried. [[Molasses]] can be made from the fruit pulp. A [[Herbal tea|tea]] can be made from the leaves and the roasted seed is used as a [[coffee]] substitute. Other popular uses include desserts such as persimmon [[pie]], [[persimmon pudding]], or [[persimmon candy]].\n\nThe fruit is also fermented with [[hops]], [[cornmeal]] or [[wheat bran]] into a sort of beer or made into brandy.  The wood is heavy, strong and very close-grained and used in [[woodturning]].<ref name=EB1911 />\n\n==Cultivation==\nThe tree prefers light, sandy, well-drained soil, but will grow in rich, southern, bottom lands.  It can be grown in northern Ohio only with the greatest of care, and in southern Ohio its fruit is never edible until after frost.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nThe tree is greatly inclined to vary in the character and quality of its fruit, in size this varies from that of a large cherry to a small apple.  Some trees in the south produce fruit that is delicious without the action of the frost, while adjoining trees produce fruit that never becomes edible.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nIt was brought to England before 1629 and is cultivated, but rarely if ever ripens its fruit.  It is easily raised from seed and can also be propagated from [[stolon]]s, which are often produced in great quantity.  The tree is hardy in the south of England and in the Channel Islands.<ref name=EB1911 />\n\nIn respect to the power of making [[heartwood]], the persimmon rarely develops any heartwood until it is nearly one hundred years old.  This heartwood is extremely close-grained and almost black, resembling [[ebony]] (of which it is a true variety).<ref name=Keeler /><ref>The ebony of commerce is derived from five different tropical species of the genus, two from [[India]] and one each from [[Africa]], [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] and [[Mauritius]].  The beautiful variegated [[Calamander wood|coromandel wood]] is the product of a species found in [[Ceylon]].</ref>\n\nIt is a common misconception persimmon fruit needs frost to ripen and soften, called [[bletting]]. Some, such as the early-ripening varieties \"pieper\" and \"NC21\"(also known as \"supersweet\"), easily lose astringency and become completely free of it when slightly soft at the touch\u2014these are then very sweet, even in the British climate. On the other hand, some varieties (like the very large fruited \"yates\", which is a late ripening variety) remain astringent even when the fruit has become completely soft (at least in the British climate). Frost, however, destroys the cells within the fruit, causing it to rot instead of ripen. Only completely ripe and soft fruit can stand some frost; it will then dry and become even sweeter (hence the misconception). The same goes for the Oriental persimmon (''[[Diospyros kaki]]''), where early frost can severely damage a fruit crop.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikispecies}}\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=divi5 USDA Plants Profile for ''Diospyros virginiana'' (common persimmon)]\n*[http://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=DIVI5 Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center\u2014Native Plant Information Network (NPIN): ''Diospyros virginiana'' (Common persimmon, Eastern persimmon)]\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/divi5.htm Bioimages.vanderbilt.edu: ''Diospyros virginiana'' images]\n*[http://www.persimmonpudding.com Persimmonpudding.com - dedicated to growing, education, and use of ''Diospyros virginiana'', the Common or American persimmon]\n*[http://www.treetrail.net/diospyros.html Treetrail.net: ''Diospyros virginiana'' (American Persimmon) Native Range Distribution Map]\n{{Commons category|position=left}}\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n[[Category:Diospyros|virginiana]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Crops originating from the United States]]\n[[Category:Dioecious plants]]\n[[Category:Plants used in Native American cuisine]]\n[[Category:Native American cuisine of the Southeastern Woodlands]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]",

''glauca'']])}}\n}}\n\n'''''Pseudotsuga menziesii''''', commonly known as '''Douglas fir''' or '''Douglas-fir''', is an [[evergreen]] [[conifer]] [[species]] [[native plant|native]] to western [[North America]]. One variety, the coast Douglas fir, grows along the Pacific Ocean from central [[British Columbia]] south to central [[California]]. A second variety, the Rocky Mountain Douglas fir, grows in the [[Rocky Mountains]] from British Columbia south to [[Mexico]]. The tree is dominant in western [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. It is extensively used for timber, worldwide.\n\n== Naming ==\nThe common name honors [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]], a Scottish botanist and collector who first reported the extraordinary nature and potential of the species. The common name is misleading since it is not a true fir, i.e., not a member of the genus ''[[Abies]]''. For this reason the name is often written as '''Douglas-fir''' (a name also used for the genus ''[[Pseudotsuga]]'' as a whole).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oregonstate.edu/trees/conifer_genera/douglas_fir.html |title=Douglas-fir (''Pseudotsuga'') |work=Common Trees of the Pacific Northwest |publisher=Oregon State University |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe specific epithet, ''menziesii'', is after [[Archibald Menzies]], a Scottish physician and rival [[Natural history|naturalist]] to [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]]. Menzies first documented the tree on [[Vancouver Island]] in 1791. Colloquially, the species is also known simply as '''Doug-fir''' or as '''Douglas pine''' (although the latter common name may also refer to ''[[Pinus douglasiana]]'').\n\nOne [[Coast Salish]] name for the tree, used in the [[Halkomelem]] language, is ''l\u00e1:yelhp''.<ref>Dictionary of Upriver Halkomelem, Volume I, pp. 213. Galloway, Brent Douglas.</ref>\n\n==Description==\nDouglas firs are medium-size to extremely large [[evergreen]] [[tree]]s, {{convert|20|-|100|m|-1}} tall (although only coast Douglas firs reach such great height).<ref>{{cite book|title=Forest Giants of the World Past and Present|first=Al|last=Carder|year=1995|pages=3\u20134}}</ref> The [[leaf|leaves]] are flat, soft, linear, {{convert|2|-|4|cm|in|1}} long, generally resembling those of the firs, occurring singly rather than in [[fascicle (botany)|fascicle]]s; they completely encircle the branches, which can be useful in recognizing the species. As the trees grow taller in denser forest, they lose their lower branches, such that the foliage may start high off the ground. Douglas firs in environments with more light may have branches much closer to the ground.\n\nThe female [[Conifer cone|cones]] are pendulous, with persistent scales unlike true firs. They are distinctive in having a long tridentine (three-pointed) [[bract]] that protrudes prominently above each scale (it resembles the back half of a mouse, with two feet and a tail).\n\n== Distribution ==\nOne [[Variety (botany)|variety]], [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|coast Douglas fir]] (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var. ''menziesii''), grows in the coastal regions, from west-central [[British Columbia]] southward to central [[California]]. In [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], its range is continuous from the eastern edge of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] west to the [[Pacific Coast Ranges]] and Pacific Ocean. In California, it is found in the [[Klamath Mountains|Klamath]] and [[California Coast Ranges]] as far south as the [[Santa Lucia Range]], with a small stand as far south as the [[Purisima Hills]] in Santa Barbara County.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A New Douglas-Fir Locality in Southern California |author=James R.

It occurs from near sea level along the coast to {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level in the mountains of California.\n\nFurther inland, coast Douglas fir is replaced by another variety, [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca|Rocky Mountain or interior Douglas fir]] (''P.&nbsp;menziesii'' var. ''glauca''). Interior Douglas fir intergrades with coast Douglas fir in the Cascades of northern Washington and southern British Columbia, and from there ranges northward to central British Columbia and southeastward to the Mexican border, becoming increasingly disjunct as latitude decreases and altitude increases.  [[Pseudotsuga lindleyana|Mexican Douglas fir]] (''P.&nbsp;lindleyana''), which ranges as far south as [[Oaxaca]], is often considered a variety of ''P. menziesii''.\n\n== Ecology ==\nDouglas-fir prefers acidic or neutral soils.<ref>https://www.arborday.org/trees/treeguide/treedetail.cfm?itemID=836</ref>  However, Douglas fir exhibits considerable morphological plasticity, and on drier sites coast Douglas fir will generate deeper taproots.  Interior Douglas fir exhibits even greater plasticity, occurring in stands of interior temperate rainforest in British Columbia, as well as at the edge of semi-arid sagebrush steppe throughout much of its range, where it generates even deeper taproots than coast Douglas fir is capable.\n[[File:Pseudotsuga menziesii 01221.JPG|left|thumb|upright|A [[snag (ecology)|snag]] provides nest cavities for birds]]\n\nMature or \"old-growth\" Douglas fir forest is the primary habitat of the [[red tree vole]] (''Arborimus longicaudus'') and the [[spotted owl]] (''Strix occidentalis''). Home range requirements for breeding pairs of spotted owls are at least 400&nbsp;ha ({{convert|4|km2|acre|disp=comma}}) of old-growth. Red tree voles may also be found in immature forests if Douglas fir is a significant component. This animal nests almost exclusively in the foliage of Douglas fir trees. Nests are located {{convert|2|-|50|m|ft|round=5}} above the ground. The red vole's diet consists chiefly of Douglas fir needles. A [[parasitic plant]] sometimes utilizing ''P. menziesii'' is [[Douglas-fir dwarf mistletoe]] (''Arceuthobium douglasii'').\n\nThe leaves are also used by the [[Adelgidae|woolly conifer aphid]] ''[[Adelges cooleyi]]''; this 0.5&nbsp;mm long [[Sap (plant)|sap]]-sucking [[insect]] is conspicuous on the undersides of the leaves by the small white \"fluff spots\" of protective wax that it produces. It is often present in large numbers, and can cause the foliage to turn yellowish from the damage in causes. Exceptionally, trees may be partially defoliated by it, but the damage is rarely this severe. Among [[Lepidoptera]], apart from some that feed on ''[[Pseudotsuga]]'' in general (see there) the [[gelechiid moth]]s ''Chionodes abella'' and ''C. periculella'' as well as the cone scale-eating [[tortrix moth]] ''[[Cydia illutana]]'' have been recorded specifically on ''P. menziesii''.\n\n[[File:Pseudotsuga menziesii 7971.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Mature individual in the [[Wenatchee Mountains]]]]\n\nThe coast Douglas fir variety is the dominant tree west of the Cascade Mountains in the [[Pacific Northwest]], occurring in nearly all forest types, competes well on most parent materials, aspects, and slopes. Adapted to a moist, mild climate, it grows larger and faster than [[Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir|Rocky Mountain Douglas fir]]. Associated trees include [[western hemlock]], [[Sitka spruce]], [[sugar pine]], [[western white pine]], [[ponderosa pine]], [[grand fir]], [[coast redwood]], [[western redcedar]], [[incense-cedar|California incense-cedar]], [[Chamaecyparis lawsoniana|Lawson's cypress]], [[tanoak]], [[bigleaf maple]] and several others. Pure stands are also common, particularly north of the [[Umpqua River]] in Oregon.\n\n[[Poriol]] is a flavanone, a type of flavonoid, produced by ''P. menziesii'' in reaction to infection by ''[[Poria weirii]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Barton | first1 = G.M. | year = 1972 | title = New C-methylflavanones from Douglas fir | url = | journal = Phytochemistry | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 426\u2013429 | doi = 10.1016/S0031-9422(00)90036-0 }}</ref>\n\n== Forest succession ==\nThe shade-intolerance of Douglas fir plays a large role in the forest [[Ecological succession|succession]] of lowland old growth rainforest communities of the Pacific Northwest. While mature stands of lowland old-growth rainforest contain many [[western hemlock]] (''Tsuga heterophylla'') seedlings, and some [[western redcedar]] (''Thuja plicata'') seedlings, Douglas fir dominated stands contain almost no Douglas fir seedlings. This seeming contradiction occurs because Douglas firs are intolerant of deep shade and rarely survive for long within the shaded understory.  When a tree dies in a mature [[forest]] the canopy opens up and sunlight becomes available as a source of energy for new growth. The shade-tolerant western hemlock seedlings that sprout beneath the canopy have a head-start on other seedlings. This competitive advantage allows the western hemlock to grow rapidly into the sunlight, while other [[seedling]]s still struggle to emerge from the soil. The boughs of the growing western hemlock limit the sunlight for smaller trees and severely limit the chances of shade-intolerant trees, such as the Douglas fir. Over the course of centuries, western hemlock typically come to dominate the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] of an old-growth lowland rainforest.\n\nDouglas firs are [[seral]] trees in [[temperate rainforest]], and possess thicker bark and a somewhat faster growth rate than most other climax trees of the area, such as the western hemlock and western redcedar. This quality often gives Douglas firs a competitive advantage when the forest experiences a major disturbance such as fire. Periodically, portions of a Pacific Northwest lowland forest may be burned by wildfire, may be logged, or may be blown down by a wind storm. These types of disturbances allow Douglas fir to regenerate in openings, and low-intensity fires often leave Douglas fir trees standing on drier sites, while less drought- and fire-tolerant species are unable to get established.\n\n[[File:Red Creek Fir.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Red Creek fir]], about {{convert|15|km|mi}} from [[Port Renfrew]], in [[British Columbia]], measures {{convert|43.7|ft|m}} around its base and stretches {{convert|242|ft|m}} high]]\n\nConifers dominate the climax forests of the coast Douglas fir. All of the climax conifers that grow alongside it can live for centuries, with a few species capable of living for over a millennium. Forests that exist on this time scale experience the type of sporadic disturbances that allow mature stands of Douglas fir to establish themselves as a persistent element within a mature old-growth forest. When [[old growth forests]] survive in a natural state, they often look like a patchwork quilt of different forest communities. Western hemlock typically dominate oldgrowth rainforests, but contain sections of Douglas firs, redcedar, [[alder]], and even [[coast redwood]] forests on their southern extent, near the Oregon and California border, while [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]] increases in frequency with latitude.\n\nThe logging practices of the last 200 years created artificial disturbances that caused Douglas firs to thrive. The Douglas fir's useful wood and its quick growth make it the crop of choice for many timber companies, which typically replant a clear-cut area with Douglas fir seedlings. The high-light conditions that exist within a clear-cut also naturally favor the regeneration of Douglas fir. Because of clear-cut logging, almost all the Pacific Northwest forests not strictly set aside for protection are today dominated by Douglas fir, while the normally dominant climax species, such as western hemlock and western redcedar are less common. On drier sites in California, where Douglas fir behaves as a climax species in the absence of fire, the Douglas fir has become somewhat invasive following fire suppression practices of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries; it is becoming a dominant species in many [[oak]] [[California oak woodland|woodlands]], in which it was previously a minor component.<ref>C.

This resin-impregnated [[heartwood]] becomes hard and rot-resistant. The [[Tree stump|stump]] (and [[tap root]]) left in the ground after a tree has fallen or has been cut is an excellent source of fatwood. Other locations, such as the joints where limbs intersect the trunk, can also be harvested.  Although most resinous pines can produce fatwood, in the southeastern United States the wood is commonly associated with [[Pinus palustris|longleaf pine]] (''Pinus palustris''), which historically was highly valued for its high [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] production.\n\n==History==\nThe commercial use of fatwood from stumps stemmed from its use to make [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and [[pine tar]]. In 1648, a company was formed in [[Sweden]] called ''Norrl\u00e4ndska Tj\u00e4rkompaniet'' (The Wood Tar Company of North Sweden), and was given exclusive export rights[for pinetar - see separate topic- not fatwood] by the [[King of Sweden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritime.org/conf/conf-kaye-tar.htm |title=Pine Tar; History And Uses |publisher=Maritime.org |date=1997-07-07 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\nConiferous tree sap is a [[Viscosity|viscous]] [[liquid]], that contains [[terpene]], a [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[hydrocarbon]]. Over time the [[evaporation]] of the terpene changes the state of the sap; it slowly gets thicker until it hardens into [[resin]]. New fatwood leaks the sticky sap, while in aged fatwood the sap has hardened and is no longer sticky. At every stage of the aging process, fatwood will burn readily, even when wet.\n\n==Wood kindling and tinder==\nBecause of the flammability of terpene, fatwood is prized for use as kindling in starting fires. It lights quickly even when wet, is very wind resistant, and burns hot enough to light larger pieces of wood. A small piece of fatwood can be used many times to create tinder by shaving small curls and using them to light other larger tinder. In [[Louisiana]] \"fatwood\" is known as \"rich lighter\" and cut slivers are what is referred to as \"kindling\" because of the abundance{{clarification needed|date=December 2016}}. The pitch-soaked wood produces an oily, sooty smoke, and it is recommended{{by whom?|date=December 2016}} that one should not cook on a fire until all the fatwood has completely burned out.  The smoke produced by \"fatwood\" is considered{{by whom?|date=December 2016}} to be an excellent bug (especially [[mosquito]]) [[Insect repellent|repellent]] (although this is unproven).\n\n==Distribution==\nThere are between 105 and 125 [[species]] classified as [[resin]]ous [[Pine|pine trees]] around the world. Species usable for fatwood are distributed across a range including Eurasia, where they range from the Canary Islands, Iberian Peninsula and Scotland east to the Russian Far East. From the Philippines, Norway, Finland and Sweden (Scots Pine), and eastern Siberia (Siberian Dwarf Pine), and south to northernmost Africa. From the Himalaya and Southeast Asia, with one species (Sumatran Pine) just crossing the Equator in Sumatra,. In North America, they range from 66\u00b0N in Canada (Jack Pine), to [[Central America]] to 12\u00b0N in Nicaragua (Caribbean Pine). The highest diversity in the genus occurs in Mexico and California. In the sub-tropics of the Southern Hemisphere, including Chile, Brazil, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and New Zealand, where the trees are not [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] but were introduced. Anywhere there is a pine tree or pine [[Tree stump|stump]], there can be fatwood that can be found on top of the ground, but is more concentrated and preserved in stumps.\n\n===The United States===\nIn the United States the pine tree, ''[[Pinus palustris]]'', known as the Longleaf pine, once covered as much as  {{convert|90000000|acre|km2}} but due to [[clear cutting]] was reduced by between 95% and 97%. The trees grow very large (up to 150 feet), taking 100 to 150 years to mature and can live up to 500 years. The wood was prized and cutting resulted in many hundreds of thousands of stumps that are very resinous, do not rot, and eventually become fatwood. This ushered in a new industry for many years. There is still a market for the wood, but supplies are less abundant. Due to the length of growing time, the ''[[Pinus taeda]]'', also called the Loblolly pine, replaced it for commercial replanting, with a maturity of only 38 to 45 years.\n\n==Industrial uses==\nIndustrial uses for fatwood include production of [[turpentine]]; when fatwood is cooked down in a fire kiln, the heavier resin product that results is [[pine tar]]. The [[steam]] that vaporizes from this process is turned into a liquid that becomes turpentine.\n\n===Other uses===\nTree resins or by-products are used in many different things to include;\n*Household chemicals especially for cleaning such as turpentine and pine oil.\n*Nail polish\n*medical to include dental\n*Cutler's resin is still used in making knife handles.\n\n==See also==\n[[Sugartown, Louisiana]]\n[[Beauregard Parish, Louisiana]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{Commonscat}}\n* [http://www.napoleum.de/levb/LEVB%20Das%20Beleuchtungswesen.pdf Ladislaus E.v.

It is found in [[mesophytic]] [[hardwood]] [[forest]]s from [[Nova Scotia]] west to [[Minnesota]], south to northern [[Florida]], and southwest to eastern [[Texas]]. Isolated populations have also been found in western [[Texas]], [[Wyoming]] and [[Colorado]], and the species is reportedly naturalized in [[Hawaii]].<ref name=grin>{{GRIN|316687|Fraxinus americana}}</ref><ref>[http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id=369468 Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families,  ''Fraxinus americana'']</ref><ref>{{BONAP|ref|genus=Fraxinus|species=americana}}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe name White Ash derives from the [[glaucous]] undersides of the leaves. It is similar in appearance to the [[Green Ash]], making identification difficult. The lower sides of the leaves of White Ash are lighter in color than their upper sides, and the outer surface of the twigs of White Ash may be flaky or peeling. Green Ash leaves are similar in color on upper and lower sides, and twigs are smoother. Despite some overlap, the two species tend to grow in different locations as well; White Ash is a forest tree that commonly occurs alongside [[Sugar Maple]] while Green Ash is a [[pioneer species]] that inhabits [[riparian zones]] and disturbed areas.<ref name=ncp>Common Trees of the North Carolina Piedmont: [http://www.ibiblio.org/openkey/intkey/web/FRAM2.htm ''Fraxinus americana'']</ref><ref name=nb>New Brunswick tree and shrub: [http://scf.rncan.gc.ca/subsite/mx-212/whiteash ''Fraxinus americana'']</ref>\n\n[[File:2015-10-21 10 57 30 White Ash foliage during autumn along Pennington Road (New Jersey Route 31) in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|Autumn foliage]]\n\n== Cultivation and uses ==\n\nWhite ash is one of the most used trees for everyday purposes and, to keep up with high demand, is cultivated almost everywhere it can be. The wood is white and quite dense (within 20% of 670&nbsp;kg/m3),<ref name=\"White Ash\">[http://www.nichetimbers.co.uk/north-american-hardwood/ash/ White Ash], ''Niche Timbers''. Retrieved on 2009-07-24.</ref> strong, and straight-grained. It is the timber of choice for production of [[baseball bat]]s and tool handles. The wood is also favorable for furniture and [[Wood flooring|flooring]]. Woodworkers use the timber mainly for interior uses due to high perishability in contact with ground soil.<ref name=\"White Ash\" /> It is also used to make [[lobster trap]]s. Since the 1950s, it has also become a popular choice for solid [[electric guitar]] bodies.<ref name=\"Tech Talk: Ash and Alder\">[http://www2.fender.com/experience/tech-talk/tech-talk-ash-and-alder/]</ref> It makes a very servicable [[longbow]] if properly worked. The wood was used in ceiling fan blades from the 1970s through the mid-1980s, though cane was sometimes simulated with plastic then. It is no longer used for ceiling fan blades in most countries.\n\nWhite Ash is not seen in cultivation as often as Green Ash due to its preference for undisturbed forest sites away from urban pollution and soil compaction, but sometimes has been planted for its consistently reliably autumn colors, which typically are bright orange and red hues as opposed to other species of ash that produce a uniform yellow color.\n\nA related species, Biltmore Ash, is sometimes treated as a variety of White Ash. However, other taxonomists argue that Biltmore Ash is its own species (''Fraxinus biltmoreana'').<ref>Nesom, G.L.

University of North Carolina Herbarium, Chapel Hill, NC</ref>\n\n== Emerald ash borer ==\n{{Main|Emerald ash borer}}\nThe emerald ash borer (''Agrilus planipennis''), also commonly known by the [[acronym]] EAB, is a green [[beetle]] native to Asia.\n\nIn [[North America]] the [[emerald ash borer]] is an invasive species, highly destructive to ash trees in its introduced range. The damage of this insect rivals that of [[Chestnut blight]] and [[Dutch Elm Disease]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Bruce Schlink|title=Americans Held Hostage by the Environmentalist Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mkXBaIFpuAC&pg=PA494&lpg=PA4940|year=2012|publisher=Dorrance Publishing|page=494|isbn=978-1-4349-7536-2}}</ref> To put its damage in perspective, the number of [[chestnuts]] killed by the [[Chestnut blight]] was around 3.5 billion chestnut trees while there are 3.5 billion ash trees in [[Ohio]] alone. [[Dutch Elm Disease]] killed only 200 million elm trees while EAB threatens 7.5 billion ash trees in the United States. The insect threatens the entire North American genus ''Fraxinus'', while past invasive tree pests have only threatened a single species within a genus. Since its accidental introduction into the United States and Canada in the 1990s, and its subsequent detection in 2002, it has spread to eleven states and adjacent parts of Canada. It has killed at least 50 million ash trees so far and threatens to kill most of the ash trees throughout North America. The green ash and the black ash trees are affected. White ash is also killed rapidly, but usually only after green and black ash trees are eliminated. Blue ash displays some resistance to the emerald ash borer by forming callous tissue around EAB galleries; however, they are usually killed. White ash has been less affected by emerald ash borer due to its small population (unlike its cousin, ''F. americana'' is not commonly seen in cultivation) compared to green ash, which was planted in huge numbers as an ornamental.<ref>[http://joa.isa-arbor.com/request.asp?JournalID=1&ArticleID=3011&Type=2 Andrea C.

It is native to the [[southwestern United States]] and northern [[Mexico]], where it grows in a number of habitats including [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|desert scrub]] and [[chaparral]]. It is unusual in the genus in that some (though not all) specimens have simple leaves instead of the pinnate leaves more characteristic of the group.\n\n==Description==\n''Fraxinus anomala'' is a deciduous [[shrub]] or small tree approaching maximum heights of five to six meters. The leaf may be simple or it may be compound, composed of up to five leaflets which look like individual leaves. Each leaflet is oval-shaped to round and may have teeth along the edges. The nondescript brownish flowers lack petals. The fruit is a flat [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] up to two centimeters long and one wide, green when young and tan to brown when mature. The samaras hang in bunches.\n\n==Distribution==\nIn [[Arizona]], singleleaf ash is found along the [[Arizona transition zone]] of the [[Mogollon Rim]]. In northern Arizona's [[Grand Canyon]], the range extends down the main canyons from southern and southeastern [[Utah]], its major range area, where the [[Canyon Lands]] also show the range entering upper reaches of river basins flowing from western [[Colorado]] &ndash; [[Colorado River|Colorado]] and [[Dolores River]]s; also the shorter [[Yellowjacket River|Yellowjacket]] and [[McElmo River]]s in Colorado's extreme southwest.<ref>Little.

That epidemic was the result of a similar overuse of elms in urban environments, leading to a [[monoculture]] that lacked any disease or pest resistance. Scientifically for red ash this is because modern cultivars utilized regionally were parented from sometimes only four individual trees selected for unique traits and male seedless flowering. Proclaiming a harsh lesson learned, cities like Chicago did not replace dead elms with a 1:1 ash:elm ratio. Instead, Norway, silver, red and sugar maples, honey locust, linden/basswood, redbud, crabapples and hackberry, among others, were also utilized during this recovery period and in new urban and suburban areas. Fortunately, with these additional species, many cities were able to reduce the percent of ash and other species to much lower levels (20% average) than during the Dutch elm disease era where from 56% to 100% of the trees were elm.\n\nBoth American elm and green ash were extremely popular due to rapid growth and tolerance of urban pollution and road salt, so many housing developments in [[Michigan]] were lined from end to end with ashes, a result of which the beetles had an enormous food supply to boost their population well above Infestation thresholds. The tree was also extensively propagated and sold by local nurseries. According to the American Nursery Industry, \"Back in the late 1980s, Dr. Frank Santamour Jr., then a research geneticist with the U.S. National Arboretum, proposed the 10-20-30 formula for diversity in the urban forest, limiting the plantings in a community to no more than 10 percent within a single species, 20 percent within a genus and 30 percent within a family.\"\"\u00a0Because of EAB today, many communities  are using a more strict 20 -10-5 rule.\n\nThe emerald ash borer proved to be a far worse and potentially more serious threat than epidemics of the past such as chestnut blight and Dutch elm disease because those diseases spread at a slower rate, only affected one species, and did not kill the trees before they could attain reproductive maturity. Many areas have banned the sale of ash seedlings in nurseries, although seeds may be sold as they are not a vector for the insect.\n\n== Uses ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== Urban ornamental trees ===\n[[File:2014-10-29 13 12 58 Green Ash foliage during autumn coloration in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|thumb|right|Autumn leaf color]]\nGreen ash is one of the most widely planted [[ornamental plant|ornamental trees]] throughout the [[United States]] and much of [[Canada]] but mostly [[Alberta]], including in western areas where it is not native. It is also widely planted in [[Argentina]]. It is very popular due to its good form and resistance to disease.

Today used as living national monuments, the National Park Service is protecting [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s 200-year-old planted example, and [[George Washington]]'s 250-year-old [[white ash]] which has a 600-year possible lifespan.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Green ash had been widely used as a primary ornamental and long lived monument tree until the elm fad of the 1880s, and regained top position once again after [[Dutch elm disease]] arrived.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nOther continents learned of American ash species' urban survivability and unique beauty through the worldwide popularity of Midwestern Prairie style ecology and architectural movement. Modernizing cities in [[Russia]] and [[China]] then began using imported green ash a century ago to line streets and landscape new public parks.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} When one Chinese city's original collection, which had survived into late 1980's suddenly all died, city fathers used trees by sending them back to America as wooden crates containing Chinese made parts supplying the American auto industry.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Advantages of green ash include its tolerance of harsh urban environmental conditions, ease of propagation, and (in eastern North America) its value for wildlife as a native [[keystone species]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ash Tree Identification|url=http://www.nyis.info/?action=eab_ash_tree_identification|website=New York Invasive Species Information|publisher=Cornell University Cooperative Extension|accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\nGreen ash [[wood]] is similar in properties to [[Fraxinus americana|white ash]] wood, and is marketed together as \"white ash\". The commercial supply is mostly in the South. It is very popular, used in making [[electric guitar]]s because it can be somewhat lighter than white ash without sacrificing too much in tone. It has a bright sound with long sustain, plus the wood grain is aesthetically desirable to many guitar players. [[Gibson]], [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], [[Ibanez]], [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]], M2Guitars and many other [[luthier]]s use ash in the construction of their guitars.\n\n== References ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{Commons category|Fraxinus pennsylvanica}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Fraxinus|pennsylvanica]]\n[[Category:Trees of humid continental climate]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]\n[[Category:Trees of Western Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1785]]",

It grows up to {{convert|10|m|ft}} tall, rarely {{convert|15|m|ft}}, and provides [[erosion]] control and year-round shade for wildlife and [[livestock]].\n\nThe feathery foliage grows in dense sprays, bright green in color. The leaves are scale-like, {{convert|2|to|5|mm|in}} long, and produced on rounded (not flattened) shoots. It is a [[Plant sexuality|dioecious]] species, with separate male and female plants. The seed [[conifer cone|cones]] are round, {{convert|3|to|5|mm|in}} long, and soft, pulpy and [[Berry (botany)|berry]]-like, green at first, maturing purple about 8 months after pollination. They contain 1-2 [[seed]]s, which are dispersed when [[bird]]s eat the cones and pass the seeds in their droppings. The male cones are 3\u20135&nbsp;mm long, yellow, turning brown after [[pollen]] release in December to February.\n\n==Allergy==\n\nThe pollen causes a severe [[allergy|allergic]] reaction for some [[human|people]] in the winter, and people who are allergic to Ashe juniper are also often allergic to the related ''[[Juniperus virginiana]]''. Consequently, what begins as an allergy in the winter may extend into spring since the pollination of ''J. virginiana'' follows that of ''J. ashei''. Ashe juniper is sometimes known in the area as \"mountain cedar\" (although neither it nor ''J. virginiana'' are [[Cedrus|cedars]]), and locals usually refer to the allergy as [[cedar fever]].  Left untreated, symptoms of cedar fever may develop into a more severe infection such as [[pneumonia]].  The allergy itself seems to be most prevalent among transplant residents who resided in northeastern states for most of their lives, but can affect even locals who have resided there all their lives and are only now developing an allergy. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Uses==\n\nThe wood is naturally rot resistant and provides raw material for fence posts. Posts cut from old-growth Ashe junipers have been known to last in the ground for more than 50 years. Over one hundred years ago, most old-growth Ashe junipers were cut and used not only for fence posts, but also for telegraph poles and railroad ties.<ref>Bray, William L., 1904. Forest Resources of Texas, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Forestry, Bulletin No. 47. Government Printing Office: Washington D.C.</ref>\n\n==Texas==\n\nAlthough Ashe Juniper is native to central Texas, it is considered a weed by many landowners. Some believe that it captures large amounts of water, denying it to other plants, thus causing them to die out and allowing the Ashe Juniper to take over, although evidence for this is conflicting.  Developers who are improving land with little to no trees in an area, like on a rocky hillside above a lake, will set up an irrigation system that pumps water from the lake, sprays it out over the hillside where Ashe seedlings are, and whatever does not irrigate the trees will flow back into the lake.  Since with a constant water supply they are fast growing, this causes the land to quickly become \"more valuable\" due to its \"improved nature\" {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}.\n\n[[Ranchers]] also consider it to be a pest plant because [[overgrazing]] by [[cattle]] selectively removes competition when they avoid the bitter-tasting juniper seedlings.  This allows for a high rate of juniper establishment and reduces ranch yields.  Ashe juniper does not resprout when cut; but its cousin, the [[Juniperus pinchotii|redberry juniper]] does resprout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://texnat.tamu.edu/symposia/sculptor/9.htm |title=JUNIPER ECOLOGY |last=McGinty |first=Allan |date=18 March 1997 |publisher=unidentified |accessdate=2009-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416050513/http://texnat.tamu.edu/symposia/sculptor/9.htm |archivedate=16 April 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Overgrazed lands==\n\nThe junipers that establish in overgrazed lands are young and vigorous, dense and multi-trunked, and shallow rooted.  This makes it difficult for remaining grasses to compete for water, especially if they are still being grazed and the soils are impoverished.  The presence of these dense, shallow-rooted shrubs also means less water reaches the soil, subsurface flows and deep drainage.  However, their dense canopies and thick litter do reduce overland flows compared to grazed grasses.  Old-growth Ashe junipers are different in that they have true trunks, use less water, are slow growing, less foliated and have very deep roots.  Wilcox (Texas A&M University) and Keith Owens (Texas Ag. Ext. researcher at Uvalde) are currently studying how these deeper roots may facilitate the deep drainage of water down trunk stemflows.

The juvenile leaves are found on young plants up to 3 years old, and as scattered shoots on adult trees, usually in shade. The [[conifer cone|seed cones]] are {{convert|3|-|7|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} long, [[Berry (botany)|berry]]-like, dark purple-blue with a white wax cover giving an overall sky-blue color (though the wax often rubs off); they contain one to three (rarely up to four) [[seed]]s, and are mature in 6\u20138 months from pollination. The [[juniper berry]] is an important winter food for many [[bird]]s, which disperse the wingless seeds. The [[pollen]] cones are {{convert|2|-|3|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1.5|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} broad, shedding pollen in late winter or early spring. The trees are usually [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], with pollen and seed cones on separate trees.<ref name=farjon /><ref name=gd /><ref name=adams />\n\nThere are two varieties,<ref name=fna /> which intergrade where they meet:<ref name=farjon /><ref name=gd /><ref name=adams />\n*''Juniperus virginiana'' var. ''virginiana'' is called eastern juniper / redcedar. It is found in eastern North America, from [[Maine]], west to southern [[Ontario]] and [[South Dakota]], south to northernmost [[Florida]] and southwest into the post oak savannah of east-central [[Texas]]. Cones are larger, {{convert|4|\u2013|7|mm|frac=16|abbr=on}}; scale leaves are acute at apex and bark is red-brown.\n*''Juniperus virginiana'' var. ''silicicola'' (Small) E.Murray (syn. ''Sabina silicicola'' Small, ''Juniperus silicicola'' (Small) L.H.Bailey) is known as southern or sand juniper / redcedar. Habitat is along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from the extreme Southeastern corner of [[Virginia]],<ref>http://www.dof.virginia.gov/infopubs/_outside-pubs/USDA-FS-SRS-155_outpub.pdf</ref> south to central [[Florida]] and west to southeast [[Texas]]. Cones are smaller, {{convert|3|\u2013|4|mm|frac=16|abbr=on}}; scale leaves are blunt at apex and the bark is orange-brown. It is treated by some authors at the lower rank of variety, while others treat it as a distinct species.\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Juniperus virginiana near Oxford, Ohio.jpg|left|thumb|Characteristic shape in old field succession]]\nEastern juniper is a [[pioneer species]], which means that it is one of the first trees to repopulate cleared, eroded, or otherwise damaged land.  It is unusually long lived among pioneer species, with the potential to live over 900 years. It is commonly found in [[prairie]]s or oak barrens, old pastures, or [[limestone]] hills, often along highways and near recent construction sites.<ref name=farjon /><ref name=gd /><ref name=\"NW-Barlow\" /> It is an alternate host for [[Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae|cedar\u2013apple rust]], an economically significant [[fungal disease]] of apples, and some management strategies recommend the removal of ''J. virginiana'' near apple orchards<ref name=wvu>[[West Virginia University]]: [http://www.caf.wvu.edu/kearneysville/disease_descriptions/omcar.html Cedar-Apple Rust, ''Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae'']</ref>\n\nIn many areas it is considered an [[invasive species]], even if native. It is [[fire-intolerant]], and was previously controlled by periodic [[wildfire]]s. Low branches near the ground burn and provide a ladder that allows fire to engulf the whole tree. Grasses recover quickly from low severity fires that are characteristic of prairies that kept the trees at bay. With the urbanization of prairies, the fires have been stopped with roads, plowed fields, and other fire breaks, allowing ''J. virginiana'' and other trees to invade.<ref>[http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/marktwain/projects/forest_plan/86_plan/Appendix_E.pdf Forest Plan]</ref> Trees are destructive to grasslands if left unchecked, and are actively being eliminated by cutting and [[prescribed burning]].<ref>Noble Foundation: [http://www.noble.org/Press_Release/Ag/EasternRedCedar/ArbuckleRestoration.html News Release]</ref> The trees also burn very readily, and dense populations were blamed for the rapid spread of wildfires in drought stricken [[Oklahoma]] and [[Texas]] in 2005 and 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0601/01/bn.02.html|title=Wildfires Rip Through Oklahoma|agency=[[CNN]]|date=January 1, 2006|accessdate=April 11, 2007}}</ref>\n\nEastern juniper benefits from increased [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] levels, unlike the grasses with which it competes.  Many grasses are [[C4 carbon fixation|C4 plants]] that concentrate CO<sub>2</sub> levels in their bundle sheaths to increase the efficiency of [[RuBisCO]], the enzyme responsible for [[photosynthesis]], while junipers are [[C3 carbon fixation|C3 plants]] that rely on (and may benefit from) the natural CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of the environment, although they are less efficient at fixing CO<sub>2</sub> in general.<ref>McKinley, Duncan C., and John M. Blair. \"Woody Plant Encroachment by ''Juniperus virginiana'' in a Mesic Native Grassland Promotes Rapid Carbon and Nitrogen Accrual.\" Ecosystems 11.3 (Apr. 2008): 454-468.</ref>\n\nDamage done by ''J. virginiana'' includes outcompeting forage species in pastureland. The low branches and wide base occupy a significant portion of land area.  The thick foliage blocks out most light, so few plants can live under the canopy. The needles that fall raise the [[Soil pH|pH of the soil]], making it [[alkali]]ne, which holds nutrients such as phosphorus, making it harder for plants to absorb them.  ''Juniperus virginiana'' has been shown to remove [[nitrogen]] from the soil after invading prairies.<ref>Norris, Mark D., John M. Blair, and Loretta C. Johnson. \"Altered Ecosystem Nitrogen Dynamics as a Consequence of Land Cover Change in Tallgrass Prairie.\" American Midland Naturalist 158.2 (Oct. 2007): 432-445.</ref> It has also been found to reduce carbon stores in the soil.  This reduction in soil nutrients also reduces the amount and diversity of microbial activity in the soil.<ref>McKinley, Duncan C., and John M.

It takes about 12 minutes for their seeds to pass through the birds' guts, and seeds that have been consumed by this bird have levels of germination roughly three times higher than those of seeds the birds did not eat.

They thrive under adverse conditions \u2013 both drought tolerant and cold tolerant, they grow well in rocky, sandy, and clay substrates. Competition between trees is minimal, so they can be planted in tightly spaced rows, and the trees still grow to full height, creating a solid windbreak in a short time.<ref>[http://hort.ufl.edu/trees/JUNVIRA.pdf USDA Fact Sheet]</ref>\n\nA number of [[cultivar]]s have been selected for garden planting, including 'Canaertii' (narrow conical; female) 'Corcorcor' (with a dense, erect crown; female), 'Goldspire' (narrow conical with yellow foliage), and 'Kobold' (dwarf). Some cultivars previously listed under this species, notably 'Skyrocket', are actually cultivars of ''J. scopulorum''.<ref>Welch, H., & Haddow, G. (1993). ''The World Checklist of Conifers''. Landsman's. ISBN 0-900513-09-8.</ref>\n\nIn the Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas Ozarks, eastern juniper is commonly used as a [[Christmas tree]].\n\n== Allergen ==\nThe pollen is a known [[allergen]], although not as potent as that of the related ''[[Juniperus ashei]]'' (Ashe juniper), which sheds pollen a month earlier. People allergic to one are usually allergic to both. ''J. virginiana'' sheds pollen as early as late winter and through early spring. Consequently, what begins as an allergy to Ashe juniper in the winter may extend into spring, since the pollination of the eastern juniper follows that of the Ashe juniper.\n\nContact with the leaves or wood can produce a mild skin rash in some individuals.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Cedar wood]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikispecies}}\n* [http://www.pollenlibrary.com/index.php?view=species.php&state=&county=&genus=Juniperus&common=Eastern%20Red-Cedar&species=Juniperus%20virginiana PollenLibrary.com \u2013 Red Cedar distribution map and allergen information]\n* [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_1/juniperus/virginiana.htm USDA Forest Service: Silvics of Trees of North America: ''Juniperus virginiana'']<!--\nRef: {{Silvics |volume=1 |genus=Juniperus |species=virginiana |first=Edwin R. |last=Lawson }} -->\n\n*[http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/juniperus-virginiana-eastern-redcedar-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map of ''Juniperus virginiana'']\n{{Commons category|position=left}}\n\n\n{{Cupressaceae}}\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Juniperus|virginiana]]\n[[Category:Dioecious plants]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Plains-Midwest (United States)]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Plants used in bonsai]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

Its [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''styraciflua'' is an old generic name meaning \"flowing with storax\" (a plant resin).<ref name=Grimm /> The name \"[[storax balsam|storax]]\" has long been confusingly applied to the aromatic gum or resin of this species, that of ''[[Liquidambar orientalis|L.&nbsp;orientalis]]'' of [[Turkey]], and to the resin better known as [[benzoin resin|benzoin]] from various tropical trees in the genus ''[[Styrax]]''.\n\nThe sweetgum has a [[Nahuatl]] name, ''Ocotzocuahuitl'', which translates to ''tree that gives pine resin'' from ''ocotl'' (pine), ''tzotl'' (resin), ''cuahuitl'' (tree), which refers to the use of the tree's resin.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7qgPCEiI4WMC&pg|title=Florida Ethnobotany|last=Austin|first=Daniel F.|date=2004-11-29|publisher=CRC Press|year=2004|isbn=9780203491881|location=|pages=407|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe common name \"sweet gum\" refers to the species' \"sweetish gum\",<ref name=Werthner>{{cite book|last=Werthner|first=William B.|title=Some American Trees:  An intimate study of native Ohio trees|year=1935|publisher=The Macmillan Company|location=New York|pages=xviii + 398 pp.}}</ref> contrasting with the [[Nyssa sylvatica|black gum ''(Nyssa sylvatica)'']], only distantly related, with which the sweet gum overlaps broadly in range.

In Ray's ''Historia Plantarum'' (1686) it is called ''Styrax liquida''. However, the first mention of any use of the amber is described by Juan de Grijalva, the nephew of the Govorner of Cuba, in the year 1517.\nJuan de Grijalva tells of gift exchanges with the Mayas \"who presented them with, among other things, hollow reeds of about a span long filled with dried herbs and sweet-smelling liquid amber which, when lighted in the way shown by the natives, diffused an agreeable odour.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Corti|first1=Count|title=A History of Smoking|date=1931|publisher=George G.

The species also occurs in [[Mexico]] from southern [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]] south to [[Chiapas]], as well as in [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]] and also in southern [[Brazil]].

Limber and Cash reported that leaf spots produced by this pathogen on several different genera of forest trees were 2\u20135&nbsp;mm diameter with regular margins. During the summer of 1994 in the Nacogdoches County area of Texas, a prominent leaf spot on Sweet Gum was widespread. Infected leaves had numerous necrotic lesions, each surrounded by a reddish halo. The lesions tended to merge resulting in large areas of dead tissue. Infection and fungal development of ''D.&nbsp;dryina'' were investigated on leaves of sweet gum using a combination of microscopic techniques. ''D.&nbsp;dryina'' infection on Sweet Gum has been associated with the disease red leaf spot. Results of this investigation indicate that ''D.&nbsp;dryina'' can penetrate leaf tissue directly, thus having the ability to initiate infection on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. In other regions of the U.S., Sweet Gum populations may not be as susceptible to local populations of this fungus. Environmental stress factors may also be involved, as reports have indicated that herbicide application and [[chlorosis]] caused by iron deficiency may increase susceptibility of ''[[Dicarpella dryina]]''. [[Tannin]]s (a type of biomolecule found in trees to protect it from fire, insects, and bacteria) have been reported to occur in healthy tissue of a variety of plants including sweet gum. They may prevent pathogen invasion by inhibiting fungal enzyme activity. Although cells of healthy sweet gum tissue appear rich in tannins, these materials apparently were not effective in preventing fungal colonization by ''D.&nbsp;dryina''.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Josephine|author2=Shane Clark |title=Infection and Fungal Development of ''Dicarpella dryina'' on Sweet Gum (''Liquidambar styraciflua'')|journal=Mycologia|date=July\u2013August 1996|volume=88|series=Search Wise|issue=4|pages=613\u2013618|<!-- accessdate=17 September 2012 -->|doi=10.2307/3761156}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n* {{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Liquidambar |species=styraciflua }}\n* {{eFloras|1|220007687|Liquidambar styraciflua}}\n{{1728}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|Liquidambar styraciflua}}{{wikispecies}}\n* {{PLANTS |symbol=LIQUI |name=Liquidambar styraciflua}}\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/liquidambar-styraciflua-sweetgum-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map for ''Liquidambar styraciflua'']\n* [http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Liquidambar+styraciflua University of Michigan - Dearborn: Native American Ethnobotany of  ''Liquidambar styraciflua'']\n* [http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/data/atlas/little/liqustyr.pdf USGS Species Distribution Maps: ''Liquidambar styraciflua''] (pdf file).\n* [http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/list2.htm Bioimages.vanderbilt.edu: ''Liquidambar styraciflua'' images]\n* [http://landscaping.about.com/od/fallfoliagetrees/p/sweetgum_trees.htm Landscaping.about.com: American Sweetgum Trees]\n* {{IUCN2006|assessor=Americas Regional Workshop (Conservation|assessor2=Sustainable Management of Trees, Costa Rica, November 1996)|last-assessor-amp=yes|year=1998|id=33966|title=Liquidambar styraciflua|downloaded=12 May 2006}}\n <!-- Most of Florida, as opposed to the continental trees of \"Trees of Northern Florida\" -->\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Altingiaceae]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Southern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of Belize]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Trees of Honduras]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Trees of Chiapas]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Hidalgo (state)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puebla]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Veracruz]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Least concern plants]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

The specific epithet ''pomifera'' means \"fruit-bearing\".<ref name=USDA_FS/> The common name ''Osage'' derives from [[Osage Nation|Osage Native Americans]] from whom young plants were first obtained, as told in the notes of Meriwether Lewis in 1804.<ref name=smith/>\n\n== Description ==\n\n===General habit===\nMature trees range from {{convert|40|to(-)|60|ft|m|disp=flip}} tall with short trunks and round-topped canopies. The roots are thick, fleshy, and covered with bright orange bark. The tree's mature bark is dark, deeply furrowed and scaly.\n\nThe wood of ''M. pomifera'' is bright orange-yellow with paler yellow sapwood. The wood is heavy, hard, strong, and flexible, capable of receiving a fine polish and very durable in contact with the ground. It has a [[specific gravity]] of 0.7736, or {{convert|773.6|kg/m3|lb/ft3|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Leaves and branches===\nLeaves are [[leaf arrangement|arranged alternately]] in a slender growing shoot {{convert|3|to(-)|4|ft|cm|-1|disp=flip}} long. In form they are [[simple leaf|simple]], a long oval terminating in a slender point. The leaves are {{convert|3|to(-)|5|in|cm|0|disp=flip}} long and {{convert|2|to(-)|3|in|cm|0|disp=flip}} wide, and are thick, firm, dark green, shining above, and paler green below when full grown. In autumn they turn bright yellow. The [[leaf axil]]s contain formidable spines which when mature are about {{convert|1|in|cm|disp=flip}} long.\n\nBranchlets are at first bright green and pubescent; during their first winter they become light brown tinged with orange, and later they become a paler orange brown. Branches contain a yellow pith, and are armed with stout, straight, axillary spines. During the winter, the branches bear lateral buds that are depressed-globular, partly immersed in the bark, and pale chestnut brown in color.\n\n===Flowers and fruit===\nAs a [[Dioecy#In botany|dioecious]] plant, the inconspicuous [[pistillate]] (female) and [[staminate]] (male) flowers are found on different trees. Staminate flowers are pale green, small, and arranged in [[raceme]]s borne on long, slender, drooping [[peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]s developed from the axils of crowded leaves on the spur-like branchlets of the previous year. They feature a hairy, four-lobed [[sepal|calyx]]; the four stamens are inserted opposite the lobes of calyx, on the margin of a thin disk. Pistillate flowers are borne in a dense spherical many-flowered head which appears on a short stout peduncle from the axils of the current year's growth. Each flower has a hairy four-lobed calyx with thick, concave lobes that invest the ovary and enclose the fruit. [[Ovary (botany)|Ovaries]] are [[Ovary (botany)#Superior ovary|superior]], ovate, compressed, green, and crowned by a long slender [[style (botany)|style]] covered with white stigmatic hairs. The [[ovule]] is solitary.\n\nThe mature multiple fruit's size and general appearance resembles a large, yellow-green [[orange (fruit)|orange]], {{convert|4|to(-)|5|in|cm|disp=flip}} in diameter, with a roughened and tuberculated surface. The compound fruit is a [[syncarp]] of numerous small [[drupe]]s, in which the [[carpel]]s (ovaries) have grown together. Each small drupe is oblong, compressed and rounded; they contain a milky juice which oozes when the fruit is damaged or cut. The seeds are oblong. Although the flowering is dioecious, the pistillate tree when isolated will still bear large oranges, perfect to the sight but lacking the seeds.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book |last=Keeler |first=Harriet L. |title=Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them |url=https://archive.org/stream/ournativetreesa00keelgoog#page/n300/mode/2up |publisher=Charles Scriber's Sons |year=1900 |location=New York |pages=258\u2013262}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nImage:Maclura pomifera 001.JPG|<center>Mature tree\nImage:Maclura pomifera 008.jpg|<center>Mature bark\nImage:Maclura pomifera 002.JPG|<center>Leaves\nImage:Maclura pomifera 003.JPG|<center>Female inflorescence\nImage:Osage orange 1.jpg|<center>Mature multiple fruit\nImage:Osage orange 2.jpg|<center>Multiple fruit, sliced\n</gallery>\n\n== Distribution ==\n[[File:Maclura pomifera range map.png|thumb|right|Natural range of ''M. pomifera'' in pre-Columbian era America.]]\nOsage orange's pre-Columbian range was largely restricted to the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] drainage of [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], and [[Arkansas]], as well as the [[Texas blackland prairies|Blackland Prairies]] and [[Oak savanna|Post Oak Savannas]].

Grown for its attractive, shiny green leaves and fragrant flowers, it has a long history in the southern United States. Many large and very old specimens found in the subtropical port cities such as New Orleans, Mobile, Savannah, Charleston, and Wilmington, NC. ''M. grandiflora'' is the state tree of Mississippi and the state flower of Louisiana.\n\nThe species is also cultivated in the warmer parts of the United States; On the East Coast, a small number of specimens can be found growing as far north as coastal areas of New Jersey, Connecticut, and Long Island, NY. Farther south, it is grown more widely in Delaware, much of the Chesapeake Bay region in Maryland, and much of eastern Virginia. On the West Coast, it can be grown as far north as British Columbia/Seattle area, though cooler summers on the West Coast slow growth compared to the East Coast.<ref name=Call99/>\n\nIn the interior of the US, some of the cold-hardy [[cultivars]] have survived north to the southern Ohio Valley (Ohio, Kentucky, southern Indiana). Farther north, few known long term specimens are found due to the severe winters, very cold temperatures, and/or lack of sufficient summer heat.\n\n''Magnolia grandiflora'' is also grown in parts of Mexico, Central America, and South America as well as parts of Asia.<ref name=Call99/>\n\nIt is recommended for seashore plantings in areas that are windy but have little salt spray.<ref name=\"Americas_garden_book_a01\">{{Cite book  | last1 = Bush-Brown | first1 = Louise Carter | last2 = Bush-Brown | first2 = James | last3 = Irwin | first3 = Howard S. | title = America's garden book | year = 1996 | publisher = Macmillan USA | location = New York  | isbn = 0-02-860995-6 | pages = 537 }}</ref> The foliage will bronze, blotch, and burn in severe winters at the northern limits of cultivation, especially when grown in full winter sun,<ref name=\"native_trees_for_north_american_landscapes\"/> but most leaves remain until they are replaced by new [[foliage]] in the spring.

The name \"tupelo\" is used primarily in the [[Southern United States|American South]]; northward and in [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachia]], the tree is more commonly called the '''black gum''' or the '''sour gum''', although no part of the plant is particularly gummy.<ref name=Werthner /> Both of these names contrast it with a different tree species with a broadly overlapping range, the [[Liquidambar styraciflua|sweet gum ''(Liquidambar styraciflua)'']], which does produce an aromatic resin.<ref name=Werthner />  Another common name used occasionally in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] is ''pepperidge.''<ref name=Werthner />\n\nOn [[Martha's Vineyard]], in [[Massachusetts]], this species is called \"beetlebung\", perhaps for its use in making the mallet known as a beetle, used for hammering [[bung]]s (stoppers) into barrels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://extension.psu.edu/natural-resources/forests/news/2014/why-do-they-call-it-a-gum-tree| author=Paxton, William C. |date=2014|title=Why Do They Call It a Gum Tree?|publisher=Penn State Extension|accessdate=2014-09-14}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n<!---Overlapping parallel descriptions text should be integrated--->\n[[Image:Nyssa sylvatica JPG1b.jpg|right|thumb|''Nyssa sylvatica'' leaves in the autumn.]]\n[[File:NyssaSylvaticaTrunk.jpg|thumb|right|Trunk of a mature ''Nyssa sylvatica'' tree]]\n''Nyssa sylvatica'' grows to {{convert|20|-|25|m|ft}} tall, rarely to {{convert|35|m|ft}}, with a trunk diameter of {{convert|50|-|100|cm|in}}, rarely up to {{convert|170|cm|in}}. These trees typically have a straight trunk with the branches extending outward at right angles.<ref name=Werthner />  The [[bark]] is dark gray and flaky when young, but it becomes furrowed with age, resembling [[alligator]] hide on very old stems. The twigs of this tree are reddish-brown, usually hidden by a greyish skin. The pith is chambered with greenish partitions.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] of this species are variable in size and shape. They can be oval, elliptical, or obovate, and {{convert|5|\u2013|12|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long. They have lustrous upper surfaces, with entire, often wavy margins. The foliage turns purple in autumn, eventually becoming an intense bright scarlet. Deer are extremely fond of the leaves on seedlings and saplings, to the point where large populations of them can make establishment of the tree almost impossible. For comparison, mature trees are largely left alone.\n\nThe [[flower]]s are very small, in greenish-white in clusters at the top of a long stalk and a rich source or nectar for bees. They are often [[dioecious]] so a male and female tree in proximity is required to set seed, however, many trees are also [[Polygamo-dioecious#Polygamous|polygamo-dioecious]], which means they have both male and female flowers on the same tree. The [[fruit]] is a black-blue, ovoid stone fruit, about 10&nbsp;mm long with a thin, oily, bitter-to-sour tasting flesh and very popular with small bird species. There are from one to three fruits together on a long slender stalk. They are a valuable energy food for birds, especially the [[American robin]].\n\n''Nyssa sylvatica'' forms a large deep taproot when young that makes transplanting difficult. Because of this, it is fairly uncommon in cultivation and the nursery trade.\n\nAdditional characteristics include:\n* Bark: Light reddish brown, deeply furrowed and scaly. Branchlets at first pale green to orange, sometimes smooth, often downy, later dark brown.\n* Wood: Pale yellow, sapwood white; heavy, strong, very tough, hard to split, not durable in contact with the soil. Used for turnery. Sp. gr., 0.6353; weight of cu. ft., 39.59.\n* Winter buds: Dark red, obtuse, one-fourth of an inch long. Inner scales enlarge with the growing shoot, becoming red before they fall.\n* Leaves: Alternate, often crowded at the end of the lateral branches, simple, linear, oblong to oval, two to five inches (127&nbsp;mm)  long, one-half to three inches (76&nbsp;mm)  broad, wedge-shaped or rounded at base, entire, with margin slightly thickened, acute or acuminate. They come out of the bud conduplicate, coated beneath with rusty tomentum, when full grown are thick, dark green, very shining above, pale and often hairy beneath. Feather-veined, midrib and primary veins prominent beneath. In autumn they turn bright scarlet, or yellow and scarlet. Petioles one-quarter to one-half an inch long, slender or stout, terete or margined, often red.\n* Flowers: May, June, when leaves are half grown. Polygamodi\u0153cious, yellowish green, borne on slender downy peduncles. Staminate in many-flowered heads; pistillate in two to several flowered clusters.\n* Calyx: Cup-shaped, five-toothed.\n* Corolla: Petals five, imbricate in bud, yellow green, ovate, thick, slightly spreading, inserted on the margin of the conspicuous disk.\n* Stamens: Five to twelve. In staminate flowers exserted, in pistillate short, often wanting.\n* Pistil: Ovary inferior, one to two-celled; style stout, exserted, reflexed above the middle. Entirely wanting in sterile flower. Ovules, one in each cell.\n* Fruit: Fleshy drupe, one to three from each flower cluster. Ovoid, two-thirds of an inch long, dark blue, acid. Stone more or less ridged.

Its flowers are an important source of [[honey]] and its [[fruit]]s are important to many [[bird]] species. Hollow trunks provide nesting or denning opportunities for [[bee]]s and various [[mammals]]. It is the longest living non-clonal flowering plant in Eastern North America, capable of obtaining ages of over 650 years.<ref>http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~adk/oldlisteast/#spp Eastern OLDLIST</ref>\n\n===Habitats===\n''Nyssa sylvatica'' is found in a wide range of climates, due to its extensive distribution. It commonly grows in both the creek bottoms of the southern coastal plains, to altitudes of about {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in the [[Appalachian Mountains|Southern Appalachians]].<!---Elevation range in Mexico?--->  These trees grow best on well-drained, light-textured soils on the low ridges of second bottoms and on the high flats of silty alluvium. In the uplands it grows best on the loams and clay loams of lower slopes and coves.\n\nThe species occurs 35 different forest cover types.<ref name=\"Black Tupelo\"/> When found on drier upper slopes and ridges, it is seldom of log size or quality.<ref name=\"Black Tupelo\"/><!---But of log size in richer habitats?--->\n\n===Wildlife===\n[[Image:Nyssa sylvatica with mature fruit.jpg|right|thumb|''Nyssa sylvatica'' with mature fruit, starting to show fall coloring]]\n''Nyssa sylvatica'' is an important food source for many migrating birds in the fall. Its early color change ([[foliar fruit flagging]]) is thought to attract birds to the available fruit, which ripen before many other fall fruits and berries. The fruit is quite marked, dark blue, in clusters of two or three. The sour fruits are eagerly sought by many kinds of birds, including: [[American robin]], [[Swainson's thrush]], [[gray-cheeked thrush]], [[hermit thrush]], [[wood thrush]], [[northern cardinal]], [[northern mockingbird]], [[blue jay]], [[red-bellied woodpecker]], [[yellow-bellied sapsucker]], [[northern flicker]], [[pileated woodpecker]], [[eastern phoebe]], [[brown thrasher]], [[eastern bluebird]], [[European starling]], [[scarlet tanager]], [[gray catbird]], [[cedar waxwing]], and [[American crow]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} all primarily eastern North American birds migrating or residing year-round within the tree's range.\n\nThe limbs of these trees often deteriorate early, and the decayed holes make excellent dens for [[squirrel]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[Virginia opossum]]s, as well as nesting sites for [[honeybee]]s.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:2014-11-02 12 47 05 Black Tupelo during autumn at The College of New Jersey in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|right|thumb|''Nyssa sylvatica'' turning scarlet in autumn]]\n\n===Cultivation===\n''Nyssa sylvatica''  is cultivated as an [[ornamental tree]] in parks and large gardens, where it is often used as a specimen or shade tree. The tree is best when grown in sheltered but not crowded positions, developing a pyramidal shape in youth, and spreading with age. The stem rises to the summit of the tree in one tapering unbroken shaft, the branches come out at right angles to the trunk and either extend horizontally or droop a little, making a long-narrow, cone-like head.\n\nThe leaves are short-petioled and so have little individual motion, but the branches sway as a whole. The spray is fine and abundant and lies horizontally so that the foliage arrangement is not unlike that of the [[beech]] ''(Fagus)''. Its often spectacular autumnal coloring, with intense reds to purples, is highly valued in landscape settings. It is the most fiery and brilliant of the 'brilliant group' that includes [[Acer (genus)|maple]], [[Cornus (plant)|dogwood]], [[sassafras]], and [[Liquidambar|sweet gum]], as well as various species of [[tupelo]].<ref name=Keeler />\n\n===Honey production===\n''Nyssa sylvatica'' is a major source of wild honey in many areas within its range. Hollow sections of black gum trunks were formerly used as [[Beehive|bee gums]] by [[beekeeper]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Crane, Ethel Eva|title=The World History of Beekeeping and Honey Hunting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVh3AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA305|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=305}}</ref>\n\n===Wood===\nThe wood of ''Nyssa sylvatica'' is heavy, hard, cross-grained, and difficult to split, especially after drying. This resistance to splitting led to its use for making [[mallet|maul]]s, [[pulley]]s, [[wheel|wheel hub]]s, [[roller (agricultural tool)|agricultural roller]]s, [[bowl (vessel)|bowl]]s, and [[road surface|paving blocks]].<ref name=Werthner />  The wood is also used for pallets, rough floors, pulpwood, and firewood. Since the wood is very tough, resistant to wear, it has been used for [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttles]] in weaving.\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Nyssa sylvatica}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n* [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=NYSY USDA Plant Profile - ''Nyssa sylvatica'']\n* {{ThePlantList}}\n* [http://www.fw.vt.edu/dendro/dendrology/syllabus/nsylvatica.htm Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Source]\n* [http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hcs/TMI/Plantlist/ny_atica.html Ohio State University Source]\n* [http://www.hrt.msu.edu/ash.alt/tupelo.htm Michigan State University Source]\n* [http://www.hort.net/profile/nys/nyssy/ Hort.net profile]\n* [http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/nysy.htm ''Nyssa sylvatica'' images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu]\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/nyssa-sylvatica-black-tupelo-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map for Nyssa sylvatica]\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nyssa Sylvatica}}\n[[Category:Nyssa]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Hidalgo (state)]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puebla]]\n[[Category:Trees of Veracruz]]\n[[Category:Trees of Chiapas]]\n[[Category:Trees of humid continental climate]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

The [[leaf|leaves]] and stems are [[trichome|hairless]]. The leaves are alternate and pennate (15 to 20&nbsp;cm long). The flattened [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] is edged by two rows of 25\u201330 tiny oval leaflets; the leaflets are soon [[deciduous]] in dry weather (and during the winter in some areas) leaving the green petioles and branches to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]].\n\nThe branches grow double or triple sharp [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spines]] {{convert|7|-|12|mm|in|abbr=on}} long at the axils of the leaves. The [[flower]]s are yellow- orange and fragrant, {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, growing from a long slender stalk in groups of eight to ten. They have  five sepals and five petals, four of them clearer and rhomboid ovate, the fifth elongated, with a warmer yellow and purple spots at the base. The flowering period is the middle months of  spring(March& April or September & October). The flowers are pollinated by bees. The [[fruit]] is a [[legume|seedpod]], leathery in appearance, light brown when mature.\n\n==Invasive problems==\n''P. aculeata'' is a major [[invasive species]] in [[Australia]], parts of tropical [[Africa]], [[Hawaii]], and other [[Pacific islands|Islands]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]].\n\nIt was introduced to Australia as an [[ornamental tree]] and for shade around 1900. It is now a serious [[Invasive species in Australia|weed]] widespread through [[Western Australia]], the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Queensland]], covering about {{convert|8000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land, and has the potential to spread through most of the [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] to subhumid tropical area in Australia.\n\nIt forms dense [[thicket]]s, preventing access for humans, native animals and [[livestock]] to waterways. The fruits (seedpods) float, and the plant spreads by dropping pods into water, or pods are washed downstream by seasonal [[flood]]ing.  Without the scarifying received by tumbling in streambeds, the seeds are slow to germinate.\n\nSeveral control methods are used to reduce the existing population and the spread of ''P. aculeata'' in Australia. Three [[insect]]s have been [[Introduced species|introduced]] to Australia for [[biological control]]; the parkinsonia [[bean weevil]]s, ''Penthobruchus germaini'' and ''Mimosestes ulkei'', both have [[larva]]e that specifically eat the seeds from parkinsonia pods and are proving to be a useful management tool, and the parkinsonia leaf bug, ''Rhinacloa callicrates'', which destroys [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] tissues but has had little overall impact on the plant. Fire is effective for young trees; mechanical removal and [[herbicide]]s are also used.\n\n==Distribution==\n''P. aculeata'' is native to the Sonoran and Chihuahan Deserts of [[southwestern United States]] (western [[Texas]], southern [[New Mexico]] southern [[Arizona]]), and northern [[Mexico]] ([[Sonora]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]) as well as the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]]. Its native range has expanded over the last several decades into the ([[Edwards Plateau]] and [[Central Texas]]).  It has been moved by humans into the [[Caribbean]], [[South America]] south to northern [[Argentina]], and Hawai'i.  It has been introduced in [[Europe]] and it is widespread in [[Australia]].<ref name=\"GRIN\"/>  This thin barked species does not become established in areas where weather dips below 20 degrees F.  It has expanded into Southern California as far north as San Bernardino County.\n\n==Habitat==\n''Parkinsonia aculeata'' has a high tolerance to drought, simply attaining shorter stature. In moist and humus-rich environments it becomes a taller, spreading shade tree.  This plant prefers a full sun exposure, but can grow on a wide range of dry soils (sand dunes, clay, alkaline and chalky soils,etc.), at an altitude of {{convert|0|-|1500|m}} above sea level.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n\nFile:Caesalpiniaceae - Parkinsonia aculeata-4.JPG|Shrub of ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\nFile:Caesalpiniaceae - Parkinsonia aculeata-1.JPG|Leaflets of ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\nFile:Caesalpiniaceae - Parkinsonia aculeata-2.JPG|Leaflets of ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\nFile:Caesalpiniaceae - Parkinsonia aculeata-3.JPG|Thorns on ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\nFile:Parkinsonia aculeata 3.jpg|Plant of ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\nFile:Parkinsonia aculeata flowers 3.jpg|Flowers of ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*Cooperative Centre for Weed Management.

They can be eaten fresh or used in cooking, particularly in sweet desserts. One of the most common desserts with the pecan as a central ingredient is the [[pecan pie]], a traditional [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|Southern U.S. dish]].

Outside the United States, pecans are grown in [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], and [[South Africa]]. They can be grown from [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[hardiness zones]] approximately 5 to 9, provided summers are also hot and humid.\n\nPecan trees may live and bear edible seeds for more than 300 years. They are mostly [[self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatible]], because most [[cultivars]] are clones derived from wild trees which show incomplete [[Sequential hermaphroditism#Flowering plants|dichogamy]]. Generally, two or more trees of different cultivars must be present to pollinate each other.{{clear|left}}\n\nChoosing cultivars can be a complex practice, based on the Alternate Bearing Index (ABI) and their period of pollinating.  Commercial planters are most concerned with the ABI, which describes a cultivar's likelihood to bear on  alternating years (index of 1.0 signifies highest likelihood of bearing little to nothing every other year).<ref name=\"Alternate Bearing Information\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpes.peachnet.edu/pecan/alternate%20bearing.htm |title=University of Georgia Pecan Breeding |publisher=Cpes.peachnet.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>  The period of pollination groups all cultivars into two families: those that shed pollen before they can receive pollen ([[protandrous]]), and those that shed pollen after becoming receptive to pollen ([[protogynous]]).<ref name=\"GROWING PECANS\">\n\nPecans are also grown in the Central Valley of California\nIN ILLINOIS\">{{cite web|url=http://web.extension.uiuc.edu/edwardsvillecenter/downloads/11263.doc |title=William Reid, Nut Crops Extension Specialist, University of Illinois |date= |accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>  Planting cultivars from both families within 250 feet is recommended for proper pollination.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:pecan-nuts-on-tree.jpg|Ripe pecan nuts on tree\nFile:Carya illinoinensis MHNT.BOT.2011.3.85.jpg|''Carya illinoinensis'', [[MHNT]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Breeding and selection programs ===\nActive breeding and selection programs are carried out by the USDA [[Agricultural Research Service]] with growing locations at [[Brownwood, Texas|Brownwood]] and [[College Station, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://extension-horticulture.tamu.edu/carya/ | publisher=TAMU Horticulture Dept| title=USDA Pecan Breeding Program, National Clonal Germplasm Repository for Pecans and Hickories |accessdate=21 Nov 2014}}</ref> While selection work has been done since the late 1800s, most acreage of pecans grown today is of older cultivars, such as 'Stuart', 'Schley', and 'Desirable', with known flaws but also with known production potential.

Numerous varieties produce well in Texas, but fail in the Southeastern U.S. due to increased disease pressure. Selection programs are ongoing at the state level, with Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Florida, Missouri, and others having trial plantings.\n\nVarieties adapted from the southern tier of states north through some parts of Iowa and even into southern Canada are available from nurseries. Production potential drops significantly when planted further north than Tennessee. Most breeding efforts for northern-adapted varieties have not been on a large enough scale to significantly affect production. Varieties that are available and adapted (e.g., 'Major', 'Martzahn', 'Witte', 'Greenriver', and 'Posey') in [[Hardiness zone|zones 6]] and farther north are almost entirely selections from wild stands. A northern-adapted variety must be grafted onto a northern rootstock to avoid freeze damage.\n\nThe pecan is a 32-chromosome species, and can hybridize with other 32-chromosome members of the ''Carya'' [[genus]], such as ''[[Carya ovata]]'', ''[[Carya laciniosa]]'', and ''[[Carya cordiformis]]''. Most such hybrids are unproductive, though a few second-generation hybrids have potential for producing hickory-flavored nuts with pecan nut structure. Such hybrids are referred to as \"[[hican]]s\" to indicate their hybrid origin.\n\n=== Diseases ===\n{{Main article|List of pecan diseases}}\nIn the Southeastern United States, [[nickel]] deficiency in ''C. illinoinensis'' produces a disorder called mouse-ear in trees fertilized with urea.<ref name=\"BarkerPilbeam2007\">{{cite book|author1=Allen V.

Symptoms of mouse-ear include rounded or blunt leaflet tips which produces smaller leaflets, dwarfing of tree organs, poorly developed root systems, rosetting, delayed bud break, loss of apical dominance, and necrosis of leaflet tips. Mouse-ear can be treated with foliar sprays of nickel. -->  Similarly, zinc deficiency causes rosetting of the leaves.\n\nPecans are also prone to infection by fungi, especially in humid conditions.

Juglandaceae are represented worldwide by between seven and 10 extant genera and more than 60 species. Most of these species are concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere of the New World, but some can be found on every continent except for Antarctica. The first fossil examples of the family appear during the [[Cretaceous]]. Differentiation between the subfamilies of [[Engelhardia | Engelhardioideae]] and Juglandioideae occurred during the early [[Paleogene]], about 64 million years ago. Extant examples of Engelhardioideae are generally tropical and evergreen, while those of Juglandioideae are deciduous and found in more temperate zones. The second major step in the development of WGA11126 pecan was a change from wind-dispersed fruits to animal dispersion. This dispersal strategy coincides with the development of a husk around the fruit and a drastic change in the relative concentrations of fatty acids. The ratio of oleic to linoleic acids are inverted between wind- and animal-dispersed seeds.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2440634 |author=Donald E. Stone|title=New World Juglandaceae. II.

The fruits of the pecan genus ''Carya'' differ from those of the walnut genus ''Juglans'' only in the formation of the husk of the fruit. The husks of walnuts develop from the bracts, bracteoles, and sepals, or sepals only. The husks of pecans develop from the bracts and the bracteoles only.<ref name=\"Paul Manos and Donald E. Stone\" />\n\n== History ==\nBefore European settlement, pecans were widely consumed and traded by Native Americans. As a food source, pecans are a natural choice for preagricultural society. As a wild forage, the fruit of the previous growing season is commonly still edible when found on the ground. Hollow tree trunks, found in abundance in pecan stands, offer ideal storage of pecans by humans and squirrels, alike.<ref name=\"Grant D. Hall\" />\n\nPecans first became known to Europeans in the 16th century. The first Europeans to come into contact with pecans were Spanish explorers in what is now Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana. These Spanish explorers called the pecan, ''nuez de la arruga'', which roughly translates to \"wrinkle nut\". They were called this for their resemblance to wrinkles. The genus ''Carya'' does not exist in the Old World. Because of their familiarity with the genus ''[[Juglans]]'', these early explorers referred to the nuts as ''nogales'' and ''nueces'', the Spanish terms for \"walnut trees\" and \"fruit of the walnut\". They noted the particularly thin shell and acorn-like shape of the fruit, indicating they were indeed referring to pecans.<ref name=\"Grant D. Hall\" /> The Spaniards took the pecan into [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]] beginning in the 16th century. In 1792, [[William Bartram]] reported in his botanical book, ''Travels'', a nut tree, ''Juglans exalata'' that some botanists today argue was the American pecan tree, but others argue was hickory, ''Carya ovata''. Pecan trees are native to the United States, and writing about the pecan tree goes back to the nation's founders. [[Thomas Jefferson]] planted pecan trees, ''C. illinoinensis'' (Illinois nuts), in his nut orchard at his home, Monticello, in Virginia. [[George Washington]] reported in his journal that Thomas Jefferson gave him \"Illinois nuts\", pecans, which Washington then grew at [[Mount Vernon]], his Virginia home.\n\n=== Symbolism ===\nIn 1906, Texas Governor [[James Stephen Hogg]] asked that a pecan tree be planted at his grave instead of a traditional headstone, requesting that the seeds be distributed throughout the state to make Texas a \"Land of Trees\".<ref name=\"Texas Pecan Growers Association\" /> His wish was carried out and this brought more attention to pecan trees. In 1919, the 36th Texas Legislature made the pecan tree the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[Texas]] where the town of [[San Saba, Texas|San Saba]] claims to be \"The Pecan Capital of the World\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sansabatexas.com|title=Town website for San Saba, Texas|publisher=Town of San Saba Texas}}</ref> Several other American towns and regions host annual events celebrating the pecan harvest.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|Carya illinoinensis}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/cail2.htm ''Carya illinoinensis'' images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu]\n* [http://www.uga.edu/nchfp/publications/nchfp/factsheets/preservingpecans.html National Center for Home Food Preservation\u2014Home Preservation of pecans]\n* [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/Spfo/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_2/carya/illinoesis.htm USDA Forest Service: ''Carya illinoensis'']\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/carya-illinoensis-pecan-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map of ''Carya illinoensis'']\n* {{gutenberg|no=28065|name=The Pecan and its Culture}} (Text from 1906)\n* [http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/camden/first-pecan-trees-grown-here-about-1840 First Pecan Trees Grown Here About 1840] historical marker at [[St. Marys, Georgia]]\n\n{{Nuts}}\n\n[[Category:Carya]]\n[[Category:Crops originating from Mexico]]\n[[Category:Crops originating from the United States]]\n[[Category:Cuisine of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Edible nuts and seeds]]\n[[Category:Georgia (U.S. state) culture]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1787]]\n[[Category:Symbols of Texas]]\n[[Category:Trees of Coahuila]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guanajuato]]\n[[Category:Trees of Jalisco]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]\n[[Category:Trees of Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:Trees of Tamaulipas]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Veracruz]]",

It is mostly a high altitude [[mountain]] tree, growing at {{convert|900|m|ft}} \u2013 {{convert|3650|m|ft}} altitude, rarely lower in the northwest of the range; in many areas it reaches the [[tree line|alpine tree line]].\n\n==Description ==\n[[Image:EngelmannSpruce 7777.jpg|left|thumb|Foliage]]\n''Picea engelmannii'' is a medium-sized to large [[evergreen]] [[tree]] growing to {{convert|25|m|ft}} \u2013 {{convert|40|m|ft}} tall, exceptionally to {{convert|65|m|ft}} tall, and with a trunk diameter of up to {{convert|1.5|m|ft}}. The [[bark]] is thin and scaly, flaking off in small circular plates 5\u201310&nbsp;cm across. The crown is narrow conic in young trees, becoming cylindric in older trees. The shoots are buff-brown to orange-brown, usually densely pubescent, and with prominent [[pulvini]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, 15\u201330&nbsp;mm long, rhombic in cross-section, glaucous blue-green above with several thin lines of [[stomata]], and blue-white below with two broad bands of stomata.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|cones]] are pendulous, slender cylindrical, 4\u20138&nbsp;cm long and 1.5&nbsp;cm broad when closed, opening to 3&nbsp;cm broad. They have thin, flexible scales 15\u201320&nbsp;mm long, with a wavy margin. They are reddish to dark purple, maturing pale brown 4\u20137 months after pollination. The [[seed]]s are black, 2\u20133&nbsp;mm long, with a slender, 5\u20138&nbsp;mm long pale brown wing.\n\n==Distribution==\n\nEngelmann spruce extends northward at higher elevations in the Cascade, Monashee, Selkirk, and possibly the Rocky Mountains, as well as the highlands surrounding the Interior Plateau.\n\nBoth water uptake and water stored in [[Root (disambiguation)|roots]] appear to be critical for the survival of subalpine Engelmann spruce saplings that are exposed above the snowpack in later winter-early spring.<ref name=\"boyce\">Boyce, R.L. and Lucero, S.A. 1999. Role of roots in winter water relations of Engelmann spruce saplings. Tree Physiol. 19:893\u2013898.</ref> Transpiration is greatly reduced in small saplings while engulfed in snowpack. For exposed trees, the availability of soil water may be critical in late winter, when transpirational demands increase. Increased rates of [[transpiration]] in response to loss of snowpack, coupled with low sapwood water reserves and an extended period of soil frost in windswept areas, may prevent Engelmann spruce from regenerating in open areas both above and below the tree line. Cuticular damage by windblown ice is probably more important at the tree line,<ref name=\"hadley1\">Hadley, J.L.; Smith, W.K. 1983.

''engelmannii'' ('''Engelmann spruce'''). All of the range except as below.\n*''Picea engelmannii'' subsp. ''mexicana'' ('''Mexican spruce'''). Two isolated populations on high mountains in northern [[Mexico]], on the Sierra del Carmen in [[Coahuila]] ([[Sierra Madre Oriental]]) and on Cerro Mohinora in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] ([[Sierra Madre Occidental]]). Engelmann spruces of the [[Madrean sky islands]] mountains in the extreme southeast of Arizona and southwest of New Mexico also probably belong to this subspecies, though this is disputed.\n\nThe Engelmann spruce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridises]] and intergrades extensively with the closely related [[white spruce]] (''Picea glauca''), found further north and east in the Rocky Mountains, and to a lesser extent with the closely related [[Sitka spruce]] where they meet on the western fringes of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]].\n\n== Uses ==\nEngelmann spruce is of economic importance for its [[wood]], harvested for [[paper]]-making and general construction. Wood from slow-grown trees at high altitude has a specialised use in making musical instruments such as acoustic [[guitar]]s, [[harp]]s, [[violin]]s, and [[piano]]s. It is also used to a small extent as a [[Christmas tree]].\n\n==Predators==\nOutbreaks of [[Dendroctonus rufipennis|spruce beetles]] have destroyed millions of Engelmann spruce trees.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Picea engelmannii.jpg|Tree\nImage:Picea engelmannii Sierra Blanca NM.jpg|Young tree\nImage:Picea_engelmannii_16786.JPG|Section ([[William O.

It appears in the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[Colorado]] and northern [[New Mexico]], with an isolated population in the [[San Francisco Peaks]] in [[Arizona]]. It is usually found at very high altitudes, from 7,000' \u2013 13,000',<ref>http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/highelevationwhitepines/About/dist.htm</ref> in cold, dry [[subalpine climate]] conditions, often at the [[tree line]], although it also forms extensive closed-canopy stands at somewhat lower elevations.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Bristleconeflagstaff.jpg|thumb|left|A [[grove (nature)|grove]] of isolated Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine]]\n\n''Pinus aristata'' is a medium-size [[tree]], reaching {{convert|8|-|20|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|10|-|15|ft|m|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide.<ref>https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/all/pinus-aristata/</ref>  Mature trunk diameter is highly variable.  The bark is grey-brown, thin and scaly at the base of the trunk. The [[leaf|leaves]] ('needles') are in fascicles of five, stout, 2.5\u20134&nbsp;cm long, deep green to blue-green on the outer face, with [[stomata]] confined to a bright white band on the inner surfaces. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are ovoid-cylindrical, 5\u201310&nbsp;cm long and 3\u20134&nbsp;cm broad when closed, purple at first, ripening yellow-buff when 16 months old, with numerous thin, fragile scales, each scale with a bristle-like spine 4\u20138&nbsp;mm long.\n\nThe cones open to 4\u20136&nbsp;cm broad when mature, releasing the [[seed]]s immediately after opening. The seeds are 5&nbsp;mm long, with a 10\u201320&nbsp;mm wing; they are mostly dispersed by the wind, but some are also dispersed by [[Clark's Nutcracker]]s, which pluck the seeds out of the opening cones. The nutcrackers use the seeds as a food resource, storing many for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new plants.\n\n[[File:Pinus Aristata raisin flecks.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pine needle|Needles]] with the typical [[resin]] flecks]]\nIt differs most conspicuously from the two other bristlecone pine species in that the needles usually have only one, (only rarely two) resin canals, and these are commonly interrupted and broken, leading to highly characteristic small white resin flecks appearing on the needles. This character, which looks a bit like '[[dandruff]]' on the needles, is diagnostic of ''Pinus aristata''; no other pine shows it (though sometimes, [[scale insect]] infestations can look superficially similar).\n\nIt is a long-lived tree, though not attaining the longevity of ''[[Pinus longaeva]]''. The oldest known tree, which grows high on [[Black Mountain (near Craig, Colorado)|Black Mountain]] in Colorado, was found to have at 2,435-year tree ring record (and overall estimated age of 2,480 years, per Craig Brunstein) in 1992.<ref name=\"Moore2008\">{{cite book |author1=Moore, Gerry |author2=Kershner, Bruce |author3=Craig Tufts |author4=Daniel Mathews |author5=Gil Nelson |author6=Spellenberg, Richard |author7=Thieret, John W. |author8=Terry Purinton |author9=Block, Andrew |title=National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Trees of North America |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |year=2008 |page=823 |isbn=1-4027-3875-7}}</ref> However, trees rarely live over 1,500 years.\n\nThis species was previously described as a subspecies of ''[[Pinus balfouriana]]'' (''Pinus balfouriana aristata''). ''Pinus aristata'' is currently regarded as one of three closely related species known as [[bristlecone pine]]s and is sometimes named Rocky Mountains bristlecone pine or Colorado bristlecone pine.\nIn addition to its informal and regional names, the trees are referred to as the foxtail pine or hickory pine.\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Pinus aristata'' is by far the most common of the bristlecone pines in cultivation, where it is a very attractive slow-growing small tree suitable for small [[garden]]s in cold climates.

Many of the other pinyon pines have been treated as [[variety (biology)|varieties]] or [[subspecies]] of it at one time or another in the past, but research in the last 10\u201350 years has shown that most are distinct [[species]]. Some botanists still include [[Johann's pinyon]] and ''[[Orizaba pinyon]]'' in Mexican pinyon; the former accounts for records of \"Mexican pinyon\" in southern [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]].\n\nMexican pinyon is a relatively non-variable species, with constant morphology over the entire range except for the [[Disjunct distribution|disjunct]] population in the [[Sierra de la Laguna pine-oak forests]] of Baja California Sur; this is generally treated as a subspecies, ''Pinus cembroides'' subsp. ''lagunae'', although some botanists treat it as a separate species, ''P. lagunae.'' This subspecies differs from the type in having slightly longer leaves, between {{convert|4|cm|in}} and {{convert|7|cm|in}} and longer, narrower cones, up to {{convert|5.5|cm|in}} long.\n\nThe seeds are widely collected in Mexico, being the main edible [[pine nut]] in the region.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*{{IUCN2006|assessor=Conifer Specialist Group|year=1998|id=42350|title=Pinus cembroides|downloaded=12 May 2006}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.pinetum.org/PhotoMPF.htm Photos of ''Pinus cembroides'' tree and foliage]\n*[http://www.pinetum.org/cones/PNDucampopinus.htm Photo of cones (scroll half-way down)]\n\n{{Nuts}}\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Pinus|Cembroides]]\n[[Category:Trees of Northern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Baja California Sur]]\n[[Category:Trees of temperate climates]]\n[[Category:North American desert flora]]\n[[Category:Drought-tolerant trees]]\n[[Category:Edible nuts and seeds]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of North America]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]",

It is widespread and often abundant in this region, forming extensive open woodlands, usually mixed with [[juniper]]s in the [[pinyon-juniper woodland]] [[plant community]]. The Colorado pinyon (pi\u00f1on) grows as the dominant species on 4.8 million acres ({{convert|19,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in Colorado, making up 22% of the state's forests. The Colorado pinyon has cultural meaning to agriculture, as strong pi\u00f1on wood \"plow heads\" were used to break soil for crop planting at the state's earliest known agricultural settlements.\n\nThere is one known example of a Colorado pinyon growing amongst Engelmann spruce (''[[Picea engelmannii]]'') and limber pine (''[[Pinus flexilis]]'') at nearly {{convert|3170|m}} on [[Kendrick Peak]] in the Kaibab National Forest of northern Arizona.\n\n==Description==\nThe pi\u00f1on pine (''Pinus edulis'') is a small to medium size [[tree]], reaching {{convert|10|-|20|m|ft}} tall and with a trunk diameter of up to {{convert|80|cm|in}}, rarely more. The bark is irregularly furrowed and scaly. The [[leaf|leaves]] ('needles') are in pairs, moderately stout, {{convert|3|-|5.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, and green, with [[stomata]] on both inner and outer surfaces but distinctly more on the inner surface forming a whitish band.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|cones]] are globose, {{convert|3|-|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-buff when 18\u201320 months old, with only a small number of thick scales, with typically 5\u201310 fertile scales. The cones open to {{convert|4|-|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} broad when mature, holding the [[seed]]s on the scales after opening. The seeds are {{convert|10|-|14|mm|in}} long, with a thin shell, a white [[endosperm]], and a vestigial {{convert|1|-|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} wing; they are dispersed by the [[pinyon jay]], which plucks the seeds out of the open cones. The jay, which uses the seeds as a food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees.\n\nThe species intermixes with Pinus monophylla sbsp. fallax (see description under [[Pinus monophylla]]) for several hundred kilometers along the Mogollon Rim of central Arizona and the Grand Canyon resulting in trees with both single- and two-needled fascicles on each branch.  The frequency of two-needled fascicles increases following wet years and decreases following dry years.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=Ken|last2=Fisher|first2=Jessica|last3=Arundel|first3=Samantha|last4=Canella|first4=John|last5=Swift|first5=Sandra|title=Geographical and climatic limits of needle types of one- and two-needled pinyon pines|journal=Journal of Biogeography|date=2008|volume=35|pages=357\u2013369|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01786.x}}</ref>  The internal anatomy of both these needle types are identical except for the number of needles in each fascicle suggesting that Little's 1968 designation <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Little|first1=Elbert|title=Two new pinyon varieties from Arizona|journal=Phytologica|date=1968|volume=17|pages=329\u2013342}}</ref> of this tree as a variety of Pinus edulis is more likely than its subsequent designation as a subspecies of Pinus monophylla based entirely upon its single needle fascicle.\n\n==History==\nColorado pinyon was described by [[George Engelmann]] in 1848 from collections made near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] on [[Alexander William Doniphan]]'s expedition to northern Mexico in 1846.\n\nIt is most closely related to the [[single-leaf pinyon]], which [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridises]] with it occasionally where their ranges meet in western Arizona and Utah. It is also closely related to the [[Texas pinyon]], but is separated from it by a gap of about {{convert|100|km|mi}} so does not hybridise with it.\n\nAn isolated population of trees in the [[New York Mountains]] of southeast [[California]], previously thought to be Colorado pinyons, have recently been shown to be a two-needled variant of single-leaf pinyon from chemical and genetic evidence. Occasional two-needled pinyons in northern [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]] have sometimes been referred to Colorado pinyon in the past, but are now known to be hybrids between single-leaf pinyon and [[Parry pinyon]].\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Pinus edulis Snowpeak.jpg|thumb|Cones of ''P.&nbsp;edulis'']]\nThe [[List of edible seeds|edible seeds]], [[pine nut]]s, are extensively collected throughout its range; in many areas, the seed harvest rights are owned by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes, for whom the species is of immense cultural and economic importance. One early legend asserts that the \"tree of life\" is a pinyon pine, rooted in ancient cultural sites found within areas of pinyon (pi\u00f1on) Canyon, Colorado.\n\nThe [[habitat destruction]] by [[deforestation]] of large areas of pinyon forests in the interests of [[cattle]] ranching, for habitat conversion to [[grazing]] [[rangeland]], is seen by many as an act of major ecological and cultural vandalism.\n\nColorado pinyon is also occasionally planted as an ornamental tree and sometimes used as a [[Christmas tree]].\n\nThe pi\u00f1on pine (''Pinus edulis'') is the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[New Mexico]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Habitat fragmentation]]\n\n==References==\n{{notes}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Ronald M.

This [[pine]] is a medium-sized species with a height of 20\u201330 m and a trunk diameter of 35\u201380&nbsp;cm.\n\nThe branches are sparse and very stout, giving the tree a distinct appearance. The needles, among the longest of any pine, are in bundles of three (occasionally five), 20\u201340&nbsp;cm long, stout, and spreading to slightly drooping. The cones are 8\u201316&nbsp;cm long, green or purple when growing, maturing glossy brown, moderately oblique with stoutly spined scales on the outer side (facing away from the branch). The Apache pine sometimes shows a grass stage like the related [[Michoacan pine]] (''P. devoniana'') and also longleaf pine (''[[Pinus palustris|P. palustris]]'').\n\nThe English name refers to the species' occurrence in the lands of the [[Apache Tribe|Apache]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], while the scientific name commemorates the pioneering American botanist [[George Engelmann]] who discovered the species in 1848. Engelmann first named the species ''Pinus macrophylla'', but this name had already been used for another pine, so it had to be renamed; this was done by the French botanist Carri\u00e8re, who chose to honour Engelmann.\n\nApache pine was sometimes treated as a variety of ponderosa pine in the past (as ''[[Pinus ponderosa|P. ponderosa]]'' var.

In favourable conditions, it makes a tree to {{convert|20|m|ft|round=5|sp=us}}, rarely {{convert|25|m|ft|round=5|sp=us}} tall.  However, on exposed treeline sites, mature trees are much smaller, reaching heights of only {{convert|5|-|10|m|ft|round=5|sp=us}}.<ref name=\"Moore2008\" />  In steeply-sloping, rocky, and windswept terrain in the Rocky Mountains of southern Alberta, limber pine is even more stunted, occurring in old stands where mature trees are consistently less than {{convert|3|m|ft|0}} in height.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Letts|first1=M.G.|first2=K.N.|last2=Nakonechny|first3=K.E.|last3=Van Gaalen|first4=C.M.|last4=Smith|year=2009|url=http://people.uleth.ca/~matthew.letts/Letts%20et%20al%202009%20CJFR.pdf|title=Physiological acclimation of ''Pinus flexilis'' to drought stress on contrasting slope aspects in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada|journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research|volume=39|issue=3|pages=629\u2013641|doi=10.1139/X08-206}}</ref>\n\nOne of the world's oldest living Limber Pine trees grows on the banks of the upper North Saskatchewan River at Whirlpool Point in Alberta.\nRecent measurements give a maximum girth of 185\".  In 1986 a core sample 10cm  was retrieved by two researchers who counted 400 rings.\nExtrapolating his data gives an age close to 3000 years.\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Limberpinecone.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Limber pine cone from [[San Jacinto Mountains]], [[Peninsular Ranges]]]]\n''P. flexilis'',  is an important source of food for several species, including [[pine squirrel|red squirrels]] and [[Clark's nutcracker]]s. [[American black bear]]s may raid squirrel caches for limber pine nuts. Squirrels, [[Northern flicker]]s, and [[mountain bluebird]]s often nest in the trees.\n\n== Related species ==\n''P. flexilis'' is a member of the [[Pinus classification|white pine]] group, ''[[Pinus]]'' subgenus ''[[Strobus]]'', and like all members of that group, the leaves ('needles') are in [[fascicle (botany)|fascicles]] (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. This distinguishes it from the [[lodgepole pine]], with two needles per fascicle, and the [[bristlecone pine]]s, which share five needles per fascicle but have a semi-persistent sheath.\n[[File:Pinus flexilis male cones.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Male cones of a limber pine, eastern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], California]]\n\n=== ''Pinus albicaulis'' ===\nDistinguishing limber pine from the related [[whitebark pine]] (''P. albicaulis''), also a white pine, is very much more difficult, and can only easily be done by the cones. In limber pine, the cones are {{convert|6-12|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long where the species overlap, green when immature, and open to release the seeds; the scales are not fragile. In whitebark pine, the cones are {{convert|4|-|7|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long, dark purple when immature, and do not open on drying, but are fragile and are pulled apart by birds (see below) to release the seeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinetum.org/cones/PNStrobus.htm|title=''Pinus'' subgenus ''Strobus''|work=Michael P. Frank's Cone Collection|publisher=Arboretum de Villardebelle}}</ref> A useful clue is that whitebark pines almost never have intact old cones lying under them, whereas limber pines usually do.\n<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roady|first1=Laura|title=Whitebark Pine|url=http://fwp.mt.gov/mtoutdoors/HTML/articles/portraits/whitebarkpine.htm|website=Montana Outdoors|publisher=Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks|accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Pinus monticola'' ===\nIn the absence of cones, limber pine can also be hard to tell from [[Western white pine]] (''P. monticola'') where they occur together in the northern Rockies and the Sierra Nevada east slope. The most useful clue here is that limber pine needles are entire (smooth when rubbed gently in both directions), whereas Western white pine needles are finely serrated (feeling rough when rubbed gently from tip to base). Limber pine needles are also usually shorter, {{convert|4|-|7|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long, while western white pine needles are {{convert|5|-|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}}, though the ranges overlap.\n\n== Diseases ==\nLimber pine is susceptible to [[white pine blister rust]], caused by ''Cronartium ribicola'', a fungus that was introduced accidentally from Europe. Limber pine mortality is high in many areas throughout its range, except [[Arizona]], where it has not yet been found. However, there is little hope of controlling the blister rust in existing trees. Research is under way, locating and breeding from the occasional naturally resistant limber pines, and by studying the resistance mechanisms of the European and Asian white pines (e.g. [[Swiss pine]], [[Macedonian pine]]), which are strongly resistant to the disease.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nThe popular [[cultivar]] ''P. flexilis'' 'Vanderwolf's Pyramid' is widely available as an [[ornamental tree]] for [[garden]]s. 'Vanderwolf's Pyramid' derives from ''P. reflexa'', though it is usually listed in nursery catalogs under ''P. flexilis''.\n\nThe Southwestern white pine is popular as a windbreak tree or an ornamental tree due to its drought tolerance.  It is also grown as a [[Christmas tree]], liked for the soft needles but with stiffer branches than an [[Eastern white pine]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Burmis Tree]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Further reading ===\n* {{cite book | last1 = Chase| first1 = J.

The range extends from southeast [[Arizona]] and southwest [[New Mexico]], [[United States]], south in [[Mexico]] along the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] and the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] to southern [[Zacatecas]] and [[San Luis Potos\u00ed (state)|San Luis Potos\u00ed]]. It occurs at moderate to high altitudes, from {{convert|1600|-|3000|m|ft}}, in cool, dry climate conditions.\n\n==Description==\n''Pinus johannis'' is a small to medium-size [[tree]], often just a [[shrub]], reaching {{convert|4|-|10|m|ft}}  tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 50&nbsp;cm. The bark is grey-brown, thin and scaly at the base of the trunk. The [[leaf|leaves]] ('needles') are in mixed fascicles of three and four, slender, 3\u20136&nbsp;cm long, and deep green to blue-green, with [[stomata]] confined to a bright white band on the inner surfaces.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|cones]] are globose, 2\u20134&nbsp;cm long and 2\u20133&nbsp;cm broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-brown when 16\u201318 months old, with only a small number of thin, fragile scales, typically 6-12 fertile scales. The cones open to 3\u20135&nbsp;cm broad when mature, holding the [[seed]]s on the scales after opening. The seeds are 9\u201312&nbsp;mm long, with a thick shell, a white [[endosperm]], and a vestigial 1\u20132&nbsp;mm wing; they are dispersed by the [[Mexican jay]], which plucks the seeds out of the open cones. The jay, which uses the seeds as a major food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use; some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees.\n\n==History==\n''Pinus johannis'' is a recently described [[pinyon pine]], discovered by [[Elbert L. Little]] in 1968 when comparing pinyons growing in Arizona with those of typical Mexican pinyon (''[[Pinus cembroides]]'') in Mexico; he described it as a [[variety (biology)|variety]] of Mexican pinyon, ''Pinus cembroides'' var. ''bicolor'', noting the very different stomatal placing on the leaves; it also differs in needle number, with 3\u20134 per fascicle, rather than 2\u20133; in the cones having thinner scales; and in having a denser, more rounded crown. Further research by the French botanist Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Robert-Passini, the American botanists Dana K. Bailey and Frank G. Hawksworth and others, has shown that it is better treated as a distinct [[species]]. Although often occurring together with Mexican pinyon, it is reproductively isolated from that by its [[pollination]] being a month to two months later in summer, rather than in spring, thereby preventing [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]].\n\nAs Robert-Passini and Bailey & Hawksworth were working in different areas at about the same time, it was raised to species rank twice, first as ''Pinus johannis'' by Robert-Passini (naming it after her husband Jean) examining specimens in the Sierra Madre Oriental in Mexico, and then later as ''Pinus discolor'' by Bailey & Hawksworth examining specimens in the northern Sierra Madre Occidental in Arizona.\n\nThere are slight differences between the plants in the two ranges; those in the eastern being more shrubby and with larger cones than those in the western range, and also differences in the [[resin]] composition; they are though generally very similar and recognition of both as separate species from each other does not appear warranted.\n\nSome botanists also still include ''P.&nbsp;johannis'' in Mexican pinyon as a variety or even not distinguished at all, accounting for reports of \"Mexican pinyon\" in Arizona and New Mexico. This is despite the two frequently occurring together at the same sites with no hybridisation.\n\n''P.&nbsp;johannis'' is most closely allied to Orizaba pinyon (''[[Pinus orizabensis]]'') and Potosi pinyon (''[[Pinus culminicola]]''), with which it shares the leaf structure with the stomata confined to the inner faces; it differs from the former in the smaller cones and seeds, and from the latter in fewer needles per fascicle (3-4 vs 5).\n\n==Uses==\nThe edible [[pine nut]] seeds are collected in Mexico to a small extent.\n\nThe white-glaucous inner surfaces of the needles make it a very attractive small tree, suitable for [[park]]s and large [[garden]]s.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.pinetum.org/PhotoMPF.htm Pinetum.org - Photos of ''Pinus johannis'' tree and foliage (scroll half-way down)]\n*[http://www.pinetum.org/cones/PNDucampopinus.htm Pinetum.org - Photo of cones (scroll half-way down)]\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Pinus|johannis]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of Northwestern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Flora of Northeastern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Flora of Sonora]]\n[[Category:Flora of Zacatecas]]\n[[Category:Flora of San Luis Potos\u00ed]]\n[[Category:Flora of Arizona]]\n[[Category:Flora of New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Sierra Madre Occidental]]\n[[Category:Sierra Madre Oriental]]\n[[Category:Edible nuts and seeds]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Drought-tolerant trees]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1978]]",

The Mexican range extends along the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] and [[Sierra Madre del Sur]] from [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] to [[Oaxaca]], from 29\u00b0 North Lat. to 17\u00b0, between 1600 and 3000&nbsp;meters altitude. It requires about a rainfall 600 to 1000&nbsp;mm a year, mostly in summer. It tolerates frosts in winter.\n\n==Description==\nThis member of family [[Pinaceae]] grows to the height of 20&ndash;30 m with a trunk diameter of 35&ndash;80&nbsp;cm. The needles are in bundles of three to five, 5&ndash;10&nbsp;cm (rarely to 15&nbsp;cm) long, and are a bright glossy green to yellowish-green. The cones are ovoid, 4&ndash;7&nbsp;cm (rarely to 8&nbsp;cm) long, and borne on a 1&ndash;2&nbsp;cm long stalk; they are unusual in taking about 30&ndash;32 months to mature, a year longer than most other [[pine]]s. The bark is gray-brownish, and fissured.\n\n==Subspecies==\nThere are two subspecies (treated by some botanists as distinct species, by others as just varieties):\n*''Pinus leiophylla'' subsp. ''leiophylla''. Needles slender (0.5&ndash;0.9&nbsp;mm), in fives. It occurs in the southern part of the range, from [[Oaxaca]] to [[Durango]], is not frost tolerant, and grows in relatively high rainfall conditions.\n*''Pinus leiophylla'' subsp. ''chihuahuana''. Needles stouter (0.9&ndash;1.3&nbsp;mm), in threes. It occurs in the northern part of the range, from Durango to Arizona, tolerates frost down to about &minus;10&nbsp;\u00b0C to &minus;15&nbsp;\u00b0C, and very dry conditions.

Its habitat is prone to wildfire, and the species shows some adaptations unusual among pines to cope with this; if the crown is destroyed by fire, the trunk, protected by its thick bark, will send out new shoots to re-grow a new crown. The only other pines to do this are [[Pitch Pine]] (''P. rigida'') and [[Canary Island Pine]] (''P. canariensis''). As none of these are species particularly closely related to each other, the adaptation has probably arisen independently in each, an example of [[convergent evolution]].\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\nThe wood of the ''Pinus leiophylla'' is hard, dense and strong. It is used for construction, firewood, and railroad ties. In [[South Africa]] and [[Queensland]], Australia there are big extensions of this tree planted.

The [[conifer cone|cones]] are acute-globose, the largest of the true pinyons, {{convert|4.5|cm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|8|cm|in|sing=on}} long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-buff when 18\u201320 months old, with only a small number of very thick scales, typically 8-20 fertile scales. The cones thus grow over a two-year (26-month) cycle, so that newer green and older, seed-bearing or open brown cones are on the tree at the same time (see image at left).\n\n[[Image:Pinyon with pine nuts in cone.jpg|right|thumb|190px|Open cone with empty pine nuts]]\nThe cones open to {{convert|6|cm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|9|cm|in|sing=on}} broad when mature, holding the [[seed]]s on the scales after opening. The seeds are {{convert|11|mm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|16|mm|in|sing=on}} long, with a thin shell, a white [[endosperm]], and a vestigial {{convert|1|mm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|2|mm|in|sing=on}} wing. Empty pine nuts with undeveloped seeds (self-pollinated) are a light tan color, while the \"good\" ones are dark brown.<ref name=\"Lanner1981\">Ronald M. Lanner 1981</ref> The pine nuts are dispersed by the [[pinyon jay]], which plucks the seeds out of the open cones, choosing only the dark ones and leaving the light ones (as in image at right).  The jay, which uses the seeds as a food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use by burying them. Some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees.  Indeed, Pinyon seeds will rarely germinate in the wild unless they are cached by jays or other animals.\n\n===Subspecies and genetics===\n\nThere are three subspecies:\n*''Pinus monophylla'' subsp. ''monophylla''. Most of the range, except for the areas below. Needles more stout, bright blue-green, with 2-7 resin canals and 8-16 stomatal lines. Cones are {{convert|5.5|cm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|8|cm|in|sing=on}} long, often longer than broad.\n[[Image:Pinyon snowSilh.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Mature Pinus monophylla subsp. monophylla in snow, Mono Co.

Southernmost Nevada, southwest through southeastern California (northwest only as far as the [[San Jacinto Mountains]]) to 29\u00b0N in northern Baja California. Needles less stout, gray-green, with 8-16 resin canals and 13-18 stomatal lines. Cones are {{convert|4.5|cm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|6|cm|in|sing=on}} long, broader than long.\n*''Pinus monophylla'' subsp. ''fallax'' (E. L. Little) D.K. Bailey. Slopes of the lower [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] valley and adjacent tributaries from [[St. George, Utah]] to the [[Hualapai Mountains]], and along the lower flank of the [[Mogollon Rim]] to [[Silver City, New Mexico]]. Needles less stout, gray-green, with 2-3 resin canals and 8-16 stomatal lines. Cones are {{convert|4.5|cm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|6|cm|in|sing=on}} long, broader than long.\n\nIt is most closely related to the [[Colorado pinyon]], which [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridises]] with it (both subsps. ''monophylla'' and ''fallax'') occasionally where their ranges meet in western Arizona and Utah. It also (subsp. ''californiarum'') hybridises extensively with [[Parry pinyon]].  This classification of pinyon species based only upon the presence of single-needle fascicles is brought into doubt by the reporting of trees from both the Pinus monophylla/Pinus edulis and the Pinus monophylla subsp. fallax/Pinus edulis zones as growing more single needle fascicles after dry years and more two-needled fascicles after wet years.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tausch|first1=R.J.|last2=West|first2=N.E.|editor=Everett, R.L.

Periodic natural wildfire selects for this species by killing other trees, leading to open longleaf pine [[forest]]s or [[Eastern savannas of the United States|savannas]]. New seedlings do not appear at all tree-like and resemble a dark green fountain of needles. This form is called the grass stage. During this stage, which lasts for 5\u201312 years, vertical growth is very slow, and the tree may take a number of years simply to grow ankle-high. After that it makes a growth spurt, especially if there is no [[Canopy (biology)|tree canopy]] above it. In the grass stage, it is very resistant to grass fires, which burn off the ends of the needles, but the fire cannot penetrate the tightly-packed needle bases to reach the bud.  While relatively immune to fire, at this stage, the plant is quite appealing to [[Wild boar#Feral pigs|feral pigs]], and the early settlers' habit of releasing swine into the woodlands to feed was greatly responsible for the decline of the species.\n\nLongleaf pine forests are rich in [[biodiversity]]. They are well-documented for their high levels of plant diversity, in groups including sedges, grasses, carnivorous plants and orchids.<ref>Peet, R. K. and D. J Allard. 1993.

The [[red-cockaded woodpecker]] is dependent on mature pine forests and is now [[conservation status|endangered]] as a result of this decline. Longleaf pine [[seed]]s are large and nutritious, forming a significant food source for [[bird]]s (notably the [[brown-headed nuthatch]]) and other [[wildlife]]. There are 9 [[salamander]] species and 26 [[frog]] species that are characteristic of pine savannas, along with 56 species of [[reptile]]s, 13 of which could be considered specialists on this habitat.<ref>Means, D. Bruce. 2006. Vertebrate faunal diversity in longleaf pine savannas. Pages 155-213 in S. Jose, E. Jokela and D. Miller (eds.) Longleaf Pine Ecosystems: Ecology, Management and Restoration.

These forests have been burned regularly for many decades to encourage [[bobwhite quail]] habitat in private hunting plantations.\n\n==Uses==\n[[Image:Pinus palustris Pengo.jpg|thumb|''Pinus palustris'']]\nVast forests of longleaf pine once were present along the southeastern [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast and [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf Coast]] of [[North America]], as part of the [[Eastern savannas of the United States|eastern savannas]]. These forests were the source of naval stores - [[resin]], [[turpentine]], and [[timber]] - needed by [[merchant]]s and the [[navy]] for their [[ship]]s. They have been cutover since for timber and usually replaced with faster-growing [[loblolly pine]] and [[Pinus elliottii|slash pine]], for [[agriculture]], and for urban and suburban development. Due to this deforestation and over-harvesting, only about 3% of the original longleaf pine forest remains, and little new is planted. Longleaf pine is available, however, at many nurseries within its range; the southernmost known point of sale is in [[Lake Worth, Florida|Lake Worth]], [[Florida]].\n\nThe yellow, [[resin]]ous [[wood]] is used for [[lumber]] and [[Wood pulp|pulp]]. Boards cut years ago from virgin [[timber]] were very wide, up to {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and a thriving salvage business obtains these boards from demolition projects to be reused as flooring in upscale homes.\n\nThe extremely long needles are popular for use in the ancient craft of coiled basket making.\n\nThe stumps and taproots of old trees become saturated with resin and will not rot. Farmers sometimes find old buried stumps in fields, even in some that were cleared a century ago, and these usually are dug up and sold as [[Fatwood]], \"fat lighter\" or \"lighter wood\" which is in demand as kindling for fireplaces, wood stoves, and barbecue pits. In old growth pine the [[heartwood]] of the [[Trunk (botany)|bole]] is often saturated in the same way. When boards are cut from the fat lighter wood, they are very heavy and will not rot, but buildings constructed of them are quite flammable and make extremely hot fires.\n\nThe longleaf pine is the official [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[Alabama]]<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = Southern Longleaf Pine\n| work = Official Symbols and Emblems of Alabama\n| accessdate = 2009-04-04\n| url = http://www.archives.state.al.us/emblems/st_tree.html\n}}</ref> and although all pines are considered the state tree of [[North Carolina]],<ref>http://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter_145/gs_145-3.html</ref> the longleaf pine is specifically lauded in the official state toast.<ref>North Carolina General Statutes \u00a7 149\u20112 http://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter_149/gs_149-2.html</ref>\n\n==Native range, restoration, and protection==\nBefore European settlement, longleaf pine forest dominated as much as {{convert|90000000|acre|km2}} stretching from [[Virginia]] south to [[Florida]] and west to [[East Texas|eastern Texas]]. Its range was defined by the frequent widespread fires that occurred throughout the southeast. In the late 19th century, these virgin timber stands were \"among the most sought after timber trees in the country.\" This rich ecosystem now has been relegated to less than 5% of its pre-settlement range due to [[clear cutting]] practices:\n\n<blockquote>As they stripped the woods of their trees, loggers left mounds of flammable debris that frequently fueled catastrophic fires, destroying both the remaining trees and seedlings. The exposed earth left behind by clear cutting operations was highly susceptible to erosion, and nutrients were washed from the already porous soils. This further destroyed the natural seeding process. At the peak of the timber cutting in the 1890s and the first decade of the new century, the longleaf pine forests of the Sandhills were providing millions of board feet of timber each year. The timber cutters gradually moved across the South; by the 1920s, most of the \"limitless\" virgin longleaf pine forests were gone.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nIn \"[[pine barrens]]\" most of the day. Low, level, sandy tracts; the pines wide apart; the sunny spaces between full of beautiful abounding grasses, [[liatris]], long, wand-like [[Goldenrod|solidago]], [[Serenoa|saw palmettos]], etc., covering the ground in garden style. Here I sauntered in delightful freedom, meeting none of the cat-clawed vines, or shrubs, of the alluvial bottoms. \u2013 [[John Muir]]\n</blockquote>\n\nEfforts are being made to restore longleaf pine ecosystems within its natural range. Some groups such as the Longleaf Alliance are actively promoting research, education, and management of the longleaf pine.<ref name=\"longleafalliance\">{{Cite web\n| title = Longleaf Pine Forests and Longleaf Alliance Home\n| work = Longleaf Alliance\n| accessdate = 2009-04-04\n| url = http://www.longleafalliance.org/\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[USDA]] offers cost-sharing and technical assistance to private landowners for longleaf restoration through the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service|NRCS]] Longleaf Pine Initiative. Similar programs are available through most state forestry agencies in the longleaf's native range. In August 2009, the Alabama Forestry Commission received 1.757 million dollars in stimulus money to restore longleaf pines in state forests.<ref name=\"birminghamnews\">{{Cite web\n| title = Stimulus to fund repopulation of longleaf pines in Alabama\n| work = The Birmingham News\n| accessdate = 2009-09-01\n| url = http://www.al.com/news/birminghamnews/statebriefs.ssf?/base/news/1251792925311250.xml&coll=2\n}}</ref>\n\nThere are four large core areas within the range of the species that provide the opportunity to protect the biological diversity of the coastal plain, as well as to restore wilderness areas east of the Mississippi River.<ref>Keddy, P.A. 2009. Thinking big: A conservation vision for the Southeastern coastal plain of North America. Southeastern Naturalist 8: 213-226.</ref> Each of these four ([[Eglin Air Force Base]]: 187,000+ ha; [[Apalachicola National Forest]]: 228,000+ ha; [[Okefenokee]]-[[Osceola National Forest|Osceola]]: 289,000+ ha; [[De Soto National Forest]]: 200,000+ ha) have nearby lands that offer the potential to expand the total protected territory for each area to well beyond 500,000 ha. These areas would provide the opportunity not only to restore forest stands, but to restore populations of native vertebrate animals threatened by landscape fragmentation.\n\nNotable eccentric populations exist within the [[Uwharrie National Forest]] in the central Piedmont region of North Carolina. These have survived owing to relative inaccessibility and, in one instance, intentional protection in the 20th century by a private landowner (a property now owned and conserved by the Land Trust of Central North Carolina).\n[[Image:LongleafPine.jpg|right|thumb|Naturally regenerated longleaf pines in [[DeSoto National Forest]], [[Mississippi]]]]\n\nThe United States Forest Service is conducting prescribed burning programs in the 258,864-acre [[Francis Marion National Forest]], located outside of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. They are hoping to increase the longleaf pine forest type to {{convert|44700|acre|km2}} by 2017 and {{convert|53500|acre|km2}} in the long term.  In addition to Longleaf restoration, prescribed burning will enhance the endangered Red-cockaded Woodpeckers' preferred habitat of open, park-like stands, provide habitat for wildlife dependent on grass-shrub habitat, which is very limited, and reduce the risk of damaging wildfires.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r8/fms/fmarion/resources/documents/FM_2006_MonitoringRpt_final.pdf |title=Fiscal Year 2006 Monitoring and Evaluation Annual Report |work=Francis Marion National Forest |publisher=United States Forest Service |date=2007-09-26 |accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s, Longleaf restoration has been ongoing on almost 95,000 acres of state and federal land in the [[Sandhills (Carolina)|sandhills]] region of South Carolina, between the [[Piedmont (United States)|piedmont]] and coastal plain.  The region is characterized by deep, infertile sands deposited by a prehistoric sea, with generally arid conditions. By the 1930s, most of the native longleaf had been logged, and the land was heavily eroded. Between 1935-1939, the federal government purchased large portions of this area from local landowners as a relief measure under the [[Resettlement Administration]]. These landowners were resettled on more fertile land elsewhere. Today, the South Carolina Sand Hills State Forest comprises approximately half of the acreage, and half is owned by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] as the adjacent [[Carolina Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge]]. At first, restoration of forest cover was the goal.

The [[bark]] helps to distinguish it from other species. Mature to over-mature individuals have yellow to orange-red bark in broad to very broad plates with black crevices. Younger trees have blackish-brown bark, referred to as \"blackjacks\" by early loggers. Ponderosa pine's five [[subspecies]], as classified by some botanists, can be identified by their characteristically bright, green needles (contrasting with blue-green needles that distinguish [[Jeffrey pine]]). The Pacific subspecies has the longest\u2014{{convert|19.8|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}\u2014and most flexible needles in plume-like [[Fascicle (botany)|fascicles]] of three.

K. Bailey & F. G. Hawksworth\n}}\n\n'''''Pinus remota''''', commonly known as the '''Texas pinyon''' or '''papershell pinyon''', is a [[pine]] in the [[pinyon pine]] group, native to southwestern [[Texas]] and northeastern [[Mexico]].  It can be distinguished from other pinyon species by its thin-walled seeds, which made it especially attractive as a food to [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] and [[Mexicans]] living where it grew.  Spanish explorer [[Cabeza de Vaca]] noted that the papershell pinon was an important food for the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] in 1536.\n\n==Description==\n''Pinus remota'' is a small [[tree]] or large [[shrub]], reaching 3\u201310 m tall and with a trunk [[diameter]] of up to 40&nbsp;cm. The bark is thick, rough, and scaly. The [[leaf|leaves]] ('needles') are in mixed pairs and threes (mostly pairs), slender, 3\u20135&nbsp;cm long, and dull gray-green, with [[stomata]] on both inner and outer surfaces. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are squat globose, 3\u20135&nbsp;cm long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-buff when 18\u201320 months old, with only a small number of thin scales, with typically 5-12 fertile scales.\n\n[[File:Pinus remota.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Pinus remota located in the Mexican state of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] near the [[Big Bend (Texas)|Big Bend]] of Texas.]] \nThe cones open to 4\u20136&nbsp;cm broad when mature, holding the [[seed]]s on the scales after opening. The seeds measure 10\u201312&nbsp;mm long, with a very thin shell, a white [[endosperm]], and a [[vestigial]] 1\u20132&nbsp;mm wing; they are dispersed by the [[Woodhouse's scrub jay]], which plucks the seeds out of the open cones. The jay, which uses the seeds as a food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and able to grow into new trees.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nTexas pinyon was previously included in [[Mexican pinyon]], only being discovered as distinct in 1966 when US [[botanist]] [[Elbert L. Little]] noticed that the seed shells of some pinyons in Texas were very thin compared to many others. He treated it as a [[variety (biology)|variety]] of Mexican pinyon, [[Pinus cembroides]] var. ''remota''. Subsequent research found other differences, and it is now usually treated as a distinct [[species]], probably more closely related to the [[Colorado pinyon]] ''P. edulis'', which shares thin seed shells and needles mostly in pairs. Texas pinyon differs from both Mexican and [[Colorado]] pinyons in the very small, recessed umbo on the cone scales (larger and knob-like on other pinyons).\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe range is in western [[Texas]], United States, on the south edge of the [[Edwards Plateau]] and the hills between [[Fort Stockton, Texas|Fort Stockton]] and [[Presidio, Texas|Presidio]], and in northeastern [[Mexico]], mainly in [[Coahuila]] but also just into [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]. It occurs at low to moderate altitudes, from 450\u2013700 m on the Edwards Plateau and from 1200\u20131800 m in the rest of its range. It is scarce, with small, scattered populations usually on dry, rocky sites and [[arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] where bare rock lowers the likelihood of [[wildfire]] spreading easily.\n\n== Uses ==\nThe edible seeds are occasionally collected like those of other pinyons, and sold as [[pine nut]]s. However, in its barren, dry habitat, infrequent and small crops are normal, reducing its economic value. It is occasionally planted as an [[ornamental tree]], where its remarkable tolerance of drought and even semi-desert conditions makes it valuable in hot, dry areas.\n\n==The papershell pi\u00f1on and Cabeza de Vaca==\nPinus remota has importance in determining the route of Spanish explorer [[Cabeza de Vaca]], the first European to explore [[Texas]] and the northern part of [[Mexico]]. Writing an account of his experiences, Cabeza de Vaca said that in 1535 the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] of the region through which he was passing gave him and his companions pine nuts to eat which were \"better than those of Castile [Spain], because they have very thin shells.\"<ref>Olson, Donald W. ''et al.'' (Oct 1997), \"Pi\u00f1on Pines and the Route of Cabeza de Vaca\", ''Southwestern Historical Quarterly'', October 1997, p 177</ref>\n[[File:Expedition Cabeza de Vaca Karte.png|thumb|right|250px|Route of Cabeza de Vaca, 1528-1536, as proposed by Alex D. Krieger.]]\nIn attempting to determine the route followed by Cabeza de Vaca from near the area of [[Galveston, Texas]] on the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]] coast of Mexico, several scholars, notably Cleve Hallenbeck in 1940, believed that the statement by Cabeza de Vaca referred to the seeds of [[Pinus edulis]], the Colorado pi\u00f1on, which is found in the mountains of southern New Mexico and adjacent Texas\u2014but not in northeastern Mexico.  The Mexican pi\u00f1on ([[Pinus cembroides]]) found in Mexico has thick shells, rather than the thin shells described by Cabeza de Vaca. Therefore, Hallenbeck concluded on the basis of the range of pi\u00f1on species that Cabeza de Vaca had traversed Texas westward from near Galveston to southernmost New Mexico and crossed the [[Rio Grande]] river near [[El Paso, Texas]].\n\nTo the contrary, Alex D. Krieger in a [[doctoral dissertation]] (1961) proposed instead that Cabeza De Vaca had traversed the coast of Texas, crossed the [[Rio Grande]] into Mexico and turned northwest, passing near present-day [[Monclova, Mexico]] and proceeding through Mexico to meet the Rio Grande again near present-day [[Presidio, Texas]].<ref>Chipman, Donald E. \"In Search of Cabeza de Vaca's Route across Texas: An Historiographical Survey\". (Oct 1987) ''Southwestern Historical Quarterly'', http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/colonial/cabezadevaca.pdf, accessed 28 July 2016</ref> Krieger's trans-Mexican route for Cabeza de Vaca was dismissed by proponents of a trans-Texas route because no pi\u00f1on with thin shelled seeds was known to be native to northern Mexico.<ref>Olson, et al., pp 178-180</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1966, botanist [[Elbert L. Little]] first described a subspecies of the Mexican pi\u00f1on with \"thin shelled seeds\" and in 1979 the thin-shelled pi\u00f1on was proposed to be considered as a separate species with the name ''Pinus remota'' or papershell pi\u00f1on.  In 1996, scholars traveled to the Monclova, Mexico area and collected specimens of the papershell pi\u00f1on, thus proving that Cabeza de Vaca might have encountered thin-shelled pi\u00f1on seeds in Mexico as well as in Texas. The trans-Mexico route of Cabeza de Vaca, proposed by Krieger, now has the support of many scholars.<ref>Dolan et al., pp. 184-186</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.pinetum.org/cones/PNDucampopinus.htm Photo of cones (scroll half-way down)]\n\n[[Category:Pinus|remota]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Coahuila]]\n[[Category:Trees of Chihuahua (state)]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]\n[[Category:Trees of Northeastern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Least concern plants]]",

Exceptional specimens may reach {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, the largest of the southern pines. Its needles are in bundles of three, sometimes twisted, and measure {{convert|12|-|22|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; an intermediate length for southern pines, shorter than those of the [[longleaf pine]] or [[slash pine]], but longer than those of the [[Pinus echinata|shortleaf pine]] and [[Pinus glabra|spruce pine]]. The needles usually last up to two years before they fall, which gives the species its evergreen character. Although some needles fall throughout the year due to severe weather, insect damage, and drought, most needles fall during the autumn and winter of their second year. The [[Conifer cone|seed cones]] are green, ripening pale buff-brown, {{convert|7|-|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} broad when closed, opening to {{convert|4|-|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, each scale bearing a sharp 3\u20136&nbsp;mm spine.<ref name=\"Flora\"/><ref name=\"Farjon\">Farjon, A.

In the southern United States, the word is used to mean \"a mudhole; a mire,\" a sense derived from an allusion to the consistency of porridge. Hence the pine is named as it is generally (but not exclusively) found in lowlands and swampy areas.<ref name=freedictionary/> Loblolly pines grow well in acidic clay soil, which is common throughout the South, and are thus often found in large stands in rural places. Other old names, now rarely used, include oldfield pine, due to its status as an [[Ruderal species|early colonizer]] of abandoned fields; bull pine, due to its size (several other [[Pinus classification#Subgenus Pinus - yellow or hard pines|yellow pines]] are also often so named, especially large isolated specimens); rosemary pine, due to loblolly's distinctive fragrance compared to the other southern pines; and North Carolina pine.<ref name=\"Moore2008\">{{cite book |author1=Moore, Gerry |author2=Kershner, Bruce |author3=Craig Tufts |author4=Daniel Mathews |author5=Gil Nelson |author6=Spellenberg, Richard |author7=Thieret, John W. |author8=Terry Purinton |author9=Block, Andrew |title=National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Trees of North America |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |year=2008 |page=73 |isbn=1-4027-3875-7}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[scientific name]], ''[[wikt:Pinus|Pinus]]''  is the Latin name for the pines and ''[[wikt:taeda|taeda]]''  refers to the resinous wood.<ref>[http://www.biosurvey.ou.edu/shrub/pita.htm Oklahoma Biological Survey: ''Pinus taeda'' L.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Tree Types and Barks 004.jpg|left|thumb|Bark on a mature tree]]\n\n== Ecology ==\nWith the advent of [[wildfire suppression]], loblolly pine has come to prevalence in some parts of the deep south that were once dominated by longleaf pine and, especially in northern [[Florida]], [[Pinus elliottii|slash pine]].<ref>Richardson, D.

Aspens do produce seeds, but seldom grow from them. Pollination is inhibited by the fact that aspens are either male or female, and large stands are usually all clones of the same sex. Even if pollinated, the small seeds (three million per pound) are only viable a short time as they lack a stored food source or a protective coating.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\">Ewing, Susan. The Great Alaska Nature Factbook. Portland: Alaska Northwest Books, 1996.</ref>\n\n=== Dieback ===\nBeginning in 1996, individual North American scientists noticed an increase in dead or dying aspen trees. As this accelerated in 2004, word spread and a debate over causes began. No insect, disease, or environmental condition is yet specifically identified as a joint cause. Trees adjacent to one another are often stricken or not. In other instances, entire groves have died.\n\nMany areas of the Western US have experienced increased diebacks which are often attributed to ungulate grazing and [[wildfire suppression]]. At high altitudes where grasses can be rare, [[ungulate]]s can browse young aspen sprouts and prevent those young trees from reaching maturity. As a result, some aspen groves close to cattle or other grazing animals, such as deer or elk, have very few young trees and can be invaded by [[conifers]], which are not typically browsed. Another possible deterrent to aspen regeneration is widespread wildfire suppression.  Aspens are vigorous [[resprouter]]s and even though the above-ground portion of the organism may die in a wild-fire, the roots, which are often protected from lethal temperatures during a fire, will sprout new trees soon after a fire.  Disturbances such as fires seem to be a necessary ecological event in order for aspens to compete with conifers, which tend to replace aspen over long, disturbance-free intervals.  The current dieback in the American West may have roots in the strict fire suppression policy in the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} On the other hand, the widespread decimation of conifer forests by the [[mountain pine beetle]] may provide increased opportunities for aspen groves to proliferate under the right conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112713000352 | doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2013.01.008 | volume=299 | title=How will aspen respond to mountain pine beetle? A review of literature and discussion of knowledge gaps | journal=Forest Ecology and Management | pages=60\u201369}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the vegetative regeneration method of reproduction used by the aspen, where an entire group of trees are essentially clones, there is a concern that something that hits one will eventually kill all of the trees, presuming they share the same vulnerability. A conference was held in Utah in September 2006 to share notes and consider investigative methodology.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/26/science/earth/26aspen.html | work=The New York Times | first=Katie | last=Kelley | title=Emblem of the West Is Dying, and No One Can Figure Out Why | date=26 September 2006}}</ref>\n[[File:Populus tremuloides 8163.jpg|thumb|Typical yellow autumn foliage]]\n[[File:2014-10-05 14 33 30 Aspens showing autumn foliage coloration in Lamoille Canyon, Nevada.JPG|thumb|right|Atypical orange and red autumn foliage]]\n\n== Uses ==\nAspen bark contains a substance that was extracted by indigenous North Americans and European settlers of the western U.S. as a [[quinine]] substitute.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\" />\n\nLike other poplars, aspens make poor [[fuel wood]], as they dry slowly, rot quickly, and do not give off much heat. Yet they are still widely used in campgrounds because they are cheap and plentiful and not widely used in building lumber. Pioneers in the North American west used them to create [[log cabins]] and [[dugout (shelter)|dugouts]], though they were not the preferred species.\n\nThe leaves of the quaking aspen and other species in the genus ''Populus'' serve as food for [[caterpillar]]s of various moths and butterflies. See [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on poplars]].\n\nIn Canada, quaking aspen wood is used mainly for pulp products such as books, newsprint, and fine printing paper. It is especially good for panel products such as [[oriented strand board]] and [[waferboard]]. It is light in weight and is used for furniture, boxes and crates, core stock in plywood, and wall panels.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons and category-inline}}\n* {{Wikispecies-inline}}\n* [http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/poptre/all.html US Forest Service Fire Effects Information System: ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* [http://www.abtreegene.com/trees.html Alberta Forest Genetic Resources Council: ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/populus-tremuloides-quaking-aspen-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map for ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* {{ITIS |id=195773 |taxon=Populus tremuloides |accessdate=8 August 2006}}\n* Farrar, John Laird.

Roots extend to about 50&nbsp;ft (15 m), but depths as much as 175&nbsp;ft (53 m) have been recorded.<ref name=\"fs\" />\n\n[[Image:Prosopis velutina seeds.jpg|thumb|right|Velvet mesquite [[seed]]s]]\n[[Image:Velvet mesquite pods.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Dry velvet mesquite [[Legume|seedpods]]]]\n[[Image:Velvet mesquite catkins.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Flowering velvet mesquite catkins]]\n\nThe mesquite is [[deciduous]], losing its leaves in winter, and leafs out again in the spring when all danger of frost is past.  Because of its deep [[root]] system, it keeps its leaves in the dry months of summer in all but the most severe [[drought]] years.  The [[flower]]s are yellow and form in the spring (after the leaves) in dense cylindrical clusters ([[catkin]]s) roughly {{convert|4|in|cm|abbr=on}} long.  Long seedpods ([[legume]]s) form from the flowers.  They are bright green and look somewhat like pea pods when young. Mature, dry pods are hard and contain several hard, dry, brown [[seed]]s.  The seeds need to be [[Scarification (botany)|scarified]] before they can [[Germination|germinate]].  This scarification typically takes place in the digestive tracts of animals, which eat the seeds and then [[Seed dispersal|disperse]] them widely, as the seed takes days to pass through the animal.<ref>Fisher, C.

In cooperation with: U.S. Department of Agriculture.</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\nThe mesquite contributes greatly to the [[desert]] ecosystem.  [[Coyote]]s, [[Round-tailed Ground Squirrel|round-tailed ground squirrel]]s, [[Collared Peccary|collared peccaries]], [[mule deer]], [[white-tailed deer]], and [[Hare|jackrabbits]] all eat mesquite pods, as do livestock when they are available.<ref name=\"fs\" /> [[Bird]]s feed on the flower buds.  As a member of the legume family, mesquites [[Nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] in the [[soil]].  Mesquites can serve as [[nurse tree]]s to young [[Cactus|cacti]], such as the [[saguaro]]. The shade of its branches provides protection for small [[mammal]]s, especially burrowing animals.  Native Americans used the seeds for food, grinding them into a [[flour]].  The [[bark]] was used for baskets and fabrics and the wood for [[firewood]] and building.  The leaves and [[Natural gum|gum]] were used as [[Herbalism|medicine]].\n\n[[Image:Ground squirrel mesquite.jpg|thumb|right|A round-tailed ground squirrel eating velvet mesquite pods]]\n\nThe range of the velvet mesquite has changed because of grazing.  [[Cattle]] not only [[Seed dispersal|dispersed]] mesquite seeds, but they also [[Overgrazing|overgrazed]] the land, resulting in fewer [[Wildfire|range fires]] to control the mesquite population.  Mesquites grew more densely and spread into what had been grassland.<ref name=\"fs\" />  Consequently, velvet mesquite is considered an [[invasive species]] or noxious weed in several states.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://plants.usda.gov/java/nameSearch?keywordquery=prosopis+velutina\n|title=PLANTS Profile for Prosopis velutina (velvet mesquite) | work=USDA PLANTS\n|accessdate=2008-05-01\n|last=\n|first=\n}}\n</ref>  However, mesquite [[bosque]]s cover only a small fraction of the area they covered before human settlement.  Agriculture, firewood cutting, housing developments, and the lowering of the [[water table]] have all contributed to the loss of native mesquite stands.<ref name=\"fs\" />\n\n==Uses==\n* Velvet mesquite is a common choice for residential and commercial [[xeriscaping]] in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], cities which are inside its natural range.  An established mesquite tree needs little or no watering, and is an attractive [[ornamental plant]].<ref>http://www.amwua.org/quick_search.html?type=&keyword=mesquite&x=0&y=0</ref>\n* Medicinal uses: Sore throats were treated with a hot tea made from a blend of the clear sap plus inner red [[bark]].  Stomachaches were treated with a tea made from the fresh leaves.  Toothache was treated by chewing the soft inner bark of the root.  For flagging appetite, a tea made from the dried leaves was taken before meals.<ref>Felger, R. S. and M. B. Moser, 1985,  ''People of the Desert and Sea.'' University of Arizona Press, Tucson, AZ.</ref>\n* Cosmetic uses: Most important to a select number of folks was mesquite's use against hair loss.   This treatment was used by men only, and consisted of the black sap that oozes from mesquite wounds (not the clear sap) mixed with other secret herbs and applied to the scalp.  Special mesquite herbal soap for \"macho\" hair is still available in parts of Mexico.<ref>Diaz, J. L.  1976.  ''Usos de las Plantas Medicinales de Mexico''.  Instituto Mexicano para el Estudio de las Plantas Medicinals, Mexico, D.F.</ref>\n* Bark was used for baskets and fabrics.\n* Wood is important for firewood and for flavor when grilling meat.\n\n==Food==\n<!-- {{Advert|section=y|date=March 2011}} -->\nMesquite pods are an important source of food for humans as well as native wildlife.  Pods are considered a slow-release food due to [[galactomannin]] gums which have been found to lower [[glycemic]] responses.  Their glycemic index is 25%, compared to 60% for sweet corn, and 100% for white sugar.\n\nDried and toasted, the pods are ground into mesquite meal and mesquite flour.  Both flour and meal are used to make cakes, breads, muffins, and pancakes.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mesquite Bosque]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|26em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=PRVE USDA Plant Profile for ''Prosopis velutina'' (velvet mesquite)]\n* [http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=26883  ITIS  Taxonomy Report]\n* [http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/provel/all.html Species information from the U.S. Forest Service]\n* [http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?query_src=photos_index&where-taxon=Prosopis+velutina Photographs from CalPhotos]\n*[http://seinet.asu.edu/seinet/symbiota/taxa/taxaprofile.php?taxon=Prosopis%20velutina&cl=Superstition%20Mountains%20Wilderness%20Area ''Prosopis velutina'' Pictures and herbarium specimen]\n{{commonscat|position=left|Prosopis velutina}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prosopis Velutina}}\n[[Category:Prosopis|velutina]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Sonoran Deserts]]\n[[Category:Flora of Arizona]]\n[[Category:Flora of New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Flora of Sonora]]\n[[Category:North American desert flora]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1898]]\n[[Category:Invasive plant species]]\n[[Category:Edible legumes]]\n[[Category:Forages]]\n[[Category:Plants used in Native American cuisine]]",

It commonly lives more than 500 years and occasionally more than 1,200 years. The [[bark]] on young trees is thin, smooth, gray, and covered with resin blisters. On mature trees, it is moderately thick (3\u20136&nbsp;cm), furrowed and corky though much less so than coast Douglas-fir.\n\n[[File:2013-07-14 09 27 54 Douglas fir foliage along Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive in Great Basin National Park, Nevada.jpg|thumb|left|Foliage]]\nThe shoots are brown to gray-brown, smooth, though not as smooth as [[fir]] shoots, and finely pubescent with scattered short hairs. The [[bud]]s are a distinctive narrow conic shape, 3\u20136&nbsp;mm long, with red-brown bud scales. The leaves are spirally arranged but slightly twisted at the base to be upswept above the shoot, needle-like, 2\u20133&nbsp;cm long, gray-green to blue-green above with a single broad [[stomata]]l patch, and with two whitish stomatal bands below.\n\nThe male ([[pollen]]) cones are 2\u20133&nbsp;cm long, and are typically restricted to or more abundant on lower branches. Pollen cones develop over 1 year and wind-dispersed pollen is released for several weeks in the spring.\n\n[[Image:Pseudotsuga glauca cones.jpg|right|thumb|thumb|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir cones<br/>Left: [[Shuswap Lake]], [[British Columbia]], Canada<br/>Right: [[Chiricahua Mountains]], [[Arizona]], U.S.]]\n\nThe mature female [[Conifer cone|seed cones]] are pendent, 4\u20137&nbsp;cm long, 2&nbsp;cm broad when closed, opening to 3\u20134&nbsp;cm broad. They are produced in spring, purple (sometimes green) at first, maturing orange-brown in the autumn 5\u20137 months later. The seeds are 5\u20136&nbsp;mm long and 3\u20134&nbsp;mm broad, with a 12\u201315&nbsp;mm wing. Both coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir produce abundant crops of seed approximately every 2\u201311&nbsp;years. Seed is produced annually except for about 1 year in any 4-to-5-year period.\n\n==Growth==\n[[File:Pseudotsuga menziesii Thompson-Nicola BC.jpg|thumb|right|Douglas-fir, British Columbia]]\n\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir grows more slowly than coast Douglas-fir and is also much more cold tolerant. Tolerance of different environmental conditions varies among populations of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, especially among populations from the northern and southern Rockies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=J.|author2=Marshall, J.D. |author3=Jaquish, B.C. |title=Genetic differentiation in carbon isotope discrimination and gas exchange in ''Pseudotsuga menziesii''|journal=Oecologia|year=1993|volume=93|issue=1|pages=80\u201387|doi=10.1007/BF00321195|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p0m37l5717103783/}}</ref>  However, even nearby populations can differ in cold hardiness.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rehfeldt|first=G.E.|title=Ecological adaptations in Douglas-Fir (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var.

The most prominent lateral roots begin in the 1st or 2nd year of growth. Most roots in surface soil are \"long ropelike laterals of secondary and tertiary origin\". Fine-root production is episodic in response to changing environmental conditions; the average lifespan of fine roots is usually between several days and several weeks.\n\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir reaches reproductive maturity at 12\u201315 years. It has winged seeds that are dispersed primarily by wind and [[gravity]]. In western [[Montana]] clearcuts, seeds were dispersed up to {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} uphill from their source, but seedfall between {{convert|180|\u2013|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} was only 7% of that found in uncut stands. Other studies determined that seedfall in [[clearcutting|clearcuts]] beyond {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on}} from seed trees was about 3% of seedfall in uncut stands where seed trees are close together. Well-stocked stands have resulted from seedfall from sources {{convert|1|\u2013|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} distant, but most Douglas-fir seeds fall within {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of their source. Small amounts of seed are dispersed by mice, [[chipmunk]]s, and [[squirrel]]s. Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir seeds are disseminated about twice as far as seeds of [[ponderosa pine]].\n\n==Longevity==\nThe oldest accurately-dated Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, 1275 years old, is in [[New Mexico]]. This longevity is apparently uncommon; growing on a relatively barren lava field has protected it from fire, animals, and humans. Growth typically slows dramatically between 90 and 140 years of age.\n\nIn the dry-belt forests of central [[British Columbia]], ages can exceed 500 years on sites normal for the region. The oldest accurately-dated growth ring available for the region is 1475; dates in the 1500s and 1600s are more common for remnant patches that have escaped logging, fire, and other disturbances.\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:USA 10638 Bryce Canyon Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine, [[Bryce Canyon National Park]], Utah]]\n\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir grows on a variety of sites across its wide geographic range. It grows at lower elevations adjacent to and within [[bunchgrass]] communities and is also found in upper-elevation subalpine forests. It tends to be most abundant in low- and middle-elevation forests, where it grows over a wide range of aspects, slopes, landforms, and soils.\n\nIn spring and winter (in British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana) [[elk]] browse on south- and southwest-facing Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands, particularly when shrubs and/or grasses are productive. In summer, elk generally are found at higher elevations (outside the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and Pacific ponderosa pine zones). During fall, elk use stands of Rocky Mountain [[lodgepole pine]], [[subalpine fir]], [[western larch]], or [[grand fir]] with high canopy cover.\n\nIn parts of [[Yellowstone National Park]], elk browsing is so intensive that young Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir are stunted at {{convert|1|\u2013|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height, with live branches trailing very close to the ground, and branches on the upper two thirds of the tree dead. Low-elevation and south-facing open-structure Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir types are often important winter range for [[white-tailed deer]] and [[mule deer]]. [[Moose]] winter in low-elevation Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir types in areas where willow thickets, the preferred winter habitat, are lacking; in such areas Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is an important moose food.\n\n[[Chipmunk]]s, [[mouse|mice]], [[vole]]s, and [[shrew]]s eat large quantities of conifer seeds from the forest floor, and clipped cones are a staple and major part of storage of red squirrels. These animals store a large amount of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir cones or seeds. [[American marten]] commonly den in hollow logs.\n\nNumerous species of [[songbird]]s extract seeds from Douglas-fir cones or forage for seeds on the ground. The most common are the [[Clark's nutcracker]], [[black-capped chickadee]], [[mountain chickadee]], [[boreal chickadee]], [[red-breasted nuthatch]], [[pygmy nuthatch]], [[red crossbill]], [[Two-barred crossbill|white-winged crossbill]], [[dark-eyed junco]], and [[pine siskin]]. Migrating flocks of dark-eyed juncos may consume vast quantities of seeds and freshly germinated seedlings. [[Woodpecker]]s commonly feed in the bark of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. [[Blue grouse]] forage on needles and buds in winter; they and other birds rely heavily on Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir communities for cover.\n\nThe Douglas-fir is vulnerable to infestation by a [[Eriosomatidae|woolly]] [[aphid]], ''[[Gall Adelgid|Adelges cooleyi]]'' that also infects the [[Engelmann spruce]] to complete its [[Gall Adelgid#Life cycle|lifecycle]].\n\n==Uses==\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir is a valuable timber tree. The wood is exceptionally strong and is used for structural timber as well as poles, [[plywood]], pulp, dimensional [[lumber]], railroad ties, mine timbers, log cabins, posts and poles, fencing, and firewood. Other uses listed include \"machine-stress-rated lumber\", glued-laminated (Glulam) beams, pallets, furniture, cabinets, doors, flooring, window frames, and other miscellaneous woodwork and [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]]. Rocky Mountain Douglas-firs are also cut and sold as Christmas trees.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Commons|Pseudotsuga_menziesii#Pseudotsuga_menziesii_var._glauca|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=PSMEG USDA Plant Profile: ''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var.

The plant has thick fleshy roots, flourishes in rich, rather moist soil.  In the [[Mississippi embayment]] (Mississippi River Valley) it is found most frequently on rocky slopes as part of the undergrowth. Its juices are acrid and bitter and the bark possesses tonic properties.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nThe [[twig]]s are slender to moderately stout, brown with deep U-shaped leaf scars, and with short, light brown, fuzzy buds. The [[Leaf|leaves]] are alternate, 5\u201318&nbsp;cm long, palmately compound with three (rarely five) leaflets, each leaflet 1\u201310&nbsp;cm long, sparsely serrated or entire, shiny dark green above, paler below. The western and southwestern forms have smaller leaves (5\u201311&nbsp;cm) than the eastern forms (10\u201318&nbsp;cm), an adaptation to the drier [[climate]]s there.\n\nThe [[flower]]s are small, 1\u20132&nbsp;cm across, with 4-5 narrow, greenish white petals, produced in terminal, branched clusters in spring: some find the odor unpleasant but to others trifoliata has a delicious scent. The [[fruit]] is a round wafer-like papery [[Samara (fruit)|samara]], 2-2.5&nbsp;cm across, light brown, maturing in summer.  Seed vessel has a thin wing and is held on tree until high winds during early winter.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nThe [[bark]] is reddish brown to gray brown, short horizontal [[lenticel]]s, warty corky ridges, becoming slightly scaly, [[unpleasant odor]] and bitter taste. It has several [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] uses as a seasoning and as an [[herbalism|herbal medicine]] for different ailments.<ref>[http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Ptelea+trifoliata University of Michigan - Dearborn: Native American Ethnobotany, species account.] . accessed 8.24.2011</ref>\n\n* Bark: Dark reddish brown, smooth.  Branchlets dark reddish brown, shining, covered with small excrescences.  Bitter and ill-scented.\n* Wood: Yellow brown; heavy, hard, close-grained, satiny.  Sp. gr., 0.8319; weight of cu. ft., 51.84&nbsp;lbs.\n* Winter buds: Small, depressed, round, pale, covered with silvery hairs.\n* Leaves: Alternate, compound, three-parted, dotted with oil glands.  Leaflets sessile, ovate or oblong, three to five inches long, by two to three broad, pointed at base, entire or serrate, gradially pointed at apex.  Feather-veined, midrib and primary veins prominent.  They come out of the bud conduplicate, very downy, when full grown are dark green, shining above, paler green beneath.  In autumn they turn a rusty yellow.  Petioles stout, two and a half to three inches long, base enlarged.  Stipules wanting.\n* Flowers: May, June.  [[Polygamomonoecious]], greenish white.  Fertile and sterile flowers produced together in terminal, spreading, compound cymes; the sterile being usually fewer, and falling after the anther cells mature.  Pedicels downy.\n* Calyx: Four or five-parted, downy, imbricate in the bud.\n* Corolla: Petals four or five, white, downy, spreading, hypogynous, imbricate in bud.\n* Stamens: Five, alternate with the petals, hypogynous, the psitillate flowers with rudimentary anters; filaments awl-shaped, more or less hairy; anthers ovate or cordate, two-celled, cells opening longitudinally.\n* Pistils: Ovary superior, hairy, abortive in the staminate flowers, two to three-celled; style short; stigma two to three-lobed; ovules two in each cell.\n* Fruit: Samara, orbicular, surrounded by a broad, many-veined reticulate membranous ring, two-seeded.  Ripens in October and hangs in clusters until midwinter.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n==Cultivation==\nNumerous [[cultivars]] have been developed for ornamental use in parks and gardens.

Lateral roots and woody rhizomes are widespread near the soil surface. Ninety percent or more of shinnery oak's biomass is under ground, and fortuitous root grafting is common. These underground stems commonly spread to form plants 3 to 15 m or more in diameter.  Single clones are reported to cover up to 81 ha and to achieve ages over 13,000 years.<ref name=Peterson/>\n\n'''Flowers:'''  Shinnery oak is monoecious with both female and male flowers borne separately on the same plant.<ref name=Flora/>  Male [[catkins]] are densely flowered, 1.5-3.8&nbsp;cm long, and hang downward. Female catkins are 3\u20137&nbsp;mm long, contain 1 to 5 flowers, and are usually axillary on young shoots.  Shinnery oaks are wind pollinated, and flowering occurs in the spring.\n\n'''Acorns:''' Acorns develop in 1 year, maturing in the autumn.  Acorns occur alone or in clusters of 2 or 3, and are 12\u201325&nbsp;mm long by 14\u201318&nbsp;mm wide. A scaly cup covers about 1/3 to 1/2 of the nut.  On average, acorn crops are produced in 3 out of 10 years.<ref name=Gucker/>\n\n'''Foliage:'''  The leathery, highly variable leaves are grey green to olive green, have a lustrous upper surface, and are whitish and densely hairy below.   Leaves are [[Leaf#Arrangement on the stem|alternate]], [[Leaf#Divisions of the lamina (blade)|simple]], with variable [[Leaf shape|shape]] (oblong, ovate, or elliptical), and with wavy or shallowly lobed margins.  Length is 2 to 8&nbsp;cm and width 2 to 4&nbsp;cm.<ref name=OK/>\n\n'''Twigs:'''  Twigs are brown or grayish, 1-2.5&nbsp;mm diameter, glabrous or densely covered with short grayish or yellowish hairs, that are lost with age. Buds are dark red-brown, somewhat spherical, about 2&nbsp;mm long, and sparsely pubescent.\n\n'''Bark:'''  Bark on the larger stems is light gray and scaly.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nShinnery oak populations in Utah and Arizona are considered a variety of shinnery oak ([[Quercus havardii var. tuckeri|''Quercus havardii'' var. ''tuckeri'']]) by some taxonomists.  However, [[introgression]] of shinnery oak with Gambel oak (''[[Quercus gambelii]]'') and perhaps shrub live oak (''[[Quercus turbinella]]'') make taxonomic identification of these populations difficult.<ref name=Gucker/>\n\nShinnery oak hybridizes with Mohr oak (''[[Quercus mohriana]]'') and post oak (''[[Quercus stellata]]''). Post oak \u00d7 shinnery oak hybrids are likely to be a result of post oak's historic range, which extended more westerly than it does today. Mohr oak \u00d7 shinnery oak hybrids are restricted to habitats intermediate to those occupied by the two species. Mohr oak inhabits limestone soils, and shinnery oak occurs on deep sand soils.\n\n==Native range==\nShinnery oak is native to western [[Oklahoma]], west [[Texas]], eastern [[New Mexico]], and 2 isolated populations in southwest [[Kansas]].<ref name=KANU>[http://www.nhm.ku.edu/herbarium/ R.L. McGregor Herbarium. ''Quercus havardii Rydb.'' herbarium records]</ref> A variety also occurs in northeastern [[Arizona]] and southeastern [[Utah]].<ref>[http://www.efloras.org/object_page.aspx?object_id=6796&flora_id=1 Flora of North America. Quercus havardii: Range Map.]</ref> Sandy plains, sand dunes, and sand hills of the southern Great Plains are typical habitat.\n\n==Management==\nA majority of shinnery oak occurs on private land used for agriculture and/or livestock production. It is considered undesirable on grazing lands, because it competes with better livestock forage and its buds and leaves are toxic to cattle for several weeks in spring. In addition, where cotton is grown near shinnery oak, [[Boll Weevil|boll weevils]] overwinter in the oak litter and infest nearby cotton fields in spring.  Thus, most research and other human effort concerning shinnery oak have been devoted to its eradication.\n\nThe use of chemical and mechanical control methods has been extensive, making it likely that shinnery oak's distribution is decreasing.  Most authorities do not recommend complete eradication of shinnery oak, indicating that forage production is typically greater if some shinnery oak remains in the community.  Stocking rates and rotational grazing patterns exist that reduce the incidence of shinnery oak poisoning of cattle.  Excessive control of shinnery oak is controversial because it can open sandy soils to wind erosion and can conflict with wildlife-habitat quality.<ref name=Peterson/>\n\nShinnery oak sprouts prolifically from rhizomes soon after fire.  Researchers described the communities as \"extremely fire hardy\".<ref name=Gucker/>\n\n[[File:Quercus havardii resprouting.jpg|thumb|Quercus havardii resprouting]]\n\n==Uses==\nBecause shinnery oak thrives in a harsh environment, it functions as a sand dune stabilizer, protecting sandy soils from wind erosion.   It also provides diverse wildlife species cover and food. [[Collared peccaries]], [[lesser prairie-chicken]]s, [[northern bobwhite]]s, and many other wildlife species eat shinnery oak acorns.  [[White-tailed deer|Deer]], [[pronghorn]], and [[packrat|southern plains woodrat]]s browse shinnery oak.  Shinnery oak habitats are used by [[black-tailed jackrabbit]]s, [[desert cottontail]]s, [[eastern cottontail]]s, [[wild turkey]]s, [[western box turtle]]s, a diversity of arthropods, approximately 25 [[snake]] species, and approximately 10 [[lizard]] species, including the endangered sand dune lizard (''[[Sceloporus arenicolus]]'').<ref name=Peterson/>\n\nMany game species also rely on shinnery oak.  [[Scaled quail]] and northern bobwhites use shinnery oak habitats extensively, and shinnery oak habitats are considered \"the principal home for white-tailed deer in the southern Great Plains\".<ref name=Peterson/>\n\nShinnery oak provides rich habitat for wildlife compared with the surrounding [[Shortgrass prairie|shortgrass plains]].  Maintaining wildlife habitat and improving vegetation for livestock grazing are often in conflict, and should be carefully considered before undertaking control of shinnery oak.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Quercus havardii}}\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=QUHA3 USDA Plants Profile for ''Quercus havardii'' \u2014 Havard oak.]\n\n[[Category:Quercus|havardii]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Plains-Midwest (United States)]]\n[[Category:Endemic flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]",

Young trees have a smooth, brown bark that becomes gray-black with rough scaly ridges as the tree matures. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, simple and tardily deciduous, remaining on the tree until mid-winter; they are 3\u201312&nbsp;cm (1\u20135&nbsp;in) long and 2\u20136&nbsp;cm (1/2\u20132 in) broad, variable in shape, most commonly shaped like a spatula being broad and rounded at the top and narrow and wedged at the base. The margins vary, usually being smooth to shallowly lobed, with a bristle at the apex and lobe tips. The tree is easy to identify by the leaves, which have a lobe that looks as if a drop of water is hanging from the end of the leaf. The top of each leaf is a dull green to bluish green and the bottom is a paler bluish-green. On the bottom portion of the leaves, rusty colored hairs run along the veins. The [[acorn]]s are arranged singly or in pairs, 10\u201314&nbsp;mm (1/3-1/2 in) long and broad, with a shallow cupule; they mature about 18 months after pollination in [[autumn|fall]] of second year.<ref>[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233501067 Flora of North America: ''Quercus nigra'']</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n[[Image:Quercus nigra.jpg|thumb|left|Water oak leaf cluster]]\nWater oak serves the same ecological role as [[Salix babylonica#Horticultural selections and related hybrids|weeping willow]] and other wetland trees. It is adapted to wet, [[swamp]]y areas, such as along [[pond]]s and stream banks, but can also tolerate well-drained sites and even heavy, compacted soils. It grows in sandy soils, red clays, and old fields to the borders of [[swamp]]s, [[stream]]s, to [[bottomland]]s. Due to its ability to grow and reproduce quickly, the water oak is often the most abundant species in a stand of trees. The tree is relatively short-lived compared to other oaks and may live only 60 to 80 years. It does not compete well and does not tolerate even light shade. Water oak is frequently used to restore bottomland [[hardwood forest]]s on land that was previously cleared for agriculture or pine plantations. Minimum age for flowering and fruiting is 20 years and the tree produces heavy crops of acorns nearly every year. Water oak is not recommended as an ornamental due to being short-lived, disease-prone, and extremely messy.\n\n[[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrids]] of water oak are known with southern red oak (''[[Quercus falcata]]''), bluejack oak (''[[Quercus incana]]''), turkey oak (''[[Quercus laevis]]''), blackjack oak (''[[Quercus marilandica]]''), willow oak (''[[Quercus phellos]]''), Shumard oak (''[[Quercus shumardii]]''), and black oak (''[[Quercus velutina]]'')\n\nWater oak acorns are an important food for [[white-tailed deer]], [[eastern gray squirrel]], [[raccoon]], [[wild turkey]], [[mallard]], [[wood duck]], and [[bobwhite quail]]. In winter, deer will browse the buds and young twigs.\n\n==Uses and history==\nWater oak has been used for timber and for [[firewood|fuel]] by people in the southern states since the 17th century. The wood is generally sold as \"red oak\", mixed with the wood from other red oaks.\n\nOther names include spotted oak, duck oak, punk oak, orange oak or possum oak.\n\n==References==\n{{commons|Quercus nigra}}\n{{reflist}}\n==External links==\n*C.Michael Hogan Ed. 2011.

Ecology. 48(3): 404-419.</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\nSandpaper and Vasey shin oaks are abundant in the [[Edwards Plateau]] and the [[Trans-Pecos]] region of [[Texas]]. They also occur in the [[Guadalupe Mountains]] and westward to the mountains of southeastern [[Arizona]] and southwestern [[New Mexico]], and in northern and eastern Mexico ([[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Coahuila]], [[Durango]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], and [[Veracruz]]).<ref name=USDA/><ref>[http://bonap.net/MapGallery/County/Quercus%20pungens.png Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution map]</ref><ref>[http://swbiodiversity.org/seinet/taxa/index.php?taxon=3246&taxauthid=1 SEINet, Southwestern Biodiversity, Arizona chapter]</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe sandpaper oak can be a small tree of up to 40 feet (12 meters) high or a large shrub that forms thickets. The bark is light brown and papery. The twigs are gray, with short velvety hairs, becoming smooth with age. The buds are dark red-brown, sparsely covered with hairs. The leathery leaves are semi-evergreen, being bright glossy green at first but turning darker with age. It is their rough texture, caused by minute persistent hair bases, that gives the tree its name of sandpaper oak. The [[inflorescence]], which appears in spring, is reddish, the female catkins having one to three flowers and the male catkins numerous flowers. The acorn cups are shallow and covered with dense gray hairs. The acorns grow singly or in pairs and are light brown, broadly ovoid with a rounded apex.<ref name=USDA/><ref name=FNA>[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233501077 Flora of North America]</ref>\n\n==Habitat==\nThe preferred habitat of these oaks is on dry limestone or igneous slopes at a height of 800-2000 meters (2660-6670 feet) above sea level, in [[chaparral]] and desert scrub [[savanna]], usually in communities of [[oak]], [[juniper]] and [[pinyon pine]].<ref name=USDA/> In the chaparral formations in the Guadalupe Mountains, it is one of the dominant species and is found growing alongside true mountain-mahogany, ''[[Cercocarpus montanus]]'' and desert ceanothus, ''[[Ceanothus greggii]]''. Other plants associated with it include the Mohr shin oak, ''[[Quercus mohriana]]'', oneseed juniper, ''[[Juniperus monosperma]]'', cane cholla, ''[[Opuntia imbricata]]'', purplefruited pricklypear, ''[[Opuntia phaeacantha]]'', Mexican buckeye, ''[[Ungnadia speciosa]]'', Texas persimmon, ''[[Diospyros texana]]'', hairy tridens, ''[[Erioneuron pilosum]]'' and plateau oak, ''[[Quercus fusiformis]]''.<ref>Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. 1992.

Gray) Britton & Rose</small>\n|}}\n\n'''''Senegalia greggii''''' is a species of ''[[Senegalia]]'' native to the [[southwestern United States]] and northern [[Mexico]], from the extreme south of [[Utah]] (where, at 37\u00b010' N it is the northernmost naturally occurring ''Senegalia'' species anywhere in the world{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}) south through southern [[Nevada]], southeast [[California]], [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]] and western [[Texas]] to [[Baja California]], [[Sinaloa]] and [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]] in Mexico.\n\nCommon names include '''catclaw acacia''', '''catclaw mesquite''', '''Gregg's catclaw''', '''paradise flower''', '''wait-a-minute bush''', and '''wait-a-bit tree'''; these names mostly come from the fact that the tree has numerous hooked '''prickles''' with the shape and size of a [[cat]]'s claw, that tend to hook onto passers-by; the hooked person must stop (\"wait a minute\") to remove the '''prickles''' carefully to avoid injury or shredded clothing. (Note: \"cat's claw\" is also used to refer to ''[[Uncaria tomentosa]]'', a woody vine found in the tropical jungles of South and Central America)\n\nThe [[Botanical name|specific epithet]] ''greggii'' refers to [[Josiah Gregg]], author, explorer, and amateur naturalist of the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] and northern Mexico.\n\n==Ecology==\n''Senegalia greggii'' is most common in [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] where its roots have access to deep water. Its seeds require physical [[Scarification (botany)|scarification]] in order to germinate. This effectively prevents [[germination]] unless a [[flash flood]] disturbs the area and deposits enough water to increase the likelihood that seedlings will be able to establish deep enough roots to survive the dry season. Catclaw is fully [[drought]] [[deciduous]] and will usually lack [[Leaf|leaves]] for most of the year. ''S. greggii'' has [[Extrafloral nectary|extrafloral nectaries]], a trait shared with other senegalias. A tentative connection has been made between these glands and [[insect]]s that would suggest a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship (as found in other ''Senegalia'' species).  [[Ant]]s are known to use the glands as a source of food and water, and may provide some defense for the plant against [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] insects. Like other arroyo trees in family [[Fabaceae]], ''S. greggii'' is frequently afflicted with Desert Mistletoe, ''[[Phoradendron]] [[Phoradendron californicum|californicum]]''. Unlike other legumes, ''S. greggii'' is not known to form [[root nodule]] associations with [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[Diazotroph|bacteria]].\n\nIt is argued that this species may be an example of an evolutionary [[anachronism]], in which the range and renewal of the species is limited due to the [[Quaternary extinction event#The Pleistocene or Ice Age extinction event|extinction]] of the mammalian [[megafauna]] responsible for [[Endozoochory|seed dispersal]]. Within this model, the scarification required to germinate the seeds would have occurred during the chewing and [[digestion]] of the fruit by a large [[mammal]], who later passes the seed intact some distance from the original tree.\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Acacia greggii1.jpg|thumb|200px|<div style=\"text-align:center;\">''Senegalia greggii''</div>]]\nIt is a large [[shrub]] or small [[tree]] growing to {{convert|10|-|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall with a trunk up to {{convert|20|-|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter. The grey-green [[leaf|leaves]] are [[deciduous]], and bipinnate, divided into 1-3 pairs of pinnae, each pinna {{convert|2|-|3|cm|abbr=on}} long with 10-18 [[leaflet (botany)|leaflets]] that are {{convert|3|-|6|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Pinnae are most frequently in two pairs, with the proximal pair perpendicular to the petiolule and the distal pair forming a V at the tip.  \n\nThe blooms are produced in dense cylindrical spikes of numerous flowers, each individual flower with five cream colored {{convert|3|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[petal]]s and numerous creamy yellow {{convert|6|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[stamen]]s. The [[fruit]] is a flat, twisted [[legume]] (pod) {{convert|6|-|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, containing generally 3 to 5 hard, flattened, medium brown [[seed]]s.  The seed pod is constricted between seeds (a [[loment]]), and [[seed dispersal]] occurs both through [[Dehiscence (botany)|dehiscence]] and breaks at these constrictions.\n\n==Ethnobotany==\n''Senegalia greggii'', even though it is used as [[Fodder|forage]] for livestock, contains a potentially poisonous [[cyanogenic glycoside]] called [[prunasin]].<ref>[http://www.ivis.org/special_books/Knight/chap1/ivis.pdf Plants Causing Sudden Death by A. P. Knight and R. G. Walter]</ref>  Mature seeds are to be avoided, as the native people did. ''S. greggii'' young, unripe beans were gathered and eaten by desert [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|tribes]] of [[North America]], including the [[Chemehuevi]] of the [[Southern Paiute]], the [[Pima people|Pima]], and the [[Cahuilla]]. The Cahuilla also ground the dried beans for mush and cakes, while the [[Havasupai]] ground it to make flour for bread. The [[Seri people|Seri]] ground the beans to meal then mixed it with water and sea lion oil for [[porridge]]. The [[Diegueno]] used ''S. greggii'' as food for domesticated animals. \n\nThe Cahuilla and Pima used the fibers for sturdy construction material and firewood. The Havasupai split the twigs and used them for [[basketry]], but also used the twigs as a broom to brush off [[metate|metates]]. The O'odham (formerly called [[Tohono O'odham|Papago]]) used the broken twigs for baskets, and were curved to make intricate weaves in the baskets. The Pima used the dried bushes to pile them to make a brush fence. The branches were used to make cradle frames as well. \n\nThe Tohono O'odham fitted the branches around deer hunters' heads to make a disguise, and the buds and blossoms were dried to make perfume sachets by the women. The sticks were also used to dislodge [[saguaro]] fruits from the [[cactus]] body, and rods were curved to flesh animal skins. The Akimel O'odham made bows out of the wood.<ref name=\"U Michigan Native American Ethnobotany\">{{cite web|title=Acacia greggii Gray|url=http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl|website=http://herb.umd.umich.edu/|accessdate=2015}}</ref>\n[[Image:Acacia-greggii-flower.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Senegalia greggii'' Flower]]\n\n==Some chemical compounds found in ''Senegalia greggii''==\n*[[Beta-methyl-phenethylamine]]<ref name=\"chem\">[http://uvalde.tamu.edu/pdf/chemtdaf.pdf Chemistry of Acacias from South Texas]</ref>\n*[[Catechin]]<ref name=\"chem\"/>\n*[[Fisetin]]<ref name=\"chem\"/>\n*[[Hordenine]]<ref name=\"chem\"/>\n*[[Phenethylamine]]<ref name=\"chem\"/>\n*[[Quercetin]]<ref name=\"chem\"/>\n*[[Tyramine]]<ref name=\"chem\"/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Acacia greggii branch.jpg|<center>''Senegalia greggii'' branch</center>\nImage:Acacia greggii seeds.jpg|<center>''Senegalia greggii'' seeds</center>\nImage:Acacia greggii2.jpg|<center>Catclaw Acacia thorn</center>\nImage:Acacia-greggii-bark.jpg|<center>Bark</center>\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===General references===\n* Barlow, C.

The [[bark]] is gray-brown to red-brown, thin and fibrous with a stringy texture, having a vertically interwoven pattern of shallow ridges and narrow furrows. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate and linear, with flat blades borne on the [[branch|twig]] that are spirally arranged on the stem, but twisted at the base to lie in two horizontal ranks, 1\u20132&nbsp;cm long and 1\u20132&nbsp;mm broad.  Unlike most other species in the family Cupressaceae, it is [[deciduous]], losing its leaves in the winter months, hence the name 'bald'. It is [[Plant sexuality#Individual plant sexuality|monoecious]] (separate staminate and carpellate flowers are always found on the same plant), with male and female flowers forming on slender tassel-like structures near the edge of the branchlets. The male and female [[strobili]] are produced from buds formed in the late fall, with pollination in early winter, and mature in about 12 months. The [[conifer cone|seed cones]] are green maturing gray-brown, globular, and 2-3.5&nbsp;cm in diameter. They have from 20 to 30 spirally arranged, four-sided scales, each bearing one or two (rarely three) triangular [[seed]]s. The number of seeds per cone ranges from 20 to 40. The cones disintegrate when mature to release the large seeds. The seeds are 5\u201310&nbsp;mm long, the largest of any species in the cypress family, and are produced every year, but with heavy crops every three to five years. The seedlings have three to 9 (most often six) [[cotyledon]]s.<ref name=farjon/>\n\nThe main trunks are surrounded by [[cypress knees]].\n\nThe tallest known individual specimen, near [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], is 44.11 m tall, and the stoutest known, in the [[Cat Island National Wildlife Refuge]] near [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], has a [[diameter at breast height]] (DBH) of 521&nbsp;cm.<ref name=gd/> The oldest known specimen, located in [[Bladen County, North Carolina]], is over 1,620 years old, making this one of the oldest living plants in eastern North America.<ref>http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~adk/oldlisteast/Spp/TADI.html</ref>\n\n{{Gallery\n|File:Bald Cypress Leaves 2264px.jpg|Foliage\n|File:Baldcypress cone.jpg|Cones\n|File:Bald Cypress Taxodium distichum Fingers.JPG|Knees\n|File:Bald Cypress Taxodium distichum Bark Vertical.JPG|Bark\n}}\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe closely related ''[[Taxodium ascendens]]'' (pond cypress) is treated by some botanists as a distinct species,<ref name=usda>USDA Plants Profiles: [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=TADI2 ''Taxodium distichum''], [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=TAAS ''Taxodium ascendens'']</ref> while others classify it as merely a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of bald-cypress,<ref name=farjon/><ref name=gd/> as ''Taxodium distichum'' var. ''imbricatum'' (Nutt.) Croom. It differs in shorter leaves borne on erect shoots, and in ecology, being largely confined to low-nutrient [[blackwater river|blackwater]] habitats. A few authors also treat ''[[Taxodium mucronatum]]'' as a variety of bald cypress, as ''T. distichum'' var. ''mexicanum'' Gordon, thereby considering the genus as comprising only one species.<ref name=fna1>{{eFloras|1|132353|Taxodium}}</ref>\n\n==Habitat==\n[[Image:Bald Cypress.JPG|thumb|left|Bald cypress in [[Trap Pond State Park]], [[Delaware]]]]\n\n=== Range ===\n[[File:Baldcypress range.jpg|thumb|right|Bald cypress range]]\n[[File:Caddo Lake- Cypress.jpg|thumb|right|Bald cypress on the [[Texas]] side of [[Caddo Lake]]]]\n\nThe native range extends from [[Delaware Bay]] south to Florida and west to East Texas and southeastern Oklahoma, and also inland up the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers north to southern Illinois. The oldest found reside in [[North Carolina]], but older ones may exist elsewhere. Mature planted specimens are seen as far north as [[Pittsburgh]],<ref>http://www.pittsburghforest.org/userfiles/file/Lawrenceville%20Tree%20of%20the%20Month/LV_Tree_of_Month_03_Bald_Cypress.pdf</ref> and Ottawa, Ontario.<ref>{{cite book|title=For the Love of Trees|author=Richard Hinchcliff|pages=52\u201353|isbn=978-1-897113-73-8|publisher=General Store Publishing |date=2007}}</ref> In Ottawa, in the Central Experimental Farm Arboretum, an average winter may kill back a quarter to half of new growth. Ancient bald cypress [[forest]]s, with some trees more than 1,700 years old, once dominated [[swamp]]s in the southeast US. The largest remaining old-growth stands are at [[Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary]], near [[Naples, Florida|Naples]], [[Florida]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} and in the Three Sisters tract along eastern North Carolina's [[Black River (North Carolina)|Black River]]. The Corkscrew trees are around 500 years of age and some exceed 40 m in height. The Black River trees were cored by David Stahle from the [[University of Arkansas]]. He is a [[dendrochronologist]] and his dates range back to 364 AD.<ref>{{cite web\n   |url=http://www.pocosinpress.com/Methuselah.pdf\n   |format=PDF|title=Searching for Methuselah\n   |pages= 1\u20133\n   |author=Paul Ferguson\n   |year=2008\n   |publisher=Pocosin Press\n   |accessdate=21 April 2011\n}}</ref> In the northern and more inland part of its range from Delaware and Maryland to Williamsburg, Virginia, it is found in groups growing in swamps and is accompanied by other hardwoods. In the southern parts of its range from extreme southeastern Virginia, [[Virginia Beach]] south to Florida and west to Texas, bald cypress can be found growing with [[loblolly pine]] and [[live oak]], and it may be heavily covered in [[Spanish moss]]. This can be observed in the far northern part of its range at [[First Landing State Park]], Virginia Beach, Virginia. From eastern North Carolina down throughout Florida and over to southeast and south Texas, bald cypress may be accompanied in forests by [[sabal minor|dwarf palmetto]].\n\nIt is native to humid climates where annual precipitation ranges from about 760&nbsp;mm (in Texas) to 1630&nbsp;mm (along the Gulf Coast). Although it grows best in warm climates, the natural northern limit of the species is not due to a lack of cold tolerance, but to specific reproductive requirements; further north, regeneration is prevented by [[ice]] damage to seedlings. Larger trees are able to tolerate much lower temperatures and lower humidity.\n\nIn 2012 [[Scuba diving|Scuba]] divers discovered an underwater forest several miles off the coast of Mobile, AL in 60 feet of water. The forest contains trees that could not be dated with radiocarbon methods since they are older than 50,000 years old, thus most likely lived in the early glacial interval of the last ice age. The forest contains trees so well-preserved that when they are cut, they still smell like fresh cypress. The team, which has not yet published their results in a peer-reviewed journal, is currently studying the site. It is estimated that they have less than two years before wood-burrowing marine animals destroy the submerged forest.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Primeval Underwater Forest Discovered in Gulf of Mexico|url=http://www.livescience.com/37977-underwater-cypress-forest-discovered.html|publisher=Live Science|accessdate=11 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Soils and topography ===\nMost bald cypress trees grow on flat ground on [[alluvium|alluvial]] soils, usually at elevations of less than 50 m above sea level, although some stands may occur at elevations of 500 m in Texas.\n\nBald cypress occurs mainly along [[riparian]] (riverside) wetlands normally subject to periodic flooding by silt-rich 'brownwater' rivers, unlike the related ''[[Taxodium ascendens]]'', which occurs in silt-poor [[blackwater river]]s and [[pond]]s. ''T. distichum'' tolerates minor salinity, but does not grow in brackish or saline coastal waters.\n\n==Reproduction and early growth==\n[[File:2014-11-02 14 12 30 Bald Cypress foliage during autumn along Hunters Ridge Drive in Hopewell Township, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|right|Foliage in autumn just before shedding]]\nBald cypress is [[Monoecious#Plant population|monoecious]]. Male and female strobili mature in one growing season from buds formed the previous year. The male catkins are about {{convert|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and are borne in slender, purplish, drooping clusters {{convert|7|to|13|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long that are conspicuous during the winter on this deciduous conifer. Pollen is shed in March and April. Female conelets are found singly or in clusters of two or three. The globose cones turn from green to brownish-purple as they mature from October to December. The cones are {{convert|13|to|36|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and consist of 9 to 15 four-sided scales that break away irregularly after maturity. Each scale can bear two irregular, triangular seeds with thick, horny, warty coats and projecting flanges.<ref>Faulkner, Stephen P. 1982.

Personal communication. National Audubon Society, Francis Beidler Forest, Harleyville, SC.</ref> Floodwaters spread the scales or cones along streams and are the most important means of seed dissemination.<ref name=\"Agriculture, Forest Service 1965\"/>\n\n===Seedling development===\n[[Germination]] is [[epigeal germination|epigeal]].<ref name=\"Agriculture, Forest Service 1974\"/> Under swamp conditions, germination generally takes place on a sphagnum moss or a wet-muck seedbed. Seeds will not germinate under water, but some will remain viable for 30 months under water. On the other hand, seeds usually fail to germinate on better drained soils because of the lack of surface water. Thus, a soil saturated but not flooded for a period of one to three months after seedfall is required for germination.<ref name=\"Agriculture, Forest Service 1965\"/>\n\n[[File:Bald Cypress swamp and Spanish Moss.jpg|thumb|left|Bald cypress swamp and Spanish moss at First Landing State Park in Virginia Beach, VA]]After germination, seedlings must grow fast enough to keep at least part of their crowns above floodwaters for most of the growing season.<ref>Conner, William H, 1988, Natural and artificial regeneration of baldcypress [Taxodium distichum (L.)

Nursery beds are sown in spring with pretreated seeds or in fall with untreated seeds. Seedlings usually reach {{convert|75|to|100|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in height during their first (and usually only) year in the nursery. Average size of 1-0 nursery-grown seedlings in a seed source test including 72 families was {{convert|81.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|1.1|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.\n\nControl of competing vegetation may be necessary for a year or more for bald cypress planted outside of swamps. Five years after planting on a harrowed and bedded, poorly drained site in Florida, survival was high, but heights had increased only {{convert|30|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}, probably because of heavy herbaceous competition. Seedlings grown in a crawfish pond in Louisiana, where weed control and soil moisture were excellent through June, averaged {{convert|2.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|3.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter at breast height (DBH) after five years. However, a replicate of the same sources planted on an old soybean field, where weed control and soil moisture were poor, resulted in the same DBH, but a smaller average seedling height of {{convert|2.1|m|ft|abbr=on}}<!-- (John R. Toliver, unpublished data)-->. When planted in a residential yard and weeded and watered, they averaged {{convert|3.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall three years later.\n\n===Vegetative reproduction===\n\nBald cypress is one of the few conifer species that sprouts. Thrifty sprouts are generally produced from stumps of young trees, but trees up to 60 years old also send up healthy sprouts if the trees are cut during the fall or winter. However, survival of these sprouts is often poor and those that live are usually poorly shaped and do not make quality sawtimber trees. Stumps of trees up to 200 years old may also sprout, but the sprouts are not as vigorous and are more subject to wind damage as the stump decays. In the only report on the rooting of bald cypress cuttings found in the literature, cuttings from trees five years old rooted better than those from older trees.\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Bald cypress Atchafalaya Basin.jpg|left|thumb|125px|A bald cypress in the Atchafalaya Basin of Louisiana]]\n[[File:Bald cypress knees in duckweed.JPG|thumb|left|125px|Bald cypress knees in [[duckweed]]]]\nThe seeds remain viable for less than one year, and are dispersed in two ways. One is by water; the seeds float and move on water until flooding recedes or the cone is deposited on shore. The second is by wildlife; [[squirrel]]s eat seeds, but often drop some scales from the cones they harvest. Seeds do not germinate under water and rarely germinate on well-drained soils; seedlings normally become established on continuously saturated, but not flooded, soils for one to three months. After germination, seedlings must grow quickly to escape floodwaters; they often reach a height of 20\u201375&nbsp;cm (up to 100&nbsp;cm in fertilized [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] conditions) in their first year. Seedlings die if inundated for more than about two to four weeks. Natural regeneration is therefore prevented on sites that are always flooded during the growing season. Although vigorous saplings and stump sprouts can produce viable seed, most specimens do not produce seed until they are about 30 years old. In good conditions, Bald-cypress grows fairly fast when young, then more slowly with age. Trees have been measured to reach 3 m in five years, 21 m in 41 years, and 36 m in height in 96 years; height growth has largely ceased by the time the trees are 200 years old. Some individuals can live over 1,000 years. Determination of the age of an old tree may be difficult because of frequent missing or false [[growth ring|ring]]s of stemwood caused by variable and stressful growing environments.\n\n[[File:Cypress 8001.JPG|thumb|Bald cypress forest in winter, showing \"knees\" and (brown) high flood level, Lynches River, [[Johnsonville, South Carolina]]]]\nBald cypress trees growing in swamps have a peculiarity of growth called [[cypress knee]]s. These are woody projections from the root system project above the ground or water. Their function was once thought to be to provide [[oxygen]] to the roots, which grow in the low dissolved oxygen (DO) waters typical of a swamp (as in [[mangrove]]s). However, evidence for this is scant; in fact, roots of swamp-dwelling specimens whose knees are removed do not decrease in oxygen content and the trees continue to thrive. Another more likely function is structural support and stabilization. Bald cypress trees growing on flood-prone sites tend to form buttressed bases, but trees grown on drier sites may lack this feature. Buttressed bases and a strong, intertwined root system allow them to resist very strong winds; even [[hurricane]]s rarely overturn them.<ref name=usfs>U.S. Forest Service Silvics Manual: [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/Volume_1/taxodium/distichum.htm ''Taxodium distichum'']</ref>\n\nMany agents damage ''T. distichum'' trees. The main damaging (in some cases lethal) agent is the [[fungus]] ''Stereum taxodii'', which causes a brown pocket rot known as \"pecky cypress\". It attacks the heartwood of living trees, usually from the crown down to the roots. A few other fungi attack the sapwood and the heartwood of the tree, but they do not usually cause serious damage. [[Insect]]s such as the cypress flea beetle (''Systena marginalis'') and the bald cypress leafroller (''Archips goyerana'') (closely related to the [[Archips argyrospila|fruit tree leafroller]]) can seriously damage trees by destroying leaves, cones or the bark. [[Coypu|Nutrias]] also clip and unroot young bald cypress seedlings, sometimes killing a whole plantation in a short amount of time.<ref name=usfs/>\n\n==Conservation==\nIn 2002, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources identified ''T distichum'' as a state protected plant with the status of Threatened.\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[File:Taxodium distichum02.jpg|thumb|right|<center>Timber]]\nThis species is a popular [[ornamental tree]], grown for its light, feathery foliage and orange-brown to dull red fall color. In cultivation, it thrives on a wide range of soils, including well-drained sites where it would not grow naturally due to the inability of the young seedlings to compete with other vegetation. Cultivation is successful far to the north of its native range, north to southern Canada. It is also commonly planted in Europe, Asia and elsewhere with [[temperateness|temperate]] to [[subtropical]] climates. It does, however, require hot summers for good growth; when planted in areas with cool summers [[oceanic climate]]s, growth is healthy but very slow (some in northeastern England have only reached 4\u20135 m tall in about 50 years),<ref>Tree Register of the British Isles</ref> and cones are not produced.\n\nOne of the oldest in Europe, was planted in the 1900s in the [[Arboretum de P\u00e9zanin]], Burgundy, France.\n\nBald cypress has been noted for its high merchantable yields. In virgin stands, yields from 112 to 196 m\u00b3/ha were common, and some stands might have exceeded 1000 m\u00b3/ha. Bald cypress swamps are some of the world's most productive ecosystems.\n\nThe odorless wood of bald cypress, closely resembling that of ''[[Cupressus]]'' spp., has long been valued for its water resistance, thus is called 'wood eternal'. Still-usable prehistoric wood is often found in swamps as far north as New Jersey, and occasionally as far as Connecticut, although it is more common in the southeast. The somewhat-mineralized wood is mined from some swamps in the southeast, and is highly prized for specialty uses such as wood carvings. Pecky cypress, caused by the fungus ''Stereum taxodii'' is used for decorative wall [[paneling]].\n\nThe bald cypress was designated the official [[list of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[Louisiana]] in 1963.<ref>{{cite book|title=Louisiana Almanac, 2006-2007|page=431|last1=Calhoun|first1=Milburn|last2=Frois|first2=Jeanne|isbn=978-1-58980-307-7|publisher=Pelican Publishing|edition=17th|date=31 May 2006}}</ref>  It is considered by some to be a symbol of the southern swamps.\n\nCypress trees can be used in the making of shingles. [[Joshua Brown (Texas pioneer)|Joshua D. Brown]], the first settler of [[Kerrville, Texas|Kerrville]], [[Texas]], made his living producing shingles from cypress trees growing along the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] of the [[Texas Hill Country]].<ref>Historical marker, Texas Historical Commission, [[Kerrville, Texas|Kerrville]], [[Texas]], 1971</ref> Shingles produced from cypress were also one of the main industries for early pioneers in Kissimmee, Florida (near Walt Disney World).

The distribution and description above treat the species in its narrow sense; taken in the broad sense, including plants with the leaves white below with dense tomentum (velvety hairs), the distribution extends southwards to [[Florida]], and in [[Mexico]] west to [[Sinaloa]] and south to [[Oaxaca]].\n\n== Ecology ==\nAmerican basswood is dominant in the [[sugar maple\u2013basswood forest association]], which is most common in western [[Wisconsin]] and central [[Minnesota]], but occurs as far east as [[New England]] and southern [[Quebec]] in places that have [[mesic habitat|mesic]] soil with relatively high [[soil pH|pH]]. It also has minor occurrence in many other forest cover types.\n\nIts flowers provide abundant nectar for insects. The seeds are eaten by [[chipmunk]]s, [[mice]], and [[squirrel]]s. [[Rabbit]]s and [[vole]]s eat the bark, sometimes girdling young trees. The leaves serve as food for [[caterpillar]]s of various [[Lepidoptera]] (see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on Tilia|Lepidoptera which feed on ''Tilia'']]). The [[Bucculatricidae|ribbed cocoon maker]] species ''[[Bucculatrix improvisa]]'' has not been found on other plants.\n\nThis species is particularly susceptible to adult [[Japanese beetle]]s (an [[invasive species]] in North America) that feed on its leaves.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=USDA |title=Managing the Japanese Beetle:A Homeowner\u2019s Handbook |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/plant_health/content/printable_version/JB3-07.indd.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Cultivation and uses ==\n[[File:Tilia americana sections.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Sections of ''Tilia americana'' from ''[[The American Woods]]'']]\nThe American basswood can be propagated by cuttings and grafting as well as by seed.  The plants grow rapidly in a rich soil, but are subject to the attacks of many insect enemies.\n\nThe American basswood is known for being one of the most difficult native North American trees to propagate from seed, as they not only have a low viability rate (approximately 30% of all seeds are viable), but quickly develop an extremely hard seed coating that may delay germination for up to two years. If planting them, it is recommended to gather the seeds in early autumn and sow them before they dry out and form a coating. This will then allow germination to occur immediately. Overall, seeds are not a major part of the tree's reproductive strategy and it instead mostly spreads by self-coppicing. All juvenile basswoods [[coppice]] extremely readily, and even old trees will often sprout from the stump if cut.\n\nThe American basswood is recommended as an ornamental tree when the mass of foliage or a deep shade is desired; no native tree surpasses it in this respect. It is often planted on the windward side of an orchard as a protection to young and delicate trees.<ref name=Keeler /> It is cultivated at least as far north as [[Juneau, Alaska]].<ref>Juneau: [http://www.silverbowinn.com/downtown_tree_guide%20final%2006.pdf Downtown Juneau Tree Guide] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818004459/http://www.silverbowinn.com/downtown_tree_guide%20final%2006.pdf |date=August 18, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe foliage and flowers are both edible, though many prefer only to eat the tender young leaves. It is a beneficial species for attracting pollinators as well. Bees produce excellent honey with a mildly spicy flavor from its blossoms.\n\n[[Cultivar]]s include 'Nova', 'Duros' (with an upright crown), the pyramidal 'Frontyard' and the conic-crowned 'Redmond'.\n\n=== Wood ===\n[[File:Natural Basswood Cat Statuette.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|basswood carving]]\nThe wood is pale brown, sometimes nearly white or faintly tinged with red; light, soft with fine close grain; clear of knots but does not split easily. It is low in strength and has a poor steam-bending classification. It can take stains and polish without difficulty and it planes, glues, screws and nails well.<ref>{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Terry |date=2006 |title=Wood Identification & Use \u2013 Revised & Expanded |page=254}}</ref> It is sold generally under the name basswood, but is sometimes confounded with tulip-wood and then called white-wood, and is largely used in the manufacture of wooden-ware, wagon boxes and furniture. It has a [[density]] of 0.4525. The wood is considered odorless. This makes it valuable in the manufacture of wooden-ware, cheap furniture, bodies of carriages; it is also especially adapted for wood-carving. The inner bark is very tough and fibrous, used in the past for making ropes.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nIt is a common wood for use in the production of solid body electric guitars, where it is considered an analogue for aspen and poplar, because it is light, strong and resonant, though it is usually used for guitars that will be painted an opaque color, because its lack of notable grain makes it an unattractive candidate for transparent finish. Linden wood rots easily and old trees have many cavities that serve as nesting places for birds.\n\n=== Medicinal uses ===\nAlthough ''[[Tilia cordata]]'' is believed to be stronger, ''T. americana'' is also used medicinally. The dried flowers are mildly sweet and sticky, and the fruit is somewhat sweet and mucilaginous. Linden tea has a pleasing taste, due to the aromatic volatile oil found in the flowers. The flowers, leaves, wood, and charcoal (obtained from the wood) are used for medicinal purposes. Active ingredients in the linden flowers include [[flavonoid]]s (which act as [[antioxidant]]s), volatile oils, and mucilaginous constituents (which soothe and reduce inflammation). The plant also contains [[tannin]]s that can act as an [[astringent]].<ref name=bradley>{{citation |editor-first=Bradley |editor-last=P |encyclopedia=British Herbal Compendium |volume=I |place=Dorset (Great Britain |publisher=British Herbal Medicine Association |date=1992 |pages=142\u2013144}}</ref>\n\nLinden flowers are used in colds, cough, fever, infections, inflammation, high blood pressure, headache (particularly migraine), as a diuretic (increases urine production), antispasmodic (reduces smooth muscle spasm along the digestive tract), and sedative. The flowers were added to baths to quell hysteria, and steeped as a tea to relieve anxiety-related indigestion, irregular heartbeat, and vomiting. The leaves are used to promote sweating to reduce fevers. The wood is used for liver and gallbladder disorders and cellulitis (inflammation of the skin and surrounding soft tissue). That wood burned to charcoal is ingested to treat intestinal disorders and used topically to treat edema or infection, such as cellulitis or ulcers of the lower leg.<ref name=bradley /><ref name=\"mice\"/>\n\nSeveral animal studies showed that the extract of ''T. americana'' increased sleeping time with 50 minutes (similar to the effects of [[diazepam]]) and decreased movement, which indicates sedative effects.<ref name=\"mice\">{{Cite journal|last=Aguirre-Hern\u00e1ndez|first=E.|last2=Mart\u00ednez|first2=A.

However, a study published in 2011 by the [[Agricultural Research Service]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] revealed that about 20% of wild American elms are [[diploid]], and may even constitute another species. Moreover, several triploid trees known only in cultivation, such as [[Ulmus americana 'Jefferson'|'Jefferson']], are possessed of a high degree of resistance to [[Dutch elm disease]] which ravaged American elms in the 20th century. This suggests that the diploid parent trees, which have markedly smaller cells than the tetraploid, may too be highly resistant to the disease.<ref name=Whittemore>Whittemore, A. & Olsen, R. (2011).

No subspecies or varieties are currently recognized within the species.\n\n==Description==\n\nThe American elm is a [[deciduous]] [[hermaphroditic]] [[tree]] which, before the introduction of Dutch elm disease, commonly grew to > 30&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft) tall with a trunk > 1.2&nbsp;m (4&nbsp;ft) [[diameter at breast height|d.b.h]] supporting a high, spreading umbrella-like canopy. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, 7&ndash;20&nbsp;cm long, with double-serrate margins and an oblique base. The [[perfect flower]]s are small, purple-brown and, being wind-pollinated, [[apetalous]]. The flowers are also [[protogynous]], the female parts maturing before the male, thus reducing, but not eliminating, self-fertilization,<ref name=\"Hans\">{{cite journal|last=Hans|first=A.

The [[fruit]] is a flat [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] 2&nbsp;cm long by 1.5&nbsp;cm broad, with a circular papery wing surrounding the single 4\u20135&nbsp;mm [[seed]]. As in the closely related [[Ulmus laevis|European White Elm ''Ulmus laevis'']], the flowers and seeds are borne on 1&ndash;3&nbsp;cm long stems. American Elm is wholly insensitive to daylight length ([[photoperiod]]), and will continue to grow well into autumn until injured by frost.<ref name=\"Downs\">{{cite journal|last1=Downs|first1=R.

However, the condition is far less serious, and afflicted trees should recover the following year.\n\n===Dutch elm disease===\n{{Main article|Dutch elm disease}}\nDutch elm disease (DED) is a [[fungus|fungal]] [[disease]] which has ravaged the American elm, causing catastrophic die-offs in cities across the range. It has been estimated that only approximately 1 in 100,000 American elm trees is DED-tolerant, most known survivors simply having escaped exposure to the disease.<ref name=\"DEDresistance\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jul96/elms0796.htm|title=New American Elms Restore Stately Trees|publisher=Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture|date=July 1996|accessdate=December 18, 2014}}</ref> However, in some areas still not populated by Dutch elm disease, the American elm continues to thrive, notably in [[Florida]], [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]].\n\nThe American elm is particularly susceptible to disease because the period of infection often coincides with the period, approximately 30 days, of rapid terminal growth when new springwood vessels are fully functional. Spores introduced outside of this period remain largely static within the [[xylem]] and are thus relatively ineffective.<ref name=Smalley>{{cite journal|last=Smalley|first=E. G.|year=1963|title=Seasonal Fluctuations in Susceptibility of Young Elm Seedlings to Dutch Elm Disease|journal=Phytopathology|volume=53|issue=7|pages= 846\u2013853}}</ref>\n\nThe American elm's biology in some ways has helped to spare it from obliteration by the Dutch elm disease, in contrast to what happened to the [[American chestnut]] with the [[chestnut blight]]. The elm's seeds are largely wind-dispersed, and the tree grows quickly and begins bearing seeds at a young age. It grows well along roads or railroad tracks, and in abandoned lots and other disturbed areas, where it is highly tolerant of most stress factors. Elms have been able to survive and to reproduce in areas where the disease had eliminated old trees, although most of these young elms eventually succumb to the disease at a relatively young age. There is some reason to hope that these elms will preserve the genetic diversity of the original population, and that they eventually will hybridize with DED-resistant varieties that have been developed or that occur naturally. After 20 years of research, American scientists first developed DED-resistant strains of elms in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"DEDresistance\" />\n\nFungicidal injections can be administered to valuable American elms, to prevent infection. Such injections generally are effective as a preventive measure for up to three years when performed before any symptoms have appeared, but may be ineffective once the disease is evident.\n\n==Cultivation==\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, American elm was a common street and park tree owing to its tolerance of urban conditions, rapid growth, and graceful form. This however led to extreme overplanting of the species, especially to form living archways over streets, which ultimately produced an unhealthy [[monoculture]] of elms that had no resistance to disease and pests.<ref name=\"Stennes\">{{cite journal| last=Stennes | first=Mark | year=2003 | title=Good News for the American Elm | journal=Shade Tree Advocate | volume=5 | issue=4 | page=6 |accessdate=December 19, 2014}}</ref> These trees' rapid growth and longevity, leading to great size within decades, also favored its horticultural use before the advent of Dutch elm disease.<ref Name=Werthner/> Ohio botanist William B. Werthner, discussing the contrast between open-grown and forest-grown American elms, noted that:  \n<blockquote>\nIn the open, with an abundance of air and light, the main trunk divides into several leading branches which leave the trunk at a sharp angle and continue to grow upward, gradually diverging, dividing and subdividing into long, flexible branchlets whose ends, at last, float lightly in the air, giving the tree a round, somewhat flattened top of beautifully regular proportions and characteristically fine twiggery.<ref name=Werthner />\n</blockquote>\n\nIt is this distinctive growth form that is so valued in the open-grown American elms of street plantings, lawns, and parks; along most narrower streets, elms planted on opposite sides arch and blend together into a leafy canopy over the pavement. However, elms can assume many different sizes and forms depending on the location and climate zone, and the classic vase-like shape is far from the norm in naturally occurring (as opposed to cultivated) specimens.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"px\" heights=\"px\">\nFile:NIE 1905 Elm.jpg|Early photos of New England American elms, showing growth patterns, ''The New International Encyclop\u00e6dia'' (1905).\nFile:Lafayette Street, Salem, MA.jpg|Lafayette Street, Salem, MA.: 'high-tunnel effect' of ''U. americana'' avenues once common in New England.\nFile:American Elm, Western Massachusetts - September 2016.jpg|Surviving American elm \"street tree\" in western Massachusetts (2016).\nFile:PSM V78 D424 An old cambridge landmark.png|''Ulmus americana'' as campus elm: Cambridge, Massachusetts\nFile:Massachusetts American Elm 1 - May 2012.jpg|American elm, Massachusetts (2012).

Leaf fall is late, often in early winter. The wind-pollinated [[apetalous]] [[perfect flower]]s are produced in the late summer or early fall; they are small and inconspicuous, with a reddish-purple color.

The tree also suffers from a vascular wilt, the symptoms often confused with those of DED.\n\nCedar elms are very susceptible to [[Phoradendron tomentosum|mistletoe]].  Mistletoe is a parasite that roots itself in to the vascular system of the tree, thus stealing valuable nutrients and water.  In some cases, if not removed the parasite can be devastating to large sections of trees and even fatal.  They create club like branches that die out at the ends.  These \"club\" branches create openings for future pests like the elm beetles and carpenter ants.  There are no known treatments that are safe enough to kill mistletoe without killing the tree.  Removing the mistletoe manually is not a guarantee, however it is the best known method for control.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n==Cultivation==\nOwing to Dutch elm disease, the cedar elm is now rarely cultivated in North America.
