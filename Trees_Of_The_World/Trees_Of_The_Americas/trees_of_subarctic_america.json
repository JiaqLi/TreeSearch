''B. resinifera'') or '''Alaska Birch''', also known as '''Alaska Paper Birch''' or '''Resin Birch''', is a species of [[birch]] native to [[Alaska]] and northern [[Canada]]. Its range covers most of interior Alaska, and extends from the southern [[Brooks Range]] to the [[Chugach Range]] in Alaska, including the [[Turnagain Arm]] and northern half of the [[Kenai Peninsula]], easterward from [[Norton Sound]] into western [[Ontario]], and north to [[Northwest Territories]] and southern [[Nunavut]].\n\nThis tree typically grows to {{convert|15|-|20|m|abbr=on}} tall, occasionally up to {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}}, and achieves a trunk diameter of {{convert|30|-|50|cm|abbr=on}}, and sometimes to more than {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}}. It grows in a variety of habitats, from wetlands to ridgetops at altitudes of {{convert|100|-|1200|m|abbr=on}}. The mature [[bark]] ranges widely in color, from pure white to red, yellowish, pinkish, or gray. Bark of twigs, seedlings, and saplings is dark, from reddish to almost black, and covered with resin glands. The [[leaf|leaves]] are triangular-ovate, {{convert|3|-|8|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|-|6|cm|abbr=on}} broad, with a truncate base and an acuminate apex, and a double-serrated margin. The [[fruit]]ing [[catkin]]s are {{convert|2|-|4|cm|abbr=on}} long and about  {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on}} broad. It is able to tolerate extreme cold, as low as {{convert|-55|F|C|order=flip}}.\n\nAlthough it is [[diploid]] like its close relatives, the [[Eurasia]]n [[Silver Birch]] and the eastern American [[Gray Birch]], it frequently [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridizes]] with the [[polyploid|hexaploid]] [[Paper Birch]]; the hybrid is known as ''Betula \u00d7 winteri''. Hybrids also occur with [[American Dwarf Birch]], named ''Betula \u00d7 uliginosa''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*[[Birch syrup]]\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233500257 Flora of North America: ''Betula neoalaskana'']\n*Packee, E.

''kenaica'') [[Alaska]] and in all [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] of [[Canada]], except [[Nunavut]], as well as the northern continental [[United States]], south to [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], with small isolated populations further south in [[mountain]]s to [[North Carolina]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Colorado]]. The most southerly stand in the Western United States is located in Long Canyon in the [[Boulder, Colorado|City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks]]. This is an isolated Pleistocene [[relict]] that most likely reflects the southern reach of boreal vegetation into the area during the last Ice Age.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/files/openspace/pdf_gis/IndependentResearchReports/249_Cooper_David_Ecological.pdf|title = Ecological Survey of the City of Boulder, Colorado Mountain Parks|last = Cooper|first = David J.|publisher = City of [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] Parks and Recreation Department|format = PDF|page = 16|date = Spring 1984|accessdate = 2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nIn Alaska, paper birch often naturally grows in pure stands with itself or with [[black spruce|black]] or [[white spruce]]. In the eastern and central regions of its range it is often associated with [[red spruce]] and [[balsam fir]].<ref name=\"fed\" /> It may also be associated with [[Big-Toothed Aspen|big-toothed aspen]], [[yellow birch]], ''[[Betula populifolia]]'', and [[Acer (plant)|maples]]\n\nShrubs often associated with paper birch in the eastern part of its range include: beaked hazel (''[[Corylus cornuta]]''), common bearberry (''[[Arctostaphylos uva-ursi]]''), dwarf bush-honeysuckle (''[[Diervilla lonicera]]''), wintergreen (''[[Gaultheria procumbens]]''), wild sarsaparilla (''[[Aralia nudicaulis]]''), blueberries (''[[Vaccinium]] spp.''), raspberries and blackberries (''[[Rubus]] spp.''), elderberry (''[[Sambucus]] spp.''), and hobblebush (''[[Viburnum alnifolium]]'').\n\n=== Successional relationships ===\n[[File:Boreal forestfire.jpg|thumb|left|A prescribed fire in a black spruce-paper birch-quaking aspen community in boreal Alaska.]]\n\n''Betula papyrifera'' is a [[pioneer species]] meaning it is often one of the first trees to grow in an area after other trees are removed by some sort of disturbance. Typical disturbances colonized by paper birch are [[wildfire]], [[avalanche]], or [[windthrow]] areas where the wind has blown down all trees. When it grows in these pioneer, or early [[secondary succession|successional]], woodlands it often forms stands of trees where it is the only species.<ref name=\"fs\">{{cite web|title=Betula papyrifera|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/betpap/all.html|website=www.fs.fed.us|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nPaper birch is considered well adapted to fires it recovers quickly by means of reseeding the area or regrowth from the burned tree. The lightweight seeds are easily carried by the wind to burned areas where they quickly germinate and grow into new trees. Paper birch is adapted to ecosystems where fires occur every 50\u2013150 years<ref name=\"fs\" /> For example, it is frequently an early invader after fire in [[black spruce]] [[boreal forest]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 |title=Black Spruce (Picea mariana) |first=C. Michael |last=Hogan |publisher=GlobalTwitcher |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005174426/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 |archivedate=2011-10-05 |df= }}</ref> As it is a pioneer species, finding paper birch within mature or climax forests is rare as it will be overcome by the more shade tolerant trees as secondary succession progresses.\n\nAs an example, in Alaskan boreal forests, a paper birch [[stand level modelling|stand]] 20 years after a fire may have {{convert|3000|-|6000|/acre||adj=pre|trees}}, but after 60\u201390 years the number of trees will decrease to {{convert|500|-|800|/acre||adj=pre|trees}} as spruce replaces the birch.<ref name=\"fs\" /> After approximately 75 years the birch will start dying and by 125 years most paper birch will have disappeared unless another fire burns the area.\n\nBlack birch trees themselves have varied reactions to A group, or stand, of paper birch is not particularly flammable, the canopy often has a high moisture content and the under story is often lush green.<ref name=\"fs\" /> As such, conifer crown fires often stop once they reach a stand of paper birch or become slower moving ground fires. Since these stands are fire resistant they may become seed trees to reseed the area around them which was burned. However, in dry periods paper birch is flammable and will burn rapidly.<ref name=\"fs\" /> As the bark is flammable it will often burn and may [[Girdling|girdle]] the tree.\n\n=== Wildlife ===\nBirch bark is a winter staple food for [[moose]]. The nutritional quality is poor due to the large quantities of [[lignin]], which make digestion difficult, but is important to wintering moose because of its sheer abundance.<ref name=\"fs\" /> Moose prefer paper birch over [[aspen]], [[alder]], and [[balsam poplar]] but they prefer willow (''[[salix|Salix spp.]]'') over birch and the other species listed. Although moose consume large amounts of paper birch in the winter, if they were to only eat paper birch they may die.<ref name=\"fs\" />\n\nAlthough [[white-tailed deer]] consider birch a \"secondary-choice food\", it is an important dietary component. In Minnesota, white-tailed deer eat considerable amounts of paper birch leaves in the fall. [[Snowshoe hare]]s browse paper birch seedlings.<ref name=\"fs\" /> [[North American porcupine|Porcupines]] feed on the inner bark of the tree and beavers will also feed on the tree. The seeds of paper birch are an important part of the diet of many birds and small mammals including [[chickadee]]s, [[redpoll]]s, [[vole]]s, and [[ruffed grouse]]. [[Yellow bellied sapsucker]]s drill holes in the bark of paper birch to get at the sap, this is one of their favorite trees for feeding on.<ref name=\"fs\" />\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:White birch at Acadia National Park, ME IMG 2177.JPG|200px|thumb|right|White birch at [[Acadia National Park]] in [[Maine]]]]\n\n''Betula papyrifera'' has a soft,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} yet moderately heavy, white wood. It makes excellent high-yielding firewood if seasoned properly. The dried wood has a density of {{convert|37.4|lb/ft3|abbr=on}} and an energy density 20,300,000 btu/cord.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wood \u2013 Combustion Heat Values|url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/wood-combustion-heat-d_372.html|website=www.engineeringtoolbox.com|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>  While paper birch does not have a very high overall economic value, it is used in furniture, flooring, popsicle sticks<ref>{{cite web|url = http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blpopsicle.htm|title = Popsicle \u2013 The History of the Popsicle|last = Bellis|first = Mary|publisher = [[About.com]]|accessdate = 2011-09-16}}</ref> [[pulpwood]] (for paper), [[plywood]], and [[oriented strand board]].<ref name=\"fs\" /> The wood can also be made into spears, bows, arrows, snowshoes, sleds and other items.<ref name=\"fs\" /> When used as pulp for paper, the stems and other non trunk wood are lower in quantity and quality of fibers and consequently the fibers have less mechanical strength, nonetheless, this wood is  still suitable for use in paper.\n\nThe sap is boiled down to produce [[birch syrup]]. The raw sap contains 0.9% carbohydrates ([[glucose]], [[fructose]], [[sucrose]])<ref name=\"fed\" /> as compared to 2-3% within [[sugar maple]] sap. The sap flows later in the season than maples.  Currently, only a few small scale operations in Alaska and [[Yukon]] currently produce birch syrup from this species.<ref name=\"fed\" />\n\n=== Bark ===\n[[File:Ecorce de bouleau.JPG|thumb|left|Peeling bark]]\nIts bark is an excellent fire starter; it ignites at high temperatures even when wet. The bark has an energy density of 5740 cal/g and 3209 cal/cm{{sup|3}}, the highest per unit weight of 24 species tested.<ref name=\"fed\" />\n\nPanels of bark can be fitted or sewn together to make cartons and boxes (a birchbark box is called a ''[[wiigwaasi-makak]]'' in the Anishinaabe language). The bark is also used to create a durable waterproof layer in the construction of sod-roofed houses.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\" /> Many indigenous groups (i.e. Wabanaki peoples) use birch-bark for making various items such as canoes, containers and wigwams.\n\n=== Plantings ===\nPaper birch is planted to reclaim old mines and other disturbed sites, often bare-root or small saplings are planted when this is the goal.<ref name=\"fs\" /> Since paper birch is an adaptable pioneer species it is a prime candidate for reforesting drastically disturbed areas.\n\nWhen used in landscape planting, it should not be planted near [[black walnut]] as the chemical [[juglone]], exuded from the roots of black walnut, is very toxic to paper birch.\n\nIt is frequently planted as an ornamental due to its graceful form and attractive bark. The bark changes to the white color at about 3 years of growth.<ref name=\"dirr\" /> Paper birch grows best in USDA zones 2-6;<ref name=\"dirr\" /> due to its intolerance of high temperatures, ''[[Betula nigra]]'', or river birch, is recommended for warm-climate areas warmer than zone 6 where paper birch is rarely successful.<ref name=\"ifas\">{{cite web|title=http://hort.ifas.ufl.edu/trees/BETPAPA.pdf|url=http://hort.ifas.ufl.edu/trees/BETPAPA.pdf|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> ''B. papyrifera'' is more resistant to the bronze birch borer than ''[[Betula pendula]]'' which is similarly planted as a landscape tree.\n\n== Pests ==\n[[Birch skeletonizer]] is a small larvea which feeds on the leaves and causes browning.<ref name=\"ifas\" />\n\n[[Birch leafminer]] is a common pest which feeds from inside of the leaf and causes the leaf to turn brown, the first generation appears in May but there will be several generations per year. Severe infestations may stress the tree and make it more vulnerable to the bronze birch borer.<ref name=\"ifas\" />\n\nWhen stressed, [[bronze birch borer]]s may kill a tree. The insect bores into the sapwood, beginning at the top of the tree and causing death of the tree crown.<ref name=\"ifas\" /> The insect has a D shaped emergance hole where it chews out of the tree.  Healthy trees are resistant to the borer but when grown in subideal conditions the defense mechanisms of the tree may not function properly. Chemical controls exist.\n\n== In culture ==\nIt is the provincial tree of [[Saskatchewan]] and the state tree of [[New Hampshire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ops.gov.sk.ca/Default.aspx?DN=392f9e7f-7d31-4a9f-81d1-2b95e7fdc8c6|title=Saskatchewan's Provincial Tree}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nh.gov/nhinfo/fastfact.html|title=Fast New Hampshire Facts|accessdate=August 28, 2012|publisher=NH.gov}}</ref>\n\nPeople sometimes vandalize the bark of this tree by carving into it with a knife or by peeling off layers of the bark.

This species goes by many common names including: '''Nootka cypress''', '''yellow cypress''', '''Alaska cypress''', '''Nootka cedar''', '''yellow cedar''', '''Alaska cedar''', and '''Alaska yellow cedar'''. The specific epithet \"nootkatensis\" is derived from its discovery on the lands of a [[First Nation]] of [[Canada]], those lands of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people]] of [[Vancouver Island]], [[British Columbia]], who were formerly referred to as the Nootka.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nFirst described in the genus ''[[Cupressus]]'' as ''Cupressus nootkatensis'' in 1824, it was transferred to ''[[Chamaecyparis]]'' in 1841 on the basis of its foliage being in flattened sprays, as in other ''Chamaecyparis'', but unlike most (though not all) other ''Cupressus'' species.\n\nHowever, this placement does not fit with the morphology and phenology of the cones, which are far more like ''Cupressus'', like them maturing in two years, not one.

Relationships within Cupressaceae sensu lato: a combined morphological and molecular approach. ''American Journal of Botany'' 87: 1044\u20131057. [http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/abstract/87/7/1044 Abstract]</ref> strongly supported its return to ''Cupressus'' and exclusion from ''Chamaecyparis''.\n\nMore recently, Farjon ''et al.'' (2002) transferred it to a new genus ''Xanthocyparis'', together with the newly discovered [[Xanthocyparis vietnamensis|Vietnamese golden cypress]] ''Xanthocyparis vietnamensis''; this species is remarkably similar to Nootka Cypress and the treatment has many arguments in its favour, as while they are not related to ''Chamaecyparis'', neither do they fit fully in ''Cupressus'' despite the many similarities.\n\nLittle et al.,<ref>Little, D.

The foliage is in flat sprays, with dark green, 3\u20135&nbsp;mm long scale-leaves. The [[conifer cone|cones]] have 4 (occasionally 6) scales, and resemble the cones of [[Cupressus lusitanica|Mexican Cypress]] (''Cupressus lusitanica'', another ''Cupressus'' species which can show foliage in flat sprays) fairly closely, except being somewhat smaller, typically 10\u201314&nbsp;mm diameter; each scale has a pointed triangular bract about 1.5\u20132&nbsp;mm long, again similar to other ''Cupressus'' and unlike the crescent-shaped, non-pointed bract on the scales of ''Chamaecyparis'' cones. The [[Caren Range]] on the west coast of British Columbia is home to the oldest Nootka Cypress specimens in the world, with one specimen found to be 1,834 years old (Gymnosperm Database).<ref name=\"Klinkenberg2014\">{{cite web | url= http://linnet.geog.ubc.ca/Atlas/Atlas.aspx?sciname=Xanthocyparis%20nootkatensis | last= Klinkenberg | first= Brian (Editor) | date= 2014 | title= ''Xanthocyparis nootkatensis'' | website= E-Flora BC: Electronic Atlas of the Plants of British Columbia [eflora.bc.ca]. | publisher= Lab for Advanced Spatial Analysis, Department of Geography, University of British Columbia, Vancouver | accessdate= 2015-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\"WTU Herbarium2015\">{{cite web | url= http://biology.burke.washington.edu/herbarium/imagecollection.php?Genus=Callitropsis&Species=nootkatensis | last= Giblin | first= David (Editor) | date= 2015 | title= ''Callitropsis nootkatensis'' | website= WTU Herbarium Image Collection | publisher= Burke Museum, University of Washington | accessdate= 2015-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\"Jepson\">{{cite web | url= http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_IJM.pl?tid=Callitropsis%20nootkatensis | date= 2015 | title= ''Callitropsis nootkatensis'' | website= Jepson eFlora: Taxon page | publisher= Jepson Herbarium; University of California, Berkeley | accessdate= 2015-03-31}}</ref>\n\n''Cupressus nootkatensis'' is one of the parents of the [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] [[Leyland Cypress]]; as the other parent, [[Cupressus macrocarpa|Monterey Cypress]], is also in genus ''Cupressus'', the ready formation of this hybrid is a further argument for the placement of the Nootka Cypress close to ''Cupressus''.\n\n===Climate-related Mortality===\nIn Alaska, where the tree is primarily referred to as \"yellow cedar,\" extensive research has been conducted into large-scale die-offs of yellow cedar stands. These studies have concluded that the tree has depended upon heavy coastal snowpacks to insulate its shallow roots from cold Arctic winters. The impacts of [[climate change]] have resulted in thinner, less-persistent snowpacks, in turn causing increased susceptibility to freeze damage.<ref name=PNWRS>[http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/news/2012/02/yellow-cedar.shtml Yellow-cedar are dying in Alaska; scientists now know why]</ref>  This mortality has been observed over 7% of the species range, covering approximately 10 degrees of latitude from northern southeast Alaska to southern British Columbia.

The wood has been used for flooring, interior finish and shipbuilding<ref>Peattie, Donald Culross.  Trees You Want to Know.  Whitman Publishing Company, Racine, Wisconsin, 1934 page 30</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe various physical properties of the [[wood]] make it an attractive material for both general construction and boat building. Due to its slow growth it is hard and, like other cypress woods it is durable; it therefore offers good dimensional stability, and is resistant to weather, insects, and contact with soil. It works easily with hand or machine tools; it turns and carves quite well. It can be fastened with glues, screws, and nails. Nootka Cypress's texture, uniform color, and straight grain will take a fine finish. It resists splintering and wears smoothly over time. When fresh cut it has a somewhat unpleasant bitter scent, but when seasoned it has barely any discernible scent, hence its traditional use in face masks.\n\nDue to its expense, it is used mainly for finished carpentry. Typical uses include exterior siding, shingles, decking, exposed beams, glue-laminated beams, paneling, cabinetry, and [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]]. In [[historic preservation]] it can be used as a substitute for ''[[Thuja plicata]]'' (Western Red Cedar) and ''[[Taxodium distichum]]'' (Baldcypress), due to current difficulties in obtaining quality timber of those species due to environmental concern and past over-exploitation, although this applies equally to Nootka Cypress.\n\nOther uses for Nootka Cypress include saunas, and battery containers due to its resistance to acids. Traditionally, paddles, masks, dishes, and bows were made from the wood.\n\n=== Landscaping ===\n[[Image:Chamaecyparis Nootkatensis.jpg|thumb|right|Cultivated Specimens at [[Morton Arboretum]]]]\n\nThe drooping branchlets give the tree a graceful weeping appearance. It makes an attractive specimen tree in [[park]]s and open spaces. It can also be used as a tall [[Hedge (gardening)|hedge]].\n\nIt will grow in [[USDA plant hardiness zone]]s 5-9, but can be difficult to grow. Best growth is in light or heavy soil, preferably well drained, and in climates with cool summers. It prefers semi-shade to full sun.\n\nNootka Cypress can also be used in [[bonsai]].\n\nThe [[cultivar]] ''C. nootkatensis'' 'Pendula' has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Cupressus nootkatensis'' 'Pendula'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=404|accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Firewood ===\nNootka Cypress has extreme heartwood qualities that make this one of the most desired sources of heat on the west coast. A dead tree can last up to 100 years for firewood. This wood burns very hot and lasts a long time as embers.\n\n== Indigenous societies ==\n\nSee main article for [[Indigenous Uses of Yellow Cedar]].\n\nThe Nootka Cypress is used extensively by the [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]], along with another cypress, ''[[Thuja plicata]]'' (Western Red Cedar).  While Western Red Cedar was preferred for larger projects (houses, canoes), Nootka Cypress was used for smaller carvings such as vessels and utensils.\n\nA legend amongst the Nootka peoples of the [[Hesquiaht First Nation]] tells of the origins of the Nootka Cypress.  In the legend, a [[raven]] encounters three young women drying salmon on the beach.  He asks the women if they are afraid of being alone, if they are afraid of bears, wolves, and other animals.  Each women responded \"no\".  But when asked about [[owl]]s, the women were indeed afraid of owls.  Hearing this, the trickster raven hid in the forests, and made the calls of an owl.  The terrified women ran up the mountains, but turned into Nootka Cypress trees when they were out of breath.  According to the Nootka, this is why Nootka Cypress grows on the sides of mountains, and also why the bark is silky like a woman's hair, the young trunk is smooth like a woman's body.<ref>Stewart, Hilary.

The lighter brown cones are from the current season; the darker brown cones are mature cones from previous seasons.]]\nTamaracks are very cold tolerant, able to survive temperatures down to at least {{convert|-65|C|F|0}}, and commonly occurs at the [[Arctic]] [[tree line]] at the edge of the [[tundra]]. Trees in these severe climatic conditions are smaller than farther south, often only {{convert|5|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall. They can tolerate a wide range of soil conditions but grow most commonly in [[swamp]]s, [[bog]]s, or [[muskeg]] in wet to moist organic soils such as [[sphagnum]] [[peat]] and woody peat. They are also found on mineral soils that range from heavy clay to coarse sand; thus texture does not seem to be limiting. Although tamarack can grow well on [[calcareous]] soils, it is not abundant on the [[limestone]] areas of eastern [[Ontario]].\n\n[[File:2015-08-20 17 12 36 Tamarack seedling in a sphagnum bog adjacent to Taborton Road (Rensselaer County Route 42) in Sand Lake, New York.jpg|thumb|upright|Tamarack sapling in a sphagnum bog]]\nTamarack is commonly an early invader.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 |title = Black Spruce |first = C. Michael |last = Hogan |work = GlobalTwitcher.com |date = November 24, 2008 |accessdate = 2011-05-28}}</ref> Tamarack is generally the first forest tree to invade filled-lake bogs. In the lake states, tamarack may appear first in the [[sedge mat]], sphagnum moss, or not until the bog shrub stage. Farther north, it is the pioneer tree in the bog shrub stage. Tamarack is fairly well adapted to reproduce successfully on burns, so it is one of the common [[pioneer species|pioneers]] on sites in the boreal forest immediately after a fire.\n\nThe central [[Alaska]]n population, separated from the eastern [[Yukon]] populations by a gap of about {{convert|700|km|mi}}, is treated as a distinct variety ''Larix laricina'' var. ''alaskensis'' by some botanists, though others argue that it is not sufficiently distinct to be distinguished.\n\n== Associated forest cover ==\n[[File:Tamarack.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Young tree with fall colors]]\nTamarack forms extensive pure stands in the [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] region of [[Canada]] and in northern [[Minnesota]]. In the rest of its [[United States]] range and in the [[Maritime Provinces]], tamarack is found locally in both pure and mixed stands. It is a major component in the [[Society of American Foresters]] (SAF) [[forest cover type]]s Tamarack and [[black spruce\u2013tamarack]].\n\n[[Black spruce]] (''Picea mariana'') is usually tamarack's main associate in mixed stands on all sites. The other most common associates include [[balsam fir]] (''Abies balsamea''), [[white spruce]] (''Picea glauca''), and [[quaking aspen]] (''Populus tremuloides'') in the boreal region. In the better organic soil sites in the northern forest region, the most common associates are the [[northern white-cedar]] (''Thuja occidentalis''), balsam fir, [[Fraxinus nigra|black ash]] (''Fraxinus nigra''), and [[red maple]] (''Acer rubrum''). In [[Alaska]], quaking aspen and tamarack are almost never found together. Additional common associates are [[American elm]] (''Ulmus americana''), [[balsam poplar]] (''Populus balsamifera''), [[jack pine]] (''Pinus banksiana''), [[paper birch]] (''Betula papyrifera''), [[Kenai birch]] (''B. papyrifera'' var. ''kenaica''), and [[yellow birch]] (''B. alleghaniensis'').\n\nTamarack stands cast light shade and so usually have a dense undergrowth of shrubs and herbs. Because the tree has an extensive range, a great variety of shrubs is associated with it. Dominant tall shrubs include [[American dwarf birch|dwarf]] and [[swamp birch]] (''Betula glandulosa'' and ''Betula pumila''), [[willow]]s (''Salix'' spp.), [[speckled alder]] (''Alnus rugosa''), and [[red-osier dogwood]] (''Cornus stolonifera''). Low shrubs include [[bog Labrador tea]] (''Ledum groenlandicum''), [[bog-rosemary]] (''Andromeda glaucophylla''), [[leather leaf]] (''Chamaedaphne calyculata''), and [[small cranberry]] (''Vaccinium oxycoccos''). Characteristically the herbaceous cover includes [[Carex|sedges]] ''(Carex'' spp.), [[cottongrass]] ''(Eriophorum'' spp.), [[three-leaved false Solomonseal]] (''Maianthemum trifolium''), [[marsh cinquefoil]] (''Potentilla palustris''), [[Caltha palustris|marsh-marigold]] (''Caltha palustris''), and [[bogbean]] (''Menyanthes trifoliata''). Ground cover is usually composed of [[sphagnum moss]] ''([[Sphagnum]]'' spp.) and other mosses.\n\n== Flowering and fruiting ==\nTamarack is [[monoecious]].  Male and female flowers are small, either solitary or in groups of 2 or 3, and appear with the needles. Male flowers are yellow and are borne mainly on 1- or 2-year-old branchlets. Female flowers resemble tiny roses.  They are reddish/maroon, have needles at their base which are shorter and bluer than the other needles on the tree.  They are borne most commonly on 2 to 4-year-old branchlets, but may also appear on branchlets 5 or more years old. Cones usually are produced on young growth of vigorous trees. On open-grown trees, cones are borne on all parts of the crown. Ripe cones are brown, oblong-ovoid, and 13 to 19&nbsp;mm (\u00bd to \u00be in) long.\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Larix laricina bonsai by Nick Lenz.jpg|thumb|upright|''Larix laricina'' bonsai]]\nThe [[wood]] is tough and durable, but also flexible in thin strips, and was used by the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] people for making [[snowshoe]]s and other products where toughness was required.

Tamarack trees were used before 1917 in [[Alberta]] to mark the northeast corner of sections surveyed within townships. They were used by the surveyors because at that time the very rot-resistant wood was readily available in the bush and was light to carry.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Their rot resistance was also why they were often used in early water distribution systems.\n\nThe aboriginal peoples of Canada's northwest regions used the inner bark as a poultice to treat cuts, infected wounds, [[frostbite]], boils and hemorrhoids.  The outer bark and roots are also said to have been used with another plant as a treatment for [[arthritis]], cold and general aches and pains.<ref>{{cite book |title=Aboriginal Plant Use in Canada's Northwest Boreal Forest |first=Robin James |last=Marles |publisher=Canadian Forest Service |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-660-19869-9 |page=<!--missing-->}}</ref>\n\nWildlife use the tree for food and nesting.

Although it can tolerate some shade during the first several years, it must become dominant to survive. When mixed with other species, it must be in the over story. The tree is a good self-pruner, and boles of 25- to 30-year-old trees may be clear for one-half or two-thirds their length.\n\nBecause tamarack is very shade-intolerant, it does not become established in its own shade. Consequently, the more tolerant black spruce eventually succeeds tamarack on poor bog sites, whereas northern white-cedar, balsam fir, and swamp hardwoods succeed tamarack on good swamp sites. Recurring [[sawfly]] outbreaks throughout the range of tamarack have probably speeded the usual succession to black spruce or other associates.\n\nVarious tests on planting and natural reproduction indicate that competing vegetation hinders tamarack establishment.\n\nThe shade-intolerance of tamarack dictates the use of even-aged management. Some adaptation of clear cutting or seed-tree cutting is generally considered the best [[silvicultural]] system because tamarack seeds apparently germinate better in the open, and the seedlings require practically full light to survive and grow well. Tamarack is also usually wind-firm enough for the seed-tree system to succeed. Satisfactory reestablishment of tamarack, however, often requires some kind of site preparation, such as slash disposal and [[herbicide]] spraying.\n\n== Damaging agents ==\nThe tamarack has thin bark and is therefore highly susceptible to fire damage, except perhaps in older, upland stands. However, the habitat of tamarack, especially south of the [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] forest, is normally wet enough to protect the tree from fire. The tamarack is also susceptible to high winds. Strong winds can uproot large tamarack trees growing in swamps or other wet-land sites where rooting is shallow. It has also been discovered that abnormally high water levels often kill tamarack stands. Those that survive under such conditions usually grow very slowly. Other effects of high water include dieback and the development of adventitious roots and shoots. Wetland road crossings and beaver damming are the primary causes of flooding.\n\nMany insect species are known to be destructive to tamaracks. The [[larch sawfly]] is the most destructive. Epidemics occur periodically across [[Canada]] and the northern [[United States]] and have caused tremendous losses of merchantable tamarack throughout most of the tree's range. Indications are that radial increment declines markedly after 4 to 6 years of outbreak. After 6 to 9 years of moderate to heavy defoliation, the trees die. In southeastern [[Manitoba]] and northern [[Minnesota]], however, imported parasites of the sawfly have become established and should reduce the frequency and duration of future outbreaks. Another serious defoliator is the [[larch casebearer]] ''[[Coleophora laricella]]''. The [[larch casebearer]] attacks tamarack of all ages, and several severe outbreaks have caused extensive mortality in some areas. Outbreak severity has lessened in recent years, however, probably due to imported parasites of the casebearer that have become widely established.\n\nOnly a few other insects and related organisms (such as [[mites]]) that feed on tamarack are known to sometimes cause serious injury. During an outbreak, the [[spruce budworm]] (''[[Choristoneura fumiferana]]'') can severely damage tamarack. The [[larch-bud moth]] (''[[Zeiraphera improbana]]'') has had occasional short epidemics, and the [[spruce spider mite]] (''[[Oligonychus ununguis]]'') is occasionally found in large numbers on tamarack. The [[Argyresthia laricella|larch-shoot moth]] ''([[Argyresthia laricella]])'' is widely distributed, but serious injury is unusual. One of the most common bark beetles attacking tamarack is the [[eastern larch beetle]] (''[[Dendroctonus simplex]]''), but it feeds mainly on weakened, dying, or dead trees.\n\nTamarack is a host to many pathogens, but only one cause diseases serious enough to have an economic impact on its culture, the ''[[Lachnellula willkommii]]'' fungus. It is a relatively new pathogen in Canada, first recorded in 1980 and originating in Europe. The fungus cause large [[canker]]s to form and a disease known as [[Larch#Diseases|Larch Canker]] which is particularly harmful to the tamarack larch, killing both young and mature trees.<ref>[http://www.exoticpests.gc.ca/es-details/disease/1000096 European larch canker] Natural Resources Canada</ref> Apart from this, the only common foliage diseases are rusts, such as the leaf rust in eastern and central North America. However, this rust, caused by the fungus ''[[Melampsora medusae]]'', and other rusts do little damage to tamarack. The [[needle-cast fungus]] ''[[Hypodermella laricis]]'' has attacked tamarack in [[Ontario]] and has the potential for local damage.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Larch ball]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n* ''This article incorporates text from the http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/silvics_manual/Volume_1/larix/laricina.htm, freely-licensed as a work of the US Fed.

Throughout the greater part of its range, white spruce routinely survives and is undamaged by winter temperatures of {{convert|\u221250|C|F}}, and even lower temperatures occur in parts of the range (Fowells 1965, Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990).<ref name=\"SilvicsNA\" /><ref name=\"fowells\"/> [[Taiga|Boreal]] ''Picea'' are among the few extremely hardy [[Pinophyta|conifers]] in which the bud primordia are able to survive temperatures down to {{convert|-70|C|F|disp=comma}} (Sakai and Larcher 1987).<ref name=\"sakai4\">Sakai, A.; Larcher, W. (Eds.) 1987. Frost Survival of Plants. Springer-Verlag, New York NY. 321 p.</ref>\n\nEspecially important in determining the response of white spruce to low temperatures is the physiological state of the various tissues, notably the degree of \"hardening\" or dormancy. A natural progression of hardening and dehardening occurs in concert with the seasons (Glerum 1985).<ref name=\"glerum1\">Glerum, C. 1985.

Newly flushed shoots of white spruce are very sensitive to spring frost (Smith 1949, Rowe 1955, McLeod 1964).<ref name=\"smith\">Smith, B.J. 1949. Silvicultural work at the Sault Ste.

Springer-Verlag, New York NY.</ref> First, classical definitions generally connote directional changes in species composition and community structure through time, yet the time frame needed for documentation of change far exceeds an average lifespan (Solomon et al. 1981).<ref name=\"solo\" /> The second feature that defies quantitative description is the end point or climax.\n\nFloodplain deposits in the Northwest Territory, Canada, are important in relation to the development of productive forest types with a component of [[white spruce]] (Jeffrey 1964).<ref name=\"jeff2\"/> The most recently exposed surfaces are occupied by sandbar vegetation or riparian shrub willows and alder (''Alnus incana''); with increasing elevation, the shrubs give way successively to [[Populus balsamifera|balsam poplar]] and white spruce forest. In contrast, older floodplains, with predominantly brown wooded soils, typically carry white spruce\u2013[[Populus tremuloides|trembling aspen]] mixedwood forest.\n\nInterrelationships among nutrient cycling, regeneration, and subsequent forest development on floodplains in interior Alaska were addressed by Van Cleve et al. (1980),<ref name=\"van1\">Van Cleve, K.; Dyrness, R.; Viereck, L. 1980. Nutrient cycling in interior Alaska flood plains. p. 11\u201318 ''in'' Murray, M.; Van Veldhuizen, R.M. (Eds.). Proc.

Rep., PNW-107. 52 p.</ref> who pointed out that the various stages in primary succession reflect physical, chemical, and biological controls of ecosystem structure and function. Thus, each successional stage has a species combination in harmony with site quality. Short-circuiting succession by planting a late successional species such as white spruce on an early successional surface may result in markedly reduced growth rates because of [[Nitrogen deficiency|nitrogen insufficiency]]. Without application of substantial amounts of fertilizer, use would have to be made of early successional alder and its site-ameliorating additions of nitrogen.\n\nNeiland and Viereck noted that \u201cthe slow establishment and growth of spruce under birch stands [in Alaska] may be partially due to effects of shading and general competition for water and nutrients, but may also be more directly related to the [[birch]] itself.

Alaska, Fairbanks AK, Sept. 1977.</ref>\n\nOn dry upland sites, especially south-facing slopes, the mature vegetation is white spruce, white birch, trembling aspen, or a combination of these species. Succession follows in one of two general patterns. In most cases, aspen and birch develop as a successional stage after [[Wildfire|fire]] before reaching the spruce stage. But, occasionally, with optimal site conditions and a source of seed, white spruce will invade with the [[hardwood]]s or within a few years thereafter, thereby producing even-aged white spruce stands without an intervening hardwood stage.\n\n== Associated forest cover ==\nThe White Spruce Cover Type may include other species in small numbers. In Alaska, associates include paper birch, trembling aspen, balsam poplar, and black spruce; in western Canada, additional associates are subalpine fir, balsam fir, Douglas-fir, jack pine, and lodgepole pine (Dyrness 1980).<ref name=\"vier1\">Dyrness, C.T. 1980.

On certain river bottom sites, however, black spruce may replace white spruce (Viereck 1970a).<ref name=\"vier1\"/> Earlier successional stages leading to the white spruce climax are the white spruce\u2013paper birch, white spruce\u2013aspen, balsam poplar, jack pine, and lodgepole pine types. The type shows little variation. The forest is generally closed and the trees well formed, other than those close to the timberline. Lesser vegetation in mature stands is dominated by [[moss]]es. [[Vascular plant]]s are typically few, but [[shrub]]s and [[herb]]s that occur \u201cwith a degree of regularity\u201d include: alder, willows, mountain cranberry, red-fruit bearberry, black crowberry, prickly rose, currant, buffaloberry, blueberry species, bunchberry, twinflower, tall lungwort, northern comandra, horsetail, bluejoint grass, sedge species, as well as ground-dwelling [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s. Several white spruce communities have been identified in interior Alaska: white spruce/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/sphagnum; white spruce/avens/moss; and white spruce/alder/bluejoint (Viereck 1975, Dyrness 1980).<ref>Viereck, L.A. 1975.

Through much of its range it averages {{convert|5|\u2013|15|m|round=5|abbr=on}} tall with a trunk {{convert|15|\u2013|50|cm|0|abbr=on}} diameter at maturity, though occasional specimens can reach {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}} diameter. The [[bark]] is thin, scaly, and grayish brown. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, {{convert|6|\u2013|15|mm|frac=16|abbr=on}} long, stiff, four-sided, dark bluish green on the upper sides, paler [[glaucous]] green below. The [[Conifer cone|cones]] are the smallest of all of the spruces, {{convert|1.5|\u2013|4|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad, spindle-shaped to nearly round, dark purple ripening red-brown, produced in dense clusters in the upper crown, opening at maturity but persisting for several years.<ref name=farjon /><ref name=rushforthc />\n\nNatural [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] occurs regularly with the closely related ''[[Picea rubens]]'' (red spruce), and very rarely with ''[[Picea glauca]]'' (white spruce).<ref name=farjon />\n\nIt differs from ''[[Picea glauca|P. glauca]]'' in having a dense cover of small hairs on the bark of young branch tips, an often darker reddish-brown bark, shorter needles, smaller and rounder cones, and a preference for wetter lowland areas. Numerous differences in details of its needle and [[pollen]] morphology also exist but require careful microscopic examination to detect. From true firs, such as ''[[Abies balsamea]]'' (balsam fir), it differs in having pendulous cones, persistent woody leaf-bases, and four-angled needles, arranged all round the shoots.\n\nDue to the large difference between [[heartwood]] and [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] moisture content, it is easy to distinguish these two wood characteristics in [[ultrasound]] images,<ref name=BlackSpruce>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wei | first1 = Q. | last2 = Chui | first2 = Y.

In swamp and [[muskeg]] it shows progressively slower growth rates from the edges toward the centre. The roots are shallow and wide spreading, resulting in susceptibility to [[windthrow]]. In the northern part of its range, [[ice pruning|ice pruned]] asymmetric black spruce are often seen with diminished foliage on the windward side.<ref>C.

In the [[Great Lakes States]] it is most abundant in peat [[bogs]] and swamps, also on transitional sites between peatlands and uplands. In these areas it is rare on uplands, except in isolated areas of northern [[Minnesota]] and the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]].\n\n[[File:Picea mariana taiga.jpg|thumb|left|Black spruce taiga, Copper River, Alaska.]]\nMost stands are even-aged due to frequent fire intervals in black spruce forests. It commonly grows in pure stands on organic soils and in mixed stands on mineral soils. It is tolerant of nutrient-poor soils, and is commonly found on poorly drained acidic [[peatlands]]. It is considered a [[climax species]] over most of its range; however, some ecologists question whether black spruce forests truly attain climax because fires usually occur at 50 to 150 year intervals, while \"stable\" conditions may not be attained for several hundred years.<ref name=farjon />\n\nThe frequent fire return interval, a natural [[fire ecology]], perpetuates numerous successional communities. Throughout [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] [[North America]], ''[[Betula papyrifera]]'' (paper birch) and ''[[Populus tremuloides]]'' (quaking aspen) are successional hardwoods that frequently invade burns in black spruce. Black spruce typically seeds in promptly after fire, and with the continued absence of fire, will eventually dominate the hardwoods.\n\nIt is a pioneer that invades the sedge mat in filled-lake bogs, though often preceded slightly by  ''[[Larix laricina]]'' (tamarack), with which it may in time form a stable forest cover in swamps. However, as the peat soil is gradually elevated by the accumulation of organic matter, and the fertility of the site improves, Balsam Fir and ''[[Thuja occidentalis]]'' (eastern arborvitae) will eventually replace black spruce and tamarack.\n\nThe larvae of the [[spruce budworm]] [[moth]] cause defoliation which will lead to death if it occurs several years in a row, though black spruce is less susceptible than white spruce or balsam fir. Trees most at risk are those growing with balsam fir and white spruce.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nNumerous [[cultivars]] have been selected for use in parks and gardens.  The cultivar ''P. mariana'' 'Nana' is a dwarf form which has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref name=RHS>{{cite web|title=Picea mariana 'Nana' AGM|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=3823|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society|accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Uses and symbolism ==\nBlack spruce is the [[Provincial tree emblems of Canada|provincial tree]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].\n\nThe timber is of low value due to the small size of the trees, but it is an important source of [[pulpwood]] and the primary source of it in [[Canada]].<ref name=Powers_Coniferous>{{cite book|last=Powers|first=R.F.|title=Coniferous Forests|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam [u.a].|isbn=978-0-444-81627-6|page=271|edition=1st|author2=Adams, M.B. |author3=Joslin, J.D. |author4= Fisk, J.N. |editor=Andersson, F.|chapter=Non-Boreal Coniferous Forests of North America}}</ref>  Fast-food chopsticks are often made from black spruce.<ref name=gd />\n\nHowever, it is increasingly being used for making [[cross laminated timber]] by companies such as Nordic Structures, which allows the high strength due to the tight growth rings to be assembled into larger timbers.<ref name=Chibougamou>{{cite web|title=BLACK SPRUCE'S UNIQUE FIBER|url=http://chibou.com/en/the-resource/black-spruce|website=Chantiers Chibougamou|accessdate=31 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{Commons+cat}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Least concern plants]]\n[[Category:Picea|mariana]]\n[[Category:Taiga and boreal forests]]\n[[Category:Trees of Subarctic America]]\n[[Category:Trees of Western Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1768]]\n[[Category:Provincial symbols of Newfoundland and Labrador]]\n[[Category:Trees of continental subarctic climate]]",

The crown is broad conic in young trees, becoming cylindric in older trees; old trees may not have branches lower than {{convert|30|\u2013|40|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The shoots are very pale buff-brown, almost white, and glabrous (hairless), but with prominent [[pulvini]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] are stiff, sharp, and needle-like, 15\u201325&nbsp;mm long, flattened in cross-section, dark glaucous blue-green above with two or three thin lines of [[stomata]], and blue-white below with two dense bands of stomata.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|cones]] are pendulous, slender cylindrical, {{convert|6|\u2013|10|cm|abbr=on}} long <ref>{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/dept/ldplants/pisi.htm|title=Picea sitchensis |publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=April 9, 2012}}</ref> and 2&nbsp;cm broad when closed, opening to 3&nbsp;cm broad. They have thin, flexible scales 15\u201320&nbsp;mm long; the bracts just above the scales are the longest of any spruce, occasionally just exserted and visible on the closed cones. They are green or reddish, maturing pale brown 5\u20137 months after pollination. The [[seed]]s are black, 3&nbsp;mm long, with a slender, 7\u20139&nbsp;mm long pale brown wing.\n\n===Size===\nMore than a century of logging has left only a remnant of the spruce forest. The largest trees were cut long before careful measurements could be made. Trees over {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall may still be seen in [[Pacific Rim National Park]] and [[Carmanah Walbran Provincial Park]] on [[Vancouver Island]], [[British Columbia]] (the Carmanah Giant, at {{convert|96|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, is the tallest tree in Canada), and in [[Olympic National Park]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Redwood National and State Parks|Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park]], [[California]] (United States); two at the last site are just over 96&nbsp;m tall. The Queets Spruce is the largest in the world with a trunk volume of {{convert|337|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}, a height of {{convert|75.6|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and a {{convert|4.55|m|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Diameter at breast height|dbh]].

The glossy green leaves, dull beneath, become golden to yellow, rarely red, in autumn. The species often propagates through its roots to form large clonal groves originating from a shared root system. These roots are not rhizomes, as new growth develops from advantitious buds on the parent root system (the ortet).\n\n''Populus tremuloides'' is the most widely distributed tree in North America, being found from Canada to central Mexico.<ref name=\"Silvics\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arborday.org/treeguide/treedetail.cfm?id=122 |publisher=[[Arbor Day Foundation]] |title=Aspen, Quaking (Populus tremuloides)}}</ref> It is the defining species of the [[aspen parkland]] [[biome]] in the [[Prairie Provinces]] of Canada and extreme northwest [[Minnesota]].\n\n== Name ==\nThe quaking or trembling of the leaves that is referred to in the common names is due to the flexible flattened [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]]. The specific epithet, ''tremuloides'', evokes this trembling behavior and can be literally translated as \"like [[Populus tremula|''(Populus) tremula'']]\", the European trembling aspen.\n\nSome species of ''Populus'' have petioles flattened partially along their length, while the aspens and some other poplars have them flattened from side to side along the entire length of the petiole.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:2015-03-16 12 22 15 Aspen catkins on Idaho Street (Interstate 80 Business) in Elko, Nevada.JPG|thumb|left|Aspen [[Catkin|catkins]] in spring]]\nQuaking aspen is a tall, fast growing tree, usually {{convert|20|-|25|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} at maturity, with a trunk {{convert|20|to|80|cm|ftin|0|abbr=in}} in diameter; records are {{convert|36.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in height and {{convert|1.37|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in diameter.\n\nThe bark is relatively smooth, colored greenish-white to gray, and is marked by thick black horizontal scars and prominent black knots.

In the [[United States]], it can be found as far north as the northern foothills of the [[Brooks Range]] in [[Alaska]], where road margins and gravel pads provide islands of well-drained habitat in a region where soils are often waterlogged due to underlying [[permafrost]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ackerman|first=Daniel|last2=Breen|first2=Amy|date=2016-06-06|title=Infrastructure Development Accelerates Range Expansion of Trembling Aspen ( Populus tremuloides , Salicaceae) into the Arctic|url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/4560|journal=ARCTIC|language=en|volume=69|issue=2|pages=130\u2013136|doi=10.14430/arctic4560|issn=1923-1245}}</ref> It occurs at low elevations as far south as northern [[Nebraska]] and central [[Indiana]]. In the western [[United States]], this tree rarely survives at elevations lower than {{convert|1500|ft|m}} due to hot summers experienced below that elevation, and is generally found at {{convert|5000|-|12000|ft|m}}. It grows at high altitudes as far south as [[Guanajuato]], Mexico.\n\nQuaking aspen grows in a wide variety of climatic conditions. January and July average temperatures range from {{convert|-30|C|F}} and {{convert|16|C|F}} in the [[Alaska Interior]] to {{convert|-3|C|F}} and {{convert|23|C|F}} in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]].

Each colony is its own clone, and all trees in the clone have identical characteristics and share a single root structure. A clone may turn color earlier or later in the fall than its neighbouring aspen clones. Fall colors are usually bright tones of yellow; in some areas, red blushes may be occasionally seen. As all trees in a given clonal colony are considered part of the same organism, one clonal colony, named [[Pando (tree)|Pando]], is considered the heaviest<ref name=\"multiple1\">Genetic Variation and the Natural History of Quaking Aspen, Jeffry B.

Aspens do produce seeds, but seldom grow from them. Pollination is inhibited by the fact that aspens are either male or female, and large stands are usually all clones of the same sex. Even if pollinated, the small seeds (three million per pound) are only viable a short time as they lack a stored food source or a protective coating.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\">Ewing, Susan.

Portland: Alaska Northwest Books, 1996.</ref>\n\n=== Dieback ===\nBeginning in 1996, individual North American scientists noticed an increase in dead or dying aspen trees. As this accelerated in 2004, word spread and a debate over causes began. No insect, disease, or environmental condition is yet specifically identified as a joint cause. Trees adjacent to one another are often stricken or not. In other instances, entire groves have died.\n\nMany areas of the Western US have experienced increased diebacks which are often attributed to ungulate grazing and [[wildfire suppression]]. At high altitudes where grasses can be rare, [[ungulate]]s can browse young aspen sprouts and prevent those young trees from reaching maturity. As a result, some aspen groves close to cattle or other grazing animals, such as deer or elk, have very few young trees and can be invaded by [[conifers]], which are not typically browsed. Another possible deterrent to aspen regeneration is widespread wildfire suppression.  Aspens are vigorous [[resprouter]]s and even though the above-ground portion of the organism may die in a wild-fire, the roots, which are often protected from lethal temperatures during a fire, will sprout new trees soon after a fire.  Disturbances such as fires seem to be a necessary ecological event in order for aspens to compete with conifers, which tend to replace aspen over long, disturbance-free intervals.  The current dieback in the American West may have roots in the strict fire suppression policy in the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} On the other hand, the widespread decimation of conifer forests by the [[mountain pine beetle]] may provide increased opportunities for aspen groves to proliferate under the right conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112713000352 | doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2013.01.008 | volume=299 | title=How will aspen respond to mountain pine beetle?

A conference was held in Utah in September 2006 to share notes and consider investigative methodology.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/26/science/earth/26aspen.html | work=The New York Times | first=Katie | last=Kelley | title=Emblem of the West Is Dying, and No One Can Figure Out Why | date=26 September 2006}}</ref>\n[[File:Populus tremuloides 8163.jpg|thumb|Typical yellow autumn foliage]]\n[[File:2014-10-05 14 33 30 Aspens showing autumn foliage coloration in Lamoille Canyon, Nevada.JPG|thumb|right|Atypical orange and red autumn foliage]]\n\n== Uses ==\nAspen bark contains a substance that was extracted by indigenous North Americans and European settlers of the western U.S. as a [[quinine]] substitute.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\" />\n\nLike other poplars, aspens make poor [[fuel wood]], as they dry slowly, rot quickly, and do not give off much heat. Yet they are still widely used in campgrounds because they are cheap and plentiful and not widely used in building lumber. Pioneers in the North American west used them to create [[log cabins]] and [[dugout (shelter)|dugouts]], though they were not the preferred species.\n\nThe leaves of the quaking aspen and other species in the genus ''Populus'' serve as food for [[caterpillar]]s of various moths and butterflies. See [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on poplars]].\n\nIn Canada, quaking aspen wood is used mainly for pulp products such as books, newsprint, and fine printing paper. It is especially good for panel products such as [[oriented strand board]] and [[waferboard]]. It is light in weight and is used for furniture, boxes and crates, core stock in plywood, and wall panels.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons and category-inline}}\n* {{Wikispecies-inline}}\n* [http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/poptre/all.html US Forest Service Fire Effects Information System: ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* [http://www.abtreegene.com/trees.html Alberta Forest Genetic Resources Council: ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/populus-tremuloides-quaking-aspen-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map for ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* {{ITIS |id=195773 |taxon=Populus tremuloides |accessdate=8 August 2006}}\n* Farrar, John Laird.

The bark can become hard enough to cause sparks when cut with a chainsaw.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\">Ewing, Susan. The Great Alaska Nature Factbook. Portland: Alaska Northwest Books, 1996.</ref> The stem is grey in the older parts and light brown in younger parts. The [[crown (botany)|crown]] is usually roughly conical and quite dense. In large trees the lower branches droop downwards. [[Spur shoot]]s are common. The [[wood]] has a light coloring and a straight grain.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are 7\u201320&nbsp;cm long with a glossy dark green upper side and glaucous light grey-green underside; larger leaves, up to 30&nbsp;cm long, may be produced on stump sprouts and very vigorous young trees. The leaves are alternate, elliptic with a crenate margin and an acute tip, and reticulate venation (see [[Leaf#Terminology|leaf terminology]]). The petiole is reddish. The [[bud]]s are conical, long, narrow and sticky, with a strong balsam scent in spring when they open.\n\n''Populus trichocarpa'' has an extensive and aggressive root system, which can invade and damage drainage systems. Sometimes the roots can even damage the foundations of buildings by drying out the soil.\n\n=== Reproduction ===\n'''Flowering and fruiting'''\n[[File:Black cottonwood male catkin and leaf buds.JPG|right|thumb|Male (pollen-producing) catkin and leaf buds (March 22)[[Sherwood, Oregon|Sherwood]], Oregon, USA ]]\n\n''Populus trichocarpa'' is normally [[dioecious]]; [[male]] and [[female]] [[catkin]]s are borne on separate trees. The species reaches [[flowering]] age at about 10 years. Flowers may appear in early March to late May in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]], and sometimes as late as mid-June in northern and interior [[British Columbia]], [[Idaho]], and [[Montana]]. [[Stamen|Staminate]] [[catkin]]s contain 30 to 60 [[stamen]]s, elongate to 2 to 3&nbsp;cm, and are [[deciduous]]. [[Pistillate]] [[catkin]]s at maturity are 8 to 20&nbsp;cm long with [[Ovule|rotund-ovate]], three [[carpel]]late [[subsessile fruit]]s 5 to 8&nbsp;mm long. Each capsule contains many minute [[seed]]s with long, white cottony hairs.\n\n'''Seed production and dissemination'''\n\nThe seed ripens and is disseminated by late May to late June in [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], but frequently not until mid-July in [[Idaho]] and [[Montana]]. Abundant seed crops are usually produced every year. Attached to its cotton, the seed is light and buoyant and can be transported long distances by wind and water. Although highly viable, longevity of ''P. trichocarpa'' seed under natural conditions may be as short as two weeks to a month. This can be increased with cold storage.\n\n[[File:Seeds and Fluff of Cottonwood.jpg|right|thumb|Seeds and Fluff of Cottonwood (July 1, 2012) [[Boise]], Idaho, USA]]\n\n'''Seedling development'''\n\nMoist seedbeds are essential for high germination, and seedling survival depends on continuously favorable conditions during the first month. Wet bottom lands of rivers and major streams frequently provide such conditions, particularly where bare soil has been exposed or new soil laid down. Germination is [[epigeal germination|epigeal]]. ''P. trichocarpa'' seedlings do not usually become established in abundance after [[logging]] unless special measures are taken to prepare the bare, moist seedbeds required for initial establishment. Where seedlings become established in great numbers, they thin out naturally by age five because the weaker seedlings of this shade-intolerant [[species]] are suppressed.\n\n'''[[Vegetative reproduction]]'''\n\nDue to its high levels of rooting hormones, ''P. trichocarpa'' sprouts readily. After [[logging]] operations, it sometimes regenerates naturally from rooting of partially buried fragments of branches or from stumps. Sprouting from roots also occurs. The species also has the ability to [[abscission|abscise]] shoots complete with green leaves. These shoots drop to the ground and may root where they fall or may be dispersed by water transport. In some situations, abscission may be one means of colonizing exposed [[sandbar]]s.\n\n== Distribution ==\n{{double image|right|Blackcottonwoodfull.jpg|150|blackcottonwoodtrunk.jpg|200|A large specimen in [[Diamond Ridge, Alaska]], and a close-up of the bark at the base of the trunk}}\nThe native range of ''P. trichocarpa'' covers large sections of western [[North America]]. It extends northeast from [[Kodiak Island]] along [[Cook Inlet]] to [[latitude]] 62\u00b0 30\u00b0 N., then southeast in southeast [[Alaska]] and [[British Columbia]] to the forested areas of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]], to the mountains in southern [[California]] and northern [[Baja California]] (lat. 31\u00b0 N.). It is also found inland, generally on the west side of the [[Rocky Mountains]], in [[British Columbia]], western [[Alberta]], western [[Montana]], and northern [[Idaho]]. Scattered small populations have been noted in southeastern [[Alberta]], eastern [[Montana]], western [[North Dakota]], western [[Wyoming]], [[Utah]], and [[Nevada]]. It grows up to elevations of 2100 m.\n\n''Populus trichocarpa'' has been one of the most successful introduction of trees to the otherwise almost treeless [[Faroe Islands]].\n\nThe species was imported from Alaska to [[Iceland]] in 1944 and has since become one of the most widespread trees in the country.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nIt is also grown as an [[ornamental tree]], valued for its fast growth and scented foliage in spring, detectable from over 100 m distance. The roots are however invasive, and it can damage the foundations of buildings on shrinkable clay soils if planted nearby (Mitchel 1996).\n\nBranches can be added to potted plants to stimulate rooting.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\"/>\n\n== Use as a model species ==\n''Populus trichocarpa'' has several qualities which makes it a good model species for trees:\n* Model genome size (although significantly larger than the other model plant, ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'')\n* Rapid growth (for a tree)\n* Reaches reproductive maturity 4\u20136 years\n* Economically important\n* It represents a [[phenotype|phenotypically]] diverse genus\n\nFor these reasons the species has been extensively studied. Its [[genome]] sequence was published in 2006 (see \"Genome\" below). More than 121 000 [[expressed sequence tag]]s (ESTs) have been [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] from it. The wide range of topics studied by using ''P. trichocarpa'' include the effects of [[ethylene]], [[lignin]] [[biosynthesis]], drought tolerance and [[wood]] formation.\n\n== Uses ==\n\n=== Lumber ===\n''Populus trichocarpa'' wood is light-weight and although not particularly strong, is strong for its weight. The wood material has short, fine [[cellulose]] fibres which are used in the production of high-quality book and magazine [[paper]]. The wood is also excellent for production of [[plywood]]. Living [[tree]]s are used as [[windbreak]]s.\n\n''Populus trichocarpa'' grows very quickly; trees in [[plantation]]s in Great Britain have reached {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall in 11 years, and {{convert|34|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall in 28 years (Mitchell 1996). It can reach suitable size for [[Wood pulp|pulp]] production in 10\u201315 years and about 25 years for [[timber]] production.\n\n=== Medicinal ===\nNative American tribes in the Pacific Northwest used ''P. trichocarpa'' for a variety of purposes. The inner bark was sometimes eaten but most of its uses were medicinal or practical. Because of its [[salicin]] content it was often used raw or in salves to treat a number of ailments including baldness, tuberculosis, rheumatism, and treating wounds. The wood, roots and bark were used for firewood, canoe making, rope, fish traps, baskets and structures. The gum-like sap was even used as a glue or as waterproofing.<ref name=\"Pojar\">Pojar, J. & MacKinnon, A. Plants of the Pacific Northwest Coast. Vancouver, British Columbia: Lone Pine Publishing, 2004.</ref>\n\nCommercial extracts are produced from the fragrant buds for use as a perfume in medicines and cosmetics.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\"/>\n\n'Populus trichocarpa'' contains [[salicin]], and has been used medicinally as an [[antipyretic]], [[analgesic]] and to control [[inflammation]].\n\n== Genome ==\n\n=== Characteristics ===\n* Size: 485 million [[base pair]]s. (Human genome: 3 billion base pairs)\n* Proportion of [[heterochromatin]] to [[euchromatin]]: 3:7\n* Number of [[chromosome]]s: 19\n* Number of putative genes: 45,555, the largest number of genes ever recorded (estimate in September 2008)\n* [[Mitochondrion|Mitochondrial genome]]: 803,000 [[base pair]]s, 52 [[gene]]s\n* [[Chloroplast|Chloroplast genome]]: 157,000 [[base pair]]s, 101 [[gene]]s\n\n=== General information ===\nThe sequence of ''P. trichocarpa'' is that of an individual [[female]] specimen '''\"Nisqually-1\"''', named after the [[Nisqually River]] in the [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state in the United States, where the specimen was collected. The [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] was performed at the [[Joint Genome Institute]] by using the [[shotgun sequencing|shotgun]] method. The depth of the sequencing was approximately 7.5 x (meaning that each [[base pair]] was [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] on average 7.5 times). [[Genome annotation]] was done primarily by the [[Joint Genome Institute]], the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], the [[Ume\u00e5 Plant Science Centre]] and [[Genome Canada]].\n\nPrior to the publication of ''P. trichocarpa'' [[genome]] the only available plant genomes were those of [[Arabidopsis thaliana|thale cress]] and [[rice]], both of which are [[herbaceous]]. ''P. trichocarpa'' is the first woody plant [[genome]] to be sequenced. Considering the economic importance of [[wood]] and wood products, the availability of a tree [[genome]] was necessary. The sequence also allows evolutionary comparisons and the elucidation of basic molecular differences between [[herbaceous]] and woody plants.\n\nDoty et al. (2016) found the first direct evidence of N2 fixation in the wild ''P. trichocarpa'' (a non-leguminous tree).<ref>Doty, S. L., Sher, A. W., Fleck, N. D., Khorasani, M., Bumgarner, R.

Brigham Young University Press, Provo.</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe Pacific yew is a small to medium-sized evergreen [[tree]], growing 10\u201315&nbsp;m tall and with a trunk up to 50&nbsp;cm diameter, rarely more. In some instances, trees with heights in excess of 20&nbsp;m occur in parks and other protected areas, quite often in gullies. The tree is extremely slow growing, and has a habit of rotting from the inside, creating hollow forms. This makes it difficult and sometimes impossible to make accurate rings counts to determine a specimen's true age. Often damaged by succession of the forest, it usually ends up in a squat, multiple leader form.\n\nIt has thin scaly brown [[bark]], covering a thin layer of off-white sap wood with a darker heartwood that varies in color from brown to a magenta/purplish hue. The [[leaf|leaves]] are lanceolate, flat, dark green, 1\u20133&nbsp;cm long and 2\u20133&nbsp;mm broad, arranged spirally on the stem, but with the leaf bases twisted to align the leaves in two flat rows either side of the stem except on erect leading shoots where the spiral arrangement is more obvious.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|seed cones]] are highly modified, each cone containing a single [[seed]] 4\u20137&nbsp;mm long partly surrounded by a modified scale which develops into a soft, bright red [[Berry (botany)|berry]]-like structure called an [[aril]], 8\u201315&nbsp;mm long and wide and open at the end. The arils are mature 6\u20139 months after pollination. The seeds contained in the arils are eaten by [[Thrush (bird)|thrushes]] and other [[bird]]s, which disperse the hard seeds undamaged in their droppings; maturation of the arils is spread over 2\u20133 months, increasing the chances of successful seed dispersal. The male cones are globose, 3\u20136&nbsp;mm diameter, and shed their [[pollen]] in early spring. It is mostly [[Plant sexuality|dioecious]], but occasional individuals can be variably [[Plant sexuality|monoecious]], or change sex with time.\n\n==Habitat==\nPacific yew grows in varying types of environments; however, in drier environments it is mostly limited to stream side habitats, whereas in moist environments it will grow up onto slopes and ridgetops.<ref name = Bolsinger1965/> Pacific yew is [[Shade tolerance|shade tolerant]]; however it can also grow in sun.<ref name = Mitchell>{{cite journal|last = Mitchell| first = A. |title = Acclimation of Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia) foliage to sun and shade | journal = Tree Physiology | volume = 18| url = http://treephys.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/11/749.full.pdf+html}}</ref> The tree's shade tolerance allows it to form an [[understory]], which means that it can grow along streams providing shade to maintain water temperature.<ref>{{cite web| title = Pacific Yew: a Faculative Riparian Conifer with an Uncertain Future | last = Scher | first = Stanley | last2 = Schwarzschild | first2 = Bert | year = 1989 | url = http://gis.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr110/psw_gtr110_d_scher.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Varieties of Pacific yew (''Taxus brevifolia'')==\n\n'''''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''reptaneta'''''. Although ''T. brevifolia'' is typically a tree as described above, ''T. brevifolia'' var. ''reptaneta'' is a shrub variety that generally occurs in the mid to upper elevation range of the typical variety, 3,500 to 4,000&nbsp;ft (1000\u20131219 m) at its southernmost occurrence in the [[Klamath Mountains]] region, and at lower elevations further north.<ref name=\"Spjut2007b\">Spjut, R. W. 2007. Taxonomy and nomenclature of ''Taxus''.  J. Bot. Res. Inst. Texas 1(1): 203\u2013289.</ref>  It is distinguished from young trees of the typical variety (var. ''brevifolia'') by its stems initially creeping along the ground for a short distance before ascending (curving) upwards and by the branches growing off to one side of the stem, usually the upper side.<ref>Web page, World Botanical Associates, ''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''reptaneta''; http://www.worldbotanical.com/taxus_brevifolia_var_reptaneta.htm. Retrieved 9 Dec 2014</ref> The epithet ''reptaneta'' is from the Latin reptans which means \u201ccreeping, prostrate, and rooting,\u201d<ref>Stearn, W. T.  1983.  Botanical Latin.  3rd ed.  David & Charles, London</ref> which is exactly what this variety does; in rooting it forms yew thickets; hence, the epithet ''reptaneta'' (etum means collective place of growth) and hence the common name, thicket yew. Unlike the typical variety, thicket yew grows in abundance on open sunny avalanche shoots or ravines as well as in the forest understory.  It also occurs along forest margins. In northwestern Montana, a variant of the thicket yew does not ascend upwards; rather, it remains along the ground.<ref name=\"Spjut2007b\" />  This is probably the ancestral form; the upright form with branches along the upper side would be the expected growth pattern that might evolve from one with stems that strictly creep along the ground since branches can only arise from the upper surface.\n\n''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''reptaneta'' has been arbitrarily indicated synonymous with typical yew, ''T. brevifolia'' (var. ''brevifolia''); there are no studies to support this view.  Even though the two varieties may be genetically distinct, some botanists recognize species or varieties only if they have different geographically ranges. For example, ''T. mairei'' var. ''speciosa'', which occurs with the typical variety in southern China in 10 of 13 provinces, was rejected because \u201cthere is no geographic reason\u201d for recognizing it<ref>M\u00f6ller M, Gao L-M, Mill RR, Liu J, Zhang D-Q, Poudel RC, Li D-Z, 2013. A multidisciplinary approach reveals hidden taxonomic diversity in the morphologically challenging ''Taxus wallichiana'' complex. Taxon 62: 1161\u20131177.</ref> even though it appears genetically distinct.<ref>Gao L-M, M\u00f6ller M, Zhang X-M, Hollingsworth ML, Liu J, Mill RR, Gibby M, Li D-Z, 2007. High variation and strong phylogeographic pattern among cpDNA haplotypes in ''Taxus wallichiana'' (Taxaceae) in China and North Vietnam. Molec. Ecol. 16: 4684\u20134698.</ref>\n\n''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''reptaneta'' has also been proposed to be elevated to subspecies status without justification or explanation. Such a change would likely cause considerable confusion in view of the subspecies rank having already been used in the genus ''Taxus'' for defining geographically separated subspecies of a single species (''T. baccata'').<ref>Pilger R, 1903. Taxaceae-Taxoideae\u2014Taxeae. ''Taxus''. In: Das Pflanzenreich IV (Engler A. ed.): 110\u2013116.</ref>  Further, it has been recommended that taxonomists be strongly discouraged from \u201celevating a \u2018variety\u2019 to a \u2018subspecies\u2019 unless there is sufficient scientific evidence to warrant such an elevation,\u201d and that \u201cit is crucial to provide continuity.\u201d<ref>Ellison AM, Davis CC, Calie PJ, Naczi RFC, 2014. Pitcher plants (''Sarracenia'') provide a 21st-century perspective on infraspecific ranks and interspecific hybrids: A modest proposal for appropriate recognition and usage. Syst. Bot. 39: 939\u2013949.</ref>\n\n'''''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''polychaeta'''''.  Typical ''Taxus brevifolia'', like most species in the genus, usually produces a single ovule on a complex scaly shoot, composed of a primary shoot and a secondary short shoot. To the casual observer they appear as one funnelform shoot with an ovule at the apex.<ref>Florin R, 1951. Evolution in cordaites and conifers. Acta Horti Berg. 16: 285\u2013388, plate</ref>  However, ''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''polychaeta'' differs from var. ''brevifolia'' in producing a relatively longer primary shoot<ref name=\"Spjut2007b\" /> with as many five secondary shoots.<ref>Web page, World Botanical Associates, Overview of the genus ''Taxus'', http://www.worldbotanical.com/TAXNA.HTM, retrieved 9 Dec 2014</ref> The epithet, ''polychaeta'', is in reference to the primary shoot resembling a [[polychaete]] worm; hence, its common name \u201cworm cone yew.\u201d Variety ''polychaeta'' appears to be relatively rare. It may have been [[extirpated]] from the type locality\u2014around Mud Bay near Olympia, Washington\u2014as a result of urban expansion. It is also known from northern Idaho and Sonoma County, California.<ref name=\"Spjut2007b\" /><ref>Web page, World Botanical Associates, ''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''polychaeta''; http://www.worldbotanical.com/taxus_brevifolia_var_polychaeta.htm; retrieved 9 Dec 2014</ref>\n\nAs in the case with thicket yew, worm yew has been indicated to be the same as the typical variety, but again there are no specific studies to support this conclusion.  The authority of thicket yew and worm cone yew has been involved in the study of the genus ''Taxus'' for 25 years at the time the varieties were described.<ref name=\"Spjut2007b\" /><ref>Spjut, R.

As it was already becoming scarce when its chemotherapeutic potential was realized, the Pacific yew was never commercially harvested from its habitat at a large scale; the widespread use of the paclitaxel (taxol) was enabled when a semi-synthetic pathway was developed from extracts of cultivated yews of other species. Unlicensed pharmaceutical production use of closely related wild yew species in India and China may be threatening some of those species.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = BGCI\n  | first = \n  | title = \u2018Miracle\u2019 Cures Face Extinction\n  | url=http://www.bgci.org/medicinal/2040\n  | accessdate = 2008-07-21 }}\n</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage: PacificYew_7684.jpg|Pacific Yew foliage underside\nImage: PacificYew_8544.jpg|Pacific Yew form\nImage: PacificYew_8538.jpg|Pacific Yew foliage\nImage:PacificYew_7790.jpg|Pacific Yew mat form\nImage: PacificYew_8566.jpg|Pacific Yew bark\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons-inline}}\n* {{IUCN2006|assessor=Conifer Specialist Group|year=1998|id=34041|title=Taxus brevifolia|downloaded=05 May 2006}}\n* Heiken, D.

Saplings that do not produce the chemical often rot at an early stage, causing some trees to grow with a somewhat hollow, rotten trunk.<ref name=\"stewart 22\"/>\n\nIt is also widely used throughout Europe and America for making [[beehive]] frames.\n\n== Role in indigenous societies ==\n[[File:Klallam people near canoe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Klallam]] people and canoe, ca. 1914]]\n\nWestern redcedar has an extensive history of use by [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Native Americans]] of coastal Oregon to southeast Alaska. Some northwest coast tribes refer to themselves as \"people of the redcedar\" because of their extensive dependence on the tree for basic materials. The wood has been used for constructing housing and [[totem pole]]s, and crafted into many objects, including masks, utensils, boxes, boards, instruments, canoes, vessels, houses, and ceremonial objects. Roots and bark were used for baskets, bowls, ropes, clothing, blankets, and rings.<ref name=\"stewart 17 19\">Stewart, pp. 17\u201319</ref><ref>Van Pelt, p. 30</ref>\n\n===History===\nA huge number of archeological finds point to the continuous use of redcedar wood in native societies. Woodworking tools dating between 8000 and 5000 years ago, such as carved antlers, were discovered in [[shell midden]]s at the Glenrose site, near [[Vancouver]], British Columbia.<ref name=\"stewart 27\">Stewart, p. 27</ref> In [[Yuquot, British Columbia|Yuquot]], on the west coast of Vancouver Island, tools dating 4000 to 3000 years old have been found.<ref name=\"stewart 27\"/> The Musqueam site, also near Vancouver, yielded bark baskets woven in five different styles, along with ropes and ships dated to 3000 years ago. At [[Pitt River]], [[adze]]s and baskets were dated around 2900 years aol. Wooden artifacts 1000 years old were unearthed on the east coast of [[Vancouver Island]].<ref name=\"stewart 26\">Stewart, p. 26</ref>\n\nRed cedar was used extensively wherever it was found along the northwest coast ([[British Columbia]], [[Washington state]], Parts of [[Alaska]]). Evidence of this use is found in CMTs ([[Culturally Modified Trees]]) that are found throughout the coast. When First Nations people removed the bark from cedars, it left a scar - which is considered a CMT. Other types of harvest (for planks, tinder, and other uses) leave different types of evidence of cultural modification.\n\nA legend amongst the [[Coast Salish peoples]] describes the origins of the western redcedar. In this legend, there was a generous man who gave the people whatever they needed. When the [[Great Spirit]] saw this, he declared that when the generous man died, a great redcedar tree will grow where he is buried, and that the cedar will be useful to all the people, providing its roots for baskets, bark for clothing, and wood for shelter.<ref name=\"stewart 27\"/>\n\n=== Tools ===\nThe wood was worked primarily with the [[adze]], which was preferred over all other tools, even ones introduced by European settlers. Alexander Walker, an ensign on the fur trade ship ''Captain Cook'', reported that the indigenous peoples used an elbow adze, which they valued over new tools brought by the Europeans, such as the [[saw]] or the [[axe]], going so far as to modify traded tools back into an adze. Tools were generally made from stone, bone, [[obsidian]], or a harder wood such as [[Tsuga|hemlock]]. A variety of hand [[Post maul|maul]]s, wedges, chisels, and knives were used. Excavations done at [[Ozette, Washington]] turned up iron tools nearly 800 years old, far before European contact. When [[James Cook]] passed the area, he observed that almost all tools were made of iron.<ref name=\"stewart 36\">Stewart, p. 36</ref> There has been speculation on the origin of these iron tools. Some theories include shipwrecks from [[East Asia]] or possible contact with iron-using cultures from [[Siberia]], as hinted in the more advanced woodworking found in northern tribes such as the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]].<ref name=\"stewart 36\"/><ref>Pritzker, p. 292</ref><ref>Miller, p. 67</ref><ref>DeCapua, pp. 16\u201320</ref>\n\n=== Wood ===\n[[File:Moa-4.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A pole outside a six-post house at the [[University of British Columbia]]]]\nHarvesting redcedars required some ceremony and included propitiation of the tree's spirits as well as those of the surrounding trees. In particular, many people specifically requested the tree and its brethren not to fall or drop heavy branches on the harvester,<ref name=\"stewart 39\">Stewart, p. 39</ref> a situation which is mentioned in a number of different stories of people who were not sufficiently careful. Some professional loggers of Native American descent have mentioned that they offer quiet or silent propitiations to trees which they fell, following in this tradition.\n\nFelling of large trees such as redcedar before the introduction of steel tools was a complex and time-consuming art. Typically the bark was removed around the base of the tree above the buttresses. Then some amount of cutting and splitting with stone adzes and mauls would be done, creating a wide triangular cut. The area above and below the cut would be covered with a mixture of wet moss and clay as a firebreak. Then the cut would be packed with tinder and small kindling and slowly burned. The process of cutting and burning would alternate until the tree was mostly penetrated through, and then careful tending of the fire would fell the tree in the best direction for handling. This process could take many days. Constant rotation of workers was involved to keep the fires burning through night and day, often in a remote and forbidding location.<ref name=\"stewart 37 38\">Stewart, pp. 37\u201338</ref>\n\nOnce the tree was felled, the work had only just begun, as it then had to be stripped and dragged down to shore. If the tree was to become canoes, then it would often be divided into sections and worked into rough canoe shapes before transport. If it were to be used for a totem pole or building materials, it would be towed in the round to the village.<ref name=\"stewart 40\">Stewart, p. 40</ref> Many trees are still felled in this traditional manner for use as totem poles and canoes, particularly by artists who feel that using modern tools is detrimental to the traditional spirit of the art. Non-traditionalists simply buy redcedar logs or lumber at mills or lumber yards, a practice that is commonly followed by most working in smaller sizes such as for masks and staves.\n\nBecause felling required such an extraordinary amount of work, if only planks for housing were needed, these would be split from the living tree. The bark was stripped and saved, and two cuts were made at the ends of the planking. Then wedges would be pounded in along the sides and the planks slowly split off the side of the tree.<ref name=\"stewart 42\">Stewart, p. 42</ref> Trees which have been so harvested are still visible in some places in the rainforest, with obvious chunks taken off of their sides. Such trees usually continue to grow perfectly well, since redcedar wood is resistant to decay. Planks are straightened by a variety of methods, including weighing them down with stones, lashing them together with rope, or forcing them between a line of stakes.<ref name=\"stewart 43\">Stewart, p. 43</ref>\n\n[[File:Thuja plicata bark.png|thumb|upright|Illustration of women pulling bark from a tree, from ''Indian Legends of Vancouver Island'' by Alfred Carmichael]]\nRedcedar wood is used to make huge [[monoxyla]] [[canoe]]s in which the men went out to high sea to harpoon [[whale]]s and conduct trade.<ref>McNeese, p. 43</ref> One of those canoes, a {{convert|38|ft|m|adj=on}} craft dug out about a century ago, was bought in 1901 by Captain [[John Voss (sailor)|John Voss]], an adventurer. He gave her the name of [[Tilikum (boat)|Tilikum]] (\"Friend\" in Chinook jargon), rigged her, and led her in a hectic three-year voyage from British Columbia to [[London]].<ref>Dill, pp. 127\u2013128</ref>\n\nRedcedar branches are very flexible and have good tensile strength. They were stripped and used as strong cords for [[fishing]] line, rope cores, twine, and other purposes where bark cord was not strong enough or might fray. Both the branches and bark rope have been replaced by modern fiber and nylon cordage among the aboriginal northwest coast peoples, though the bark is still in use for the other purposes mentioned above.\n\n=== Bark ===\nAt the right time of year, the [[bark]] is easily removed from live trees in long strips. It is harvested for use in making mats, [[rope]] and cordage, [[basket]]ry, rain hats, [[clothing]], and other soft goods. The harvesting of bark must be done with care because, if the tree is completely stripped, it will die. To prevent this, the harvester usually only harvests from trees which have not been stripped before.<ref name=\"stewart 116\">Stewart, p. 116</ref> After harvesting the tree is not used for bark again, although it may later be felled for wood. Stripping bark is usually started with a series of cuts at the base of the tree above any buttresses, after which the bark is peeled upwards. To remove bark high up, a pair of platforms strung on rope around the tree are used and the harvester climbs by alternating between them for support. Since redcedars lose their lower branches as all tall trees do in the rainforest, the harvester may climb {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} or more into the tree by this method. The harvested bark is folded and carried in backpacks.<ref name=\"stewart 115\">Stewart, p. 115</ref> It can be stored for quite some time as mold does not grow on it, and is moistened before unfolding and working. It is then split lengthwise into the required width and woven or twisted into shape. Bark harvesting was mostly done by women, despite the danger of climbing 10 meters in the air, because they were the primary makers of bark goods.<ref name=\"stewart 113\">Stewart, p. 113</ref>\n\nToday bark rope making is a lost art in many communities, although it is still practiced for decoration or art in a few places. Other uses of bark are still common for artistic or practical purposes. In recent years there has been a revival of cedar weaving in some communities, and along with it, new forms of cedar bark products. For example, in some recent weddings cedar roses are used to decorate the tables.\n\n==Legal status==\nWestern red cedar is export-restricted in the United States under the [[Export Administration Regulations]].\n\n== Health and safety ==\nWestern red cedar is highly allergenic and woodworkers or [[loggers]] who work with it may have adverse reactions, including the development of [[occupational asthma]], exacerbation of existing [[asthma]], reduction of [[lung function]], and eye irritation. Approximately 5% of workers are allergic to western red cedar. The US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has set a [[permissible exposure limit]] for red cedar dust of 2.5&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> as a time-weighted average over 8 hours.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pel88/WOODDUST.html|title = Wood Dust|date = 28 September 2011|accessdate = |website = |publisher = OSHA/NIOSH}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n* [[Cedar wood]]\n* [[List of superlative trees]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|24em}}\n\n==Works cited==\n{{refbegin|32em}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bitner|first=Richard L.|title=Conifers for Gardens: an Illustrated Encyclopedia|year=2007|publisher=Timber Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=0-88192-830-5}}\n*{{cite journal |author=Chedgy, Russell J. |author2=Young Woon Lim |author3=Colette Breuil |last-author-amp=yes |year=2009 |title=Effects of leaching on fungal growth and decay of western redcedar (''Thuja plicata'') |journal=[[Canadian Journal of Microbiology]] |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=578\u2013586 |pmid=19483786 |doi=10.1139/W08-161}}\n*{{cite book|last=DeCapua|first=Sarah|title=The Tlingit|series=First Americans|location=Tarrytown, New York|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Benchmark|year=2010|isbn=0-7614-4135-2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Dill|first=J.

They have 15\u201325 thin, flexible scales {{convert|7|\u2013|13|mm|frac=32|abbr=on}} long. The immature cones are green, maturing gray-brown 5\u20137 months after pollination. The [[seed]]s are brown, {{convert|2|\u2013|3|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long, with a slender, {{convert|7|\u2013|9|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long pale brown wing.<ref name=farjon /><ref name=gd />\n\n== Ecology ==\nWestern hemlock is closely associated with [[temperate rain forests]], and most of its range is less than {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. There is however an inland population in the [[Columbia Mountains]] in southeast [[British Columbia]], northern [[Idaho]] and western [[Montana]]. It mostly grows at low altitudes, from sea level to {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but up to {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the interior part of its range in Idaho.<ref name=farjon /><ref name=gd />\n\nIt is a very shade-tolerant tree; among associated species in the Pacific Northwest, it is matched or exceeded in shade tolerance only by [[Taxus brevifolia|Pacific yew]] and [[Abies amabilis|Pacific silver fir]].<ref name=packee />   Young plants typically grow up under the canopy of other conifers such as [[Sitka spruce]] or [[Douglas-fir]], where they can persist for decades waiting to exploit a gap in the canopy.  They eventually replace these conifers, which are relatively shade-intolerant, in climax forest. However, [[storm]]s and [[wildfire]]s will create larger openings in the forest where these other species can then regenerate.\n\nInitial growth is slow; one-year-old seedlings are commonly only {{convert|3|\u2013|5|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} tall, and two-year-old seedlings {{convert|10|\u2013|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} tall. Once established, saplings in full light may have an average growth rate of {{convert|50|\u2013|120|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} (rarely {{convert|140|cm|in|0|disp=comma|abbr=on}}) annually until they are {{convert|20|\u2013|30|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall, and in good conditions still {{convert|30|\u2013|40|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} annually when {{convert|40|\u2013|50|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall.  The tallest specimen, {{convert|82.83|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, is in [[Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park]], [[California]] (United States). It is long-lived, with trees over 1200 years old known.<ref name=gd />\n\nWestern hemlock forms [[ectomycorrhiza]]l associations with some well-known [[edible mushroom|edible fungi]] such as chanterelles (''[[Cantharellus formosus]]'', ''[[Cantharellus subalbidus|C. subalbidus]]'', and ''[[Craterellus tubaeformis]]'').<ref name=dun06 /><ref name=trappe04 />\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Tsuga heterophylla1.jpg|left|thumb|Young western hemlock]]\nWestern hemlock is the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].<ref>{{cite web |website=Washington State Government |url=http://www.leg.wa.gov/Legislature/StateSymbols/ |title=State Symbols}}</ref>\n\n=== Cultivation ===\nWestern hemlock is cultivated as an [[ornamental tree]] in gardens in its native habitats and along the U.S. Pacific Coast, where its best reliability is seen in wetter regions. In relatively dry areas, as at [[Victoria, British Columbia]], it is exacting about soil conditions. It needs a high level of organic matter (well-rotted wood from an old log or stump is best; animal manures may have too much [[nitrogen]] and [[salt]]), in a moist, acidic soil. It is also cultivated in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions worldwide.  It has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector \u2013 ''Tsuga heterophylla''|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1957|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Forestry ===\nWhen planted well upon the banks along a river, western hemlock can help to reduce erosion.\n\nOutside of its native range, western hemlock is of importance in [[forestry]] for timber and [[paper]] production, and as an [[ornamental tree]] in large [[garden]]s, in northwest Europe and southern New Zealand.\n\nIt has [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] in some parts of Great Britain and New Zealand, not so extensively as to be considered an [[invasive species]], but an [[introduced species]] tree.\n[[File:Tsuga heterophylla forest.jpg|thumb|right|''T. heterophylla'' often grows on [[coarse woody debris]] such as [[nurse log]]s and cut stumps]]\n\n=== Food ===\nThe edible [[Cork cambium|cambium]] can be collected by scraping slabs of removed bark. The resulting shavings can be eaten immediately, or can be dried and pressed into cakes for preservation. The bark also serves as a source of [[tannin]] for [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]].\n\nTender new growth needles (leaves) can be chewed directly or made into a bitter tea, rich in [[vitamin C]] (similar to some other hemlock and pine species).\n\nWestern hemlock boughs are used to collect [[herring]] eggs during the spring spawn in [[southeast Alaska]]. The boughs provide an easily collectible surface for the eggs to attach to as well as providing a distinctive taste. This practice originates from traditional gathering methods used by [[Alaska Natives|Native Alaskans]] from southeast Alaska, specifically the [[Tlingit people]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n\n* [[Tsuga canadensis]] the Eastern Hemlock\n\n== References ==\n{{commons+cat}}\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=trappe04>{{cite journal| journal=Mycologia|date=May\u2013Jun 2004| volume=96| issue=3| pages=498\u2013509| title=Habitat and host associations of ''Craterellus tubaeformis'' in northwestern Oregon| last=Trappe| first=MJ| pmid=21148873| url=http://www.mycologia.org/content/96/3/498.full| doi=10.2307/3762170}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=dun06>{{cite journal| title=Forest stand age and the occurrence of chanterelle (''Cantharellus'') species in Oregon\u2019s central Cascade Mountains| first=Susie M.| last=Dunham| first2=Thomas E.| last2=O'Dell| first3=Randy| last3=Molina| journal=Mycological Research| volume=110| year=2006| pages=1433\u201340| url=http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/bitstream/10113/13297/1/IND44024112.pdf| format=PDF| doi=10.1016/j.mycres.2006.09.007| pmid=17123812}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n[[Category:Pacific temperate rainforests ecoregion]]\n[[Category:Tsuga|heterophylla]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the West Coast of the United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Cascade Range]]\n[[Category:Trees of Alaska]]\n[[Category:Trees of British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of mild maritime climate]]\n[[Category:Least concern plants]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]\n[[Category:Trees of Subarctic America]]\n[[Category:Trees of Western Canada]]",

They have a trunk diameter of up to {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}}. The [[bark]] is thin and square-cracked or furrowed, and gray in color. The crown is a neat, slender, conic shape in young trees with a tilted or drooping lead shoot, becoming cylindric in older trees. At all ages, it is distinguished by the slightly pendulous branchlet tips. The shoots are orange\u2013brown, with dense pubescence about {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on|in|frac=16}} long. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, {{convert|7|to|25|mm|abbr=on|in|frac=16}} long and {{convert|1|to|1.5|mm|abbr=on|in|frac=32}} broad, soft, blunt-tipped, only slightly flattened in cross-section, pale glaucous blue-green above, and with two broad bands of bluish-white [[stoma]]ta below with only a narrow green midrib between the bands; they differ from those of any other species of hemlock in also having stomata on the upper surface, and are arranged spirally all around the shoot.\n\n[[File:MountainHemlock 6739.jpg|left|thumb|Foliage and cones of subsp. ''mertensiana'']]\n\nThe [[conifer cone|cones]] are small (but much longer than those of any other species of hemlock), pendulous, cylindrical, {{convert|30|to|80|mm|abbr=on|frac=2}} long and {{convert|8|to|10|mm|abbr=on|in|frac=16}} broad when closed, opening to {{convert|12|to|35|mm|abbr=on|frac=16}} broad, superficially somewhat like a small [[spruce]] cone. They have thin, flexible scales {{convert|8|to|18|mm|abbr=on|in|frac=16}} long. The immature cones are dark purple (rarely green), maturing red\u2013brown 5 to 7 months after pollination. The [[seed]]s are red\u2013brown, {{convert|2|to|3|mm|abbr=on|in|frac=16}} long, with a slender, {{convert|7|to|12|mm|in|abbr=on|frac=16}}-long pale pink\u2013brown wing.<ref name=farjon/><ref name=fna/><ref name=gd/>\n\n==Distribution==\nThe geographic range of ''Tsuga mertensiana'' fairly closely matches that of ''[[Tsuga heterophylla]]'' (western hemlock), likewise mostly less than {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[Pacific Ocean]] apart from a similar inland population in the [[Rocky Mountains]] in southeast [[British Columbia]], northern [[Idaho]] and western [[Montana]]. Their ranges, however, differ in California, where western hemlock is restricted to the [[Coast Ranges]] and mountain hemlock is found in the [[Klamath Mountains]] and [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. Unlike western hemlock, mountain hemlock mostly grows at high altitudes except in the far north, from sea level to {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} in Alaska, {{convert|1600|to|2300|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] in [[Oregon]], and {{convert|2500|to|3050|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the Sierra Nevada.<ref name=farjon/><ref name=fna/><ref name=gd/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[Image:Tsuga mertensiana2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Foliage of subsp.

[[Arborescent]] individuals that have narrowly conical crowns until old age (300 to 400 years) and shrubby [[krummholz]] on cold, windy sites near timberline add beauty to mountain landscapes. Areas occupied by mountain hemlock generally have a cool to cold [[maritime climate]] that includes mild to cold winters, a short, warm-to-cool growing season and moderate to high precipitation.<ref name=silvics>{{Silvics |volume=1 |genus=Tsuga |species=mertensiana |first=Joseph E. |last=Means}}</ref>\n\nBest development of mountain hemlock is on loose, coarse-textured, well-drained soils with adequate moisture, and in [[British Columbia]], on thick and very acidic organic matter and decayed wood.<ref name=zone>{{cite book|last1=Brooke|first1=Robert C.|first2=E.

''grandicona'' in the [[Carson Range]] of Nevada]]\nMountain hemlock will grow on most [[landform]]s, but individuals typically develop best in mixed stands of forest on sheltered slopes or in draws. From southern British Columbia south, the tree grows better on northerly exposures. The preference for relatively moist, cool sites evidently becomes a necessity as the climate becomes more [[continental climate|continental]] in western Montana and more [[mediterranean climate|mediterranean]] in the central [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] at these extremes of its range.<ref name=Montana>{{cite journal|last=Habeck|first=James R.|year=1967|title=Mountain hemlock communities in western Montana|journal=Northwest Science|volume=41|issue=4|pages=169\u2013177}}</ref> In these locations, mountain hemlock typically grows in isolated populations in north-facing glens and [[cirque]] basins where snow collects and may remain well into summer.<ref name=silvics/>\n\nMountain hemlock is adapted to sites with long-lasting [[snowpack]]s. In the spring, mountain hemlocks emerging through {{convert|2|to|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} of snow were [[evapotranspiration|transpiring]], whereas nearby [[whitebark pine]]s did not transpire until the soil beneath them was free of snow.<ref name=silvics/> Mountain hemlock is well adapted to cope with heavy snow and ice loads, with tough branches and the drooping branchlets shedding snow readily.<ref name=gd/>\n\nMountain hemlock is tolerant of shade and other forms of competition. It is more tolerant than all its associates except [[Pacific silver fir]], [[Tsuga heterophylla|western hemlock]], and [[Alaska cedar]].<ref name=BC>{{cite book|last=Krajina|first=V.

J.|editor-last=Krajina|publisher=University of British Columbia, Department of Biology|location=Vancouver, BC}}</ref> Mountain hemlock is considered a minor climax species on most of its habitats; however, it pioneers on glacial moraines in British Columbia and Alaska. Pacific silver fir is a major climax species in many communities of the mountain hemlock forest in British Columbia and Washington and northern Oregon.<ref name=zone/><ref name=BC/> Alaska cedar, [[western redcedar]], and western hemlock are climax associates on some sites. Mountain hemlock is more commonly the major climax species in the mountain hemlock zone south of central Oregon where Pacific silver fir does not occur.<ref name=silvics/>\n\nMountain hemlock often succeeds [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]] or [[subalpine fir]] when these species pioneer on drier sites. It also tends to replace [[Picea engelmannii|Engelmann spruce]] when the two species occur together, possibly because hemlock is better able to withstand the [[Allelopathy|allelopathic]] effects of spruce than are other associated species.<ref name=silvics/>\n\n==Cultivation==\nOutside of its native range, mountain hemlock is grown as an [[ornamental tree]]. It is planted as a specimen tree in [[native plant]] [[landscape]]s in [[California]], and particularly in [[garden]]s in northern [[Great Britain]] and [[Scandinavia]], where it is appreciated for its blue\u2013green color and tolerance of severe weather. Cultivation is limited by the very slow growth of young plants and its susceptibility to urban [[air pollution]].\n\nSeveral [[cultivar]]s have been selected, mainly for intensely [[glaucous]] foliage color including: \n* 'Blue Star' \n* 'Glauca'<ref name=rushforthc>Rushforth, K.
