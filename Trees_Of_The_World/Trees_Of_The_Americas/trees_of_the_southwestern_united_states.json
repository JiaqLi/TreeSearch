Oak woodland is widespread at lower elevations in [[coastal California]]; in interior valleys of the [[Coast Ranges]], [[Transverse Ranges]] and [[Peninsular Ranges]]; and in a ring around the [[California Central Valley grasslands]]. The dominant trees are oaks, interspersed with other broadleaf and [[conifer]]ous trees, with an understory of [[California native grasses|grasses]], herbs, [[geophyte]]s, and [[California native plants]].\n\n'''Oak savannas''' occur where the oaks are more widely spaced due a combination of lack of available moisture, and [[low-intensity frequent fires]].\n\nThe oak woodlands of [[Southern California]] and coastal [[Northern California]] are dominated by coast live oak (''[[Quercus agrifolia]]''), but also include valley oak ([[Quercus lobata|''Q. lobata'']]), California black oak ([[Quercus kelloggii|''Q. kelloggii'']]), canyon live oak ([[Quercus chrysolepis|''Q. chrysolepis'']]), and other California oaks.

The [[bark]] on younger trees is light grey, thin and covered with [[resin]] blisters. On older trees, it darkens and develops scales and furrows. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, flattened, {{convert|2|-|4.5|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|mm|abbr=on}} wide by {{convert|0.5|mm|abbr=on|2}} thick, matte dark green above, and with two white bands of [[stomata]] below, and slightly notched at the tip.<ref>Flora of North America, 2008</ref> The leaf arrangement is spiral on the shoot, but with each leaf variably twisted at the base so they lie flat to either side of and above the shoot, with none below the shoot. The shoots are orange-red with dense velvety pubescence. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are {{convert|9|\u2013|17|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4|\u2013|6|cm|abbr=on}} broad, dark purple before maturity; the scale bracts are short, and hidden in the closed cone. The winged [[seed]]s are released when the cones disintegrate at maturity about 6\u20137 months after pollination.\n\nPacific silver fir is very closely related to [[Maries' fir]] ''A. mariesii'' from [[Japan]], which is distinguished by its slightly shorter leaves\u2014{{convert|1.5|-|2.5|cm|abbr=on}}\u2014and smaller cones, which are {{convert|5|\u2013|11|cm|abbr=on}} long.\n\n==Uses==\nThe [[wood]] is soft and not very strong; it is used for [[paper]] making, packing crates and other cheap construction work. The foliage has an attractive scent and is sometimes used for [[Christmas]] decoration, including [[Christmas tree]]s.\n\nIt is also planted as an [[ornamental tree]] in large parks, though its requirement for cool, humid summers limits the areas where it grows well; successful growth away from its native range is restricted to areas like western [[Scotland]] and southern [[New Zealand]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:PacificSilverFir_7644.jpg|Foliage bottom\nFile:PacificSilverFir_7785.jpg|Foliage top\nFile:Abies amabilis 26395.JPG|Cone growth\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*{{IUCN2013.2| assessor=Farjon, A.| year=2013| id= 42271| title=Abies amabilis| downloaded=2 May 2014}}\n*[http://www.conifers.org/pi/Abies_amabilis.php Gymnosperm Database: ''Abies amabilis'' (2011)]\n*[http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_info.asp?thingid=82383 C.Michael Hogan (2008) ''Aesculus californica'', Globaltwitcher.com, ed.

The [[bark]] is reddish-brown with wrinkles, lines and [[resin]] vesicles ('blisters'). The branches are downswept. The needle-like [[leaf|leaves]] are arranged spirally on the shoot, but twisted at the base to spread either side of the shoot in two moderately forward-pointing ranks with a 'v' gap above the shoot; hard and stiff with a sharply pointed tip, 3.5\u20136&nbsp;cm long and 2.5\u20133&nbsp;mm broad, with two bright white [[stomata]]l bands on the underside. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are ovoid, 6\u20139&nbsp;cm long (to 12&nbsp;cm including the bracts), and differ from other firs in that the [[bract]]s end in very long, spreading, yellow-brown bristles 3\u20135&nbsp;cm long; they disintegrate in autumn to release the winged [[seed]]s. The male ([[pollen]]) cones are 2&nbsp;cm long, shedding pollen in spring.\n\nA popular ornamental, it can be seen in many arboreta.\n\n==References==\n* {{IUCN2006|assessor=Conifer Specialist Group|year=1998|id=34019|title=Abies bracteata|downloaded=11 May 2006}}\n*[http://www.conifers.org/pi/Abies_bracteata.php Gymnosperm Database: ''Abies bracteata'']\n*[http://www.pinetum.org/sp/ABbracteata.htm Photos of foliage]\n\n==Further reading==\n*Rogers, David [http://www.ventanawild.org/news/fe98/slfirs.html ''Perfect Pattern of Silvan Perfection on the Symmetrical Plan, the Rare Santa Lucia Fir''] (1998)\n*{{cite journal|last1=Ledig|first1=F.Thomas|last2=Hodgskiss|first2=Paul D.|last3=Johnson|first3=David R.|title=Genetic diversity and seed production in Santa Lucia fir (Abies bracteata), a relict of the Miocene Broadleaved Evergreen Forest|journal=Conservation Genetics|date=June 2006|volume=7|issue=3|pages=383\u2013398|doi=10.1007/s10592-005-9049-x}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-calrecnum=2 CalFlora Database: ''Abies bracteata'' (Santa Lucia fir)]\n*[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_IJM.pl?tid=11522 Jepson Flora Project Treatment: ''Abies bracteata'']\n*[http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/abies-bracteata-bristlecone-fir-native-range-map.php Plantmaps.com: Interactive Distribution Map of ''Abies bracteata'']\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Abies|bracteata]]\n[[Category:Endemic flora of California]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the California chaparral and woodlands]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the California Coast Ranges]]\n[[Category:Santa Lucia Range]]\n[[Category:Natural history of Monterey County, California]]\n[[Category:Natural history of San Luis Obispo County, California]]\n[[Category:Monterey Ranger District, Los Padres National Forest|~]]\n[[Category:Conservation dependent plants]]",

''concolor'']]\nAs treated here, there are two [[subspecies]]; these are also variously treated at either the lower rank of [[variety (biology)|variety]] by some authors, or as distinct [[species]] by others:\n\n====''Abies concolor'' subsp. ''concolor''====\n* '''''Abies concolor'' subsp. ''concolor''''' \u2014 '''Colorado white fir''' or '''Rocky Mountains white fir'''. In the [[United States]], at altitudes of {{convert|1700|\u2013|3400|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[Rocky Mountains]] from southern [[Idaho]], south through [[Utah]] and [[Colorado]], to [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]], and on the higher [[Great Basin]] mountains of [[Nevada]] and extreme southeastern [[California]], and a short distance into northern [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]]. A smaller tree to {{convert|25|\u2013|35|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall, rarely {{convert|45|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}}. Foliage strongly upcurved to erect on all except weak shaded shoots in the lower crown; leaves mostly {{convert|3.5|\u2013|6|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}}, and strongly glaucous on the upper side with numerous stomata. Tolerates winter [[temperature]]s down to about {{convert|-40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.\n\n====''Abies concolor'' subsp. ''lowiana''====\n* '''''Abies concolor'' subsp. ''lowiana''''' ([[syn.]] ''Abies lowiana'') \u2014 '''Low's white fir''' or '''Sierra Nevada white fir'''. In the [[United States]], at altitudes of {{convert|900|\u2013|2700|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] of central [[Oregon]] south through [[California]] ([[Klamath Mountains]], [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]) to northern [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]]. A larger tree to {{convert|40|\u2013|60|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall. Foliage flattened on lower crown shoots, the leaves often raised above the shoot on upper crown shoots but not often strongly upcurved; leaves mostly {{convert|2.5|\u2013|5|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}}, and only weakly glaucous on the upper side with few or no stomata. Tolerates winter temperatures down to about {{convert|-30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Related species===\nWhite fir is very closely related to [[grand fir]] (''Abies grandis''), with subspecies ''lowiana'' being particularly similar to the interior variety of grand fir ''A. grandis'' var. ''idahoensis'', intergrading with it where they meet in the Cascades of central Oregon. To the south in Mexico, it is replaced by further close relatives, [[Durango fir]] (''A. durangensis'') and [[Mexican fir]] (''A. mexicana'').\n...\n\n==Forest succession==\nWhite fir, being shade tolerant, is a [[climax species]] in forest succession in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and in the presence of modern human controls against forest fires, it has flourished over the past two centuries. It is sometimes regarded as a pest by those in the lumber industry, as it drives out trees of greater stature (such as the [[sugar pine]] and [[incense cedar]]), has weaker, knottier wood than its competitors, and retains its lower limbs. This latter trait creates a fire ladder that allows flames to reach up to the canopy, thinning out [[giant sequoia]] stands that would escape smaller forest fires with minimal damage.<ref>[http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/science/hartesveldt/chap6.htm The Giant Sequoia of the Sierra Nevada] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022031750/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/science/hartesveldt/chap6.htm |date=October 22, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n== Discovery ==\nThis tree was discovered by [[William Lobb]] on his expedition to California of 1849\u20131853, having been overlooked previously by [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]].<ref>{{cite book | author= Toby Musgrave | author2= Chris Gardner | author3= Will Musgrave | last-author-amp= yes | title=The Plant Hunters| publisher=[[Orion Publishing Group|Seven Dials]] | year=1999|page=147| isbn=1-84188-001-9}}</ref><ref>Hildebrand, Friedrich Hermann Gustav.

It is a major constituent of the [[Ecology of the North Cascades#Grand Fir/Douglas Fir ecoregion|Grand Fir/Douglas Fir Ecoregion]] of the [[Cascade Range]].\n\nThe tree typically grows to 40\u201370 m in height. There are two [[variety (biology)|varieties]], the taller '''coast grand fir,''' found west of the Cascade Mountains, and the shorter '''interior grand fir''', found east of the Cascades. It was first described in 1831 by [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]].<ref name=\"whitefir\"/>\n\nIt is closely related to [[white fir]]. The bark has historical medicinal properties, and it is popular in the United States as a [[Christmas tree]]. Its [[lumber]] is a [[softwood]], and it is harvested as a '''hem fir'''. It is used in paper-making, as well as construction for [[Framing (construction)|framing]] and flooring, where it is desired for its resistance to splitting and splintering.\n\n==Description==\n{{double image|left|Abies grandis 5357.JPG|203|Abies grandis 5359.JPG|90|The bottom (left) and top (right) of the foliage}}\nThe grand fir was first described by Scottish botanical explorer [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]], who in 1831 collected specimens of the tree along the [[Columbia River]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]].<ref name=\"whitefir\"/>\n\n''Abies grandis'' is a large [[evergreen]] [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] [[tree]] growing to 40&ndash;70&nbsp;m (exceptionally 100&nbsp;m) tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 2&nbsp;m. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, flattened, 3\u20136&nbsp;cm long and 2&nbsp;mm wide by 0.5&nbsp;mm thick, glossy dark green above, and with two green-white bands of [[stomata]] below, and slightly notched at the tip. The leaf arrangement is spiral on the shoot, but with each leaf variably twisted at the base so they all lie in two more-or-less flat ranks on either side of the shoot. On the lower leaf surface, two green-white bands of stomata are prominent. The base of each leaf is twisted a variable amount so that the leaves are nearly [[Coplanarity|coplanar]]. Different length leaves, but all lined up in a flat plane, is a useful way to quickly distinguish this species. [[File:Abies grandis cones.jpg|thumb|left|Cones]] The [[conifer cone|cones]] are 6&ndash;12&nbsp;cm long and 3.5&ndash;4.5&nbsp;cm broad, with about 100-150 scales; the scale bracts are short, and hidden in the closed cone.

A smaller, slow-growing tree to 40\u201345&nbsp;m tall. Foliage not strongly flattened on all shoots, the leaves often raised above the shoot, particularly on upper crown shoots. Cones slightly stouter (mostly over 4&nbsp;cm broad), with thicker, slightly woody scales. Tolerates winter temperatures down to about -40&nbsp;\u00b0C; growth on good sites not exceeding 0.6&nbsp;m per year even when young.<ref name=\"one\"/>\n\nGrand fir is very closely related to [[white fir]], with the interior variety ''idahoensis'' particularly similar to the western forms of white fir from western Oregon and California, intergrading with it where they meet in the Cascades of central Oregon.<ref name=\"one\"/>\n\n==Uses==\nThe inner bark of the grand fir was used by some [[Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau|Plateau Indian]] tribes for treating [[common cold|cold]]s and [[fever]].<ref name=\"hunn\"/> The foliage has an attractive [[citrus]]-like scent, and is sometimes used for [[Christmas]] decorations in the United States, including [[Christmas tree]]s. It is also planted as an ornamental tree in large parks.\n\n===Timber===\n[[File:Abies grandis cross section.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Trunk cross-section]]\nThe lumber is non-resinous and fine textured.<ref name=\"whitefir\"/>\nIn the North American [[logging]] industry, the grand fir is often referred to as \"hem fir\", with hem fir being a blanket term that can be applied to a number of species with interchangeable types of wood (specifically the [[Abies magnifica|California red fir]], [[noble fir]], [[Pacific silver fir]], [[white fir]], and [[western hemlock]]). Grand fir is often shipped along with these other species. It can also referred to as \"white fir\" lumber, an umbrella term also referring to ''[[Abies amabilis]]'', ''[[Abies concolor]]'', and ''[[Abies magnifica]]''.\n\n[[Lumber]] from the grand fir is considered a [[softwood]]. As such, it is used for [[paper]] making, packing crates, and construction. Hem fir is frequently used for [[Framing (construction)|framing]], and is able to meet the [[building code]] [[Span (architecture)|span requirements]] of numerous construction projects.<ref name=\"hefir\"/>\n\nAs a hem fir, the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] of the grand fir is considered slightly below the \"[[Douglas fir]]-[[larch]]\" species combination in strength, and stronger than the \"Douglas fir-South\" and \"spruce-pine-fir (South)\" species combos (both umbrella terms for a number of species with similar wood). Because it is nearly as strong as Douglas fir-larch, it often meets the structural [[load-bearing wall|load-bearing]] requirements for framing in residential, light commercial, and heavy construction. Excluding Douglas fir-larch, hem fir's [[modulus of elasticity]] value as a stiffness factor in floor systems (denoted as MOE or E) is stronger than all other western species combinations. Hem fir is preferred by many builders because of its ability to hold and not be split by nails and screws, and its low propensity for splintering when sawed.<ref name=\"hefir\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist| refs =\n<ref name=\"whitefir\">{{cite news\n| title       = Brochure: White Fir Facts\n| first       = \n| last        = \n| url         = http://www.spi-ind.com/html/documents/brochure-WhiteFirFacts.pdf\n| newspaper   = \n| publisher   = SPI\n| date        = \n| accessdate  = 2012-01-12\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"hunn\">{{cite book |last= Hunn |first= Eugene S. |title= Nch'i-Wana, \"The Big River\": Mid-Columbia Indians and Their Land |publisher=[[University of Washington Press]] |year= 1990 |isbn= 0-295-97119-3| page=351}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"hefir\">{{cite news\n| title       = Hem-Fir species group\n| url         = http://www2.wwpa.org/SPECIESPRODUCTS/HemFir/tabid/299/Default.aspx#char\n| publisher   = Western Woods Products Association\n| date        = March 1997\n| accessdate  = 2012-07-10\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"one\">{{IUCN2006|assessor=Conifer Specialist Group|year=1998|id=42284|title=Abies grandis|downloaded=12 May 2006}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Abies grandis}}\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*[http://www.conifers.org/pi/Abies_grandis.php Gymnosperm Database: ''Abies grandis'']\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ABGR USDA Plants Profile of ''Abies grandis'' (grand fir)]\n*[http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/abies-grandis-grand-fir-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map of ''Abies grandis'']\n*[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_IJM.pl?tid=11526  Jepson eFlora: ''Abies grandis'']\n*[http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-taxon=Abies+grandis CalFlora Database: ''Abies grandis'' (grand fir)]\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Abies grandis}}\n[[Category:Abies|grandis]]\n[[Category:Trees of the West Coast of the United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Cascade Range]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Klamath Mountains]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Rocky Mountains]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the California Coast Ranges]]\n[[Category:Trees of mild maritime climate]]\n[[Category:Trees of humid continental climate]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of California]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]",

''bifolia'', or not distinguished from typical ''A. lasiocarpa'' at all. It occurs in the [[Rocky Mountains]] from southeast Alaska (eastern [[Alaska Range]]) south to Colorado. It differs primarily in [[resin]] composition, and in the fresh leaf scars being yellow-brown, not reddish. The ''Flora of North America'' treats it as a distinct species (see external links, below); the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] includes it within ''A. lasiocarpa'' without distinction.\n*The '''corkbark fir''' ''Abies lasiocarpa'' var. ''arizonica'' occurs in Arizona and New Mexico. It differs in thicker, [[Cork (material)|corky]] [[bark]] and more strongly glaucous foliage. In resin composition it is closer to ''A. bifolia'' than to typical ''A. lasiocarpa'', though the combination \"Abies bifolia var. arizonica\" has not been formally published. The ''Flora of North America'' includes it within ''A. bifolia'' without distinction; the USDA treats it as a distinct variety of ''A. lasiocarpa''.

It is closely related to ''[[Acer saccharum]]'' (sugar maple), and is treated as a [[subspecies]] of it by some botanists, as ''Acer saccharum'' subsp. ''grandidentatum'' (Nutt.) Desmarais.<ref>USDA Plants Profile: [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ACGR3 ''Acer grandidentatum'']</ref><ref name=grin>Germplasm Resources Information Network: [http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?1137 ''Acer saccharum'' subsp. ''grandidentatum'']</ref>\n\n[[Image:Bigtooth Maple Leaves.jpg|left|180px]]\nIt is a small to medium-sized [[deciduous]] [[tree]] growing to 10\u201315 m tall and a trunk of 20\u201335&nbsp;cm diameter. The [[bark]] is dark brown to gray, with narrow fissures and flat ridges creating plate-like scales; it is thin and easily damaged. The [[leaf|leaves]] are opposite, simple, 6\u201312&nbsp;cm long and broad, with three to five deep, bluntly-pointed lobes, three of the lobes large and two small ones (not always present) at the leaf base; the three major lobes each have 3\u20135 small subsidiary lobules. The leaves turn golden yellow to red in fall (this trait is less reliable in warmer areas).\n\nThe [[flower]]s appear with the leaves in mid spring; they are produced in [[corymb]]s of 5\u201315 together, each flower yellow-green, about 4\u20135&nbsp;mm diameter, with no petals. The [[fruit]] is a paired samara (two winged [[seed]]s joined at the base), green to reddish-pink in color, maturing brown in early fall; each seed is globose, 7\u201310&nbsp;mm diameter, with a single wing 2\u20133&nbsp;cm long.\n\n[[Image:Red leaves (Acer grandidentatum) - Little Cottonwood Canyon, Utah (2003).jpg|left|180px]]\nIt commonly grows in [[limestone]] soils but can adapt to a wide range of well-drained soils, from sand to clays to even white limestone areas. It prefers sheltered canyons, valleys, and the banks of mountain streams, primarily at higher elevations but occasionally at lower elevations in disjunct locales such as the southern edge of the [[Edwards Plateau]] in [[Texas]] and in the [[Wichita Mountains]] of [[southwestern Oklahoma]]. Although [[continental climate]]s prevail over all of its natural range, it grows well in the [[maritime climate]] of [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]]. It is slow growing when young, and does not have many pests.\n\nIt is occasionally planted as an ornamental tree, valued for its drought tolerance and ability to grow in rocky landscapes.\n\nOther vernacular names occasionally used include lost maple, Sabinal maple, western sugar maple, Uvalde big tooth maple, canyon maple, southwestern big tooth maple, plateau big tooth maple, limerock maple, Wasatch maple and Rocky Mountain sugar maple.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lost Maples State Natural Area]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{commons|Acer grandidentatum}}\n\n[[Category:Acer|grandidentatum]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Rocky Mountains]]",

In [[Canada]] it is commonly known as [[Manitoba]] maple and occasionally as elf maple. '''Box elder''', '''boxelder maple''', '''ash-leaved maple''', and '''maple ash''' are its most common names in the [[United States]]; in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] it is also known as '''ashleaf maple'''.<ref name=BSBI07>{{cite web|title=BSBI List 2007 |publisher=Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland |url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |format=xls |access-date=2014-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VqJ46atN?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bsbi.org.uk%2FBSBIList2007.xls |archivedate=2015-01-25 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Common names ==\n\nIndicative of its familiarity to many people over a large geographic range, ''A. negundo'' has numerous common names.\n\nThe names \"box elder\" and \"boxelder maple\" are based upon the similarity of its whitish wood to that of [[Buxus|boxwood]] and the similarity of its [[pinnate]]ly compound leaves to those of some species of [[Sambucus|elder]].<ref>[http://www.depauw.edu/univ/naturepark/natural_history/trees/aceraceae/acer_negundo.htm DePauw University]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>   This is the only North American maple with compound leaves, though several Asian species also have them.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book | last=Keeler | first=H. L. | title=Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them | publisher=Charles Scriber's Sons | year=1900 | location=New York | pages=85\u201387 }}</ref>\n\nOther common names are based upon this maple's similarity to [[Fraxinus|ash]], its preferred environment, its [[maple syrup|sugary sap]], a description of its leaves, its [[binomial name]], and so on.  These names include (but are not limited to) ash-, cut-, or three-leaf (or -leaved) maple; ash maple; sugar ash; Negundo maple; and river maple.<ref>[http://www.windsorplywood.com/ Acer spp. Aceraceae] Note that some of the common names given in this reference are questionable.  \"stinking ash\" and \"black ash\" typically refer to ''[[Ptelea trifoliata]]'' and ''[[Fraxinus nigra]]'', respectively.  This reference is retained as an example of the confusion which arises when plants such as ''A. negundo'' are discussed by other than their [[scientific name]]s.</ref>  In [[Canada]] it is commonly known as Manitoba maple and occasionally as elf maple.<ref>[http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/index/commtreesprairies/manitobamaple Community trees of the Prairie provinces&nbsp;\u2013 Canadian Forest Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  In [[Russia]] it is called American maple ({{lang-rus|\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0451\u043d|amerikansky klyon}})<!-- [[Wikipedia:Romanization of Russian]] --> as well as ash-leaf maple ({{lang-rus|\u043a\u043b\u0451\u043d \u044f\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0301\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439|klyon yasenelistny}}), and in Italian ''acero americano''.<ref>[http://luirig.altervista.org/flora/taxa/index2.php?scientific-name=acer+negundo Altervista Italiana, Acero americano, ''Acer negundo'' L.]</ref>\n\nCommon names may also designate a particular [[subspecies]].  For example, a common name for ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''interius'' may be preceded by \"inland\" (as in \"inland boxelder maple\").  A common name for ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''californicum'' may be preceded by \"California\" or \"western\".\n\n[[File:2014-10-11 12 48 07 Box Elder Maple foliage during autumn in Elko, Nevada.JPG|thumb|left|Autumn leaf color]]\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Acer negundo bark-Clapiers~2010 04 05.jpg|thumb|left|Bark of a young ''Acer negundo''.]]\n''Acer negundo'' is a usually fast-growing and fairly short-lived [[tree]] that grows up to {{convert|10|-|25|m|ft|round=5|sp=us}} tall, with a trunk diameter of {{convert|30|-|50|cm|in|0|sp=us}}, rarely up to {{convert|1|m|ft|sp=us}} diameter.  It often has several trunks and can form impenetrable thickets.<ref name=\"gelderen\">van Gelderen, C.J. & van Gelderen, D.M. (1999). ''Maples for Gardens: A Color Encyclopedia''.</ref>\n\nThe shoots are green, often with a whitish to pink or violet [[wax]]y coating when young.  Branches are smooth, somewhat brittle, and tend to retain a fresh green colour rather than forming a [[bark]] of dead, protective tissue.  The bark on its trunks is pale gray or light brown, deeply cleft into broad ridges, and scaly.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nUnlike most other maples (which usually have [[simple leaf|simple]], [[palmate]]ly [[lobed leaf|lobed]] [[leaf|leaves]]), ''Acer negundo'' has [[pinnate]]ly [[compound leaf|compound]] leaves that usually have three to seven leaflets.  Simple leaves are also occasionally present;  technically, these are single-leaflet compound leaves.  Although some other maples (such as ''[[Acer griseum]]'', ''[[Acer mandshuricum]]'' and the closely related [[Acer cissifolium|''A. cissifolium'']]) have [[leaf shape|trifoliate]] leaves, only ''A. negundo'' regularly displays more than three leaflets.\n\nThe leaflets are about {{convert|5|-|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}} long and {{convert|3|-|7|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} wide with slightly serrate margins.  Leaves have a [[translucence|translucent]] light green color and turn yellow in the [[Autumn|fall]].\n\nThe [[flower]]s are small and appear in early spring on drooping [[raceme]]s {{convert|10|-|20|cm|in|0|sp=us}} long.  The [[fruit]]s are paired [[Samara (fruit)|samaras]], each seed slender, {{convert|1|-|2|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long, with a {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} incurved wing; they drop in autumn or they may persist through winter.  Seeds are usually both prolific and [[fertility|fertile]].\n\nUnlike most other maples, ''A. negundo'' is fully [[dioecious]] and both a male and female tree are needed for either to reproduce.\n\n* Winter buds: Terminal buds acute, an eighth of an inch long.  Lateral buds obtuse.  The inner scales enlarge when spring growth begins and often become an inch long before they fall.\n* Flowers: April, before the leaves, yellow green; staminate flowers in clusters on slender hairy pedicels one and a half to two inches long.  Pistillate flowers in narrow drooping racemes.\n* Calyx: Yellow green; staminate flowers campanulate, five-lobed, hairy.  Pistillate flowers smaller, five-parted; disk rudimentary.\n* Corolla: Wanting.\n* Stamens: Four to six, exserted; filaments slender, hairy; anthers linear, connective pointed.\n* Pistil: Ovary hairy, borne on disk, partly enclosed by calyx, two-celled, wing-margined.  Styles separate at base into two stigmatic lobes.\n* Fruit: Maple keys, full size in early summer.  Borne in drooping racemes, pedicels one to two inches long.  Key an inch and a half to two inches long, nutlets diverging, wings straight or incurved.  September.  Seed half an inch long.  Cotyledons, thin, narrow.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\n=== Subspecies ===\n[[File:Acer negundo.jpg|thumb|right|''A. negundo'' leaves and fruits]]\n\n''Acer negundo'' is often discussed as comprising three subspecies, each of which was originally described as a separate species.  These are:\n\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''negundo'' is the main variety and the type to which characteristics described in the article most universally apply.  Its natural range is from the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] to the Rocky Mountains.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''interius'' has more leaf serration than the main species and a more [[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]] leaf surface.  As the name ''interus'' indicates, its natural range of [[Saskatchewan]] to [[New Mexico]] is sandwiched between that of the other two subspecies.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''californicum'' has larger leaves than the main species.  Leaves also have a velvety texture which is essential to distinguish it from ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''negundo''.  It is found in parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]].<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n\nSome authors further subdivide subsp. ''negundo'' into a number of regional varieties but these intergrade and their maintenance as distinct [[taxa]] is disputed by many.  Even the differences between recognized subspecies are probably a matter of gradient [[speciation]].\n\nFinally, note that a few botanists treat boxelder maple as its own distinct genus (''Negundo aceroides'') but this is not widely accepted.\n\n== Distribution ==\nAs noted, varieties thrive across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It may also be found as far south as [[Guatemala]].\n\nAlthough native to [[North America]], it is considered an [[invasive species]] in some areas of that continent. It can quickly [[colonize]] both cultivated and uncultivated areas and the range is therefore expanding both in North America and elsewhere. In Europe where it was introduced in 1688 as a park tree it is able to spread quickly in places and is considered an invasive species in parts of Central Europe (Germany and the Czech Republic, middle Danube, Vistula river valley in Poland) where it can form mass growth in lowlands, disturbed areas and riparian biomes on calcareous soils. It has also become [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] in eastern [[China]]<ref name=\"gelderen\" />  and can be found in some of the cooler areas of the [[Australian continent]] where it is listed as a pest [[invasive species]].\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Acer negundo tree.jpg|thumb|Boxelder, Manitoba Maple. Tree. ND, USA.]]\n\nThis species prefers bright sunlight. It often grows on flood plains and other disturbed areas with ample water supply, such as [[riparian]] habitats. Human influence has greatly favoured this species; it grows around houses and in hedges, as well as on disturbed ground and vacant lots.\n\nSeveral [[bird]]s and some [[squirrel]]s feed on the seeds.  The [[evening grosbeak]] uses them extensively. The [[Maple Bug]] (also known as the Boxelder Bug) lays its [[egg]]s on all maples, but prefers this species.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nAlthough its weak wood, irregular form, and prolific seeding might make it seem like a poor choice for a landscape tree, ''A. negundo'' is one of the most common maples in cultivation and many interesting [[cultivar]]s have been developed, including:<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* 'Auratum'&nbsp;\u2013 yellowish leaves with smooth undersides\n* 'Aureomarginatum'&nbsp;\u2013 creamy yellow leaf margins\n* 'Baron'&nbsp;\u2013 Hardier & seedless variety\n* 'Elegans'&nbsp;\u2013 distinctively convex leaves\n* 'Flamingo'&nbsp;\u2013 pink and white [[variegation]] (very popular)\n* [[Acer negundo 'Pendulum'|'Pendulum']]&nbsp;\u2013 with weeping branches.\n* 'Variegatum'&nbsp;\u2013 creamy white leaf margins\n* 'Violaceum'&nbsp;\u2013 younger shoots and branches have bluish colour\n\n== Uses ==\nAlthough its light, close-grained, soft wood is considered undesirable for most uses, this tree has been considered as a commercial source of wood fiber, for use in [[fiberboard]].\n\nThere is some commercial use of the tree for various decorative applications, such as turned items (bowls, stem-ware, pens). Primarily burl wood and injured wood, where the primary reason is this wood's reaction to injury, where the injured wood develops a red stain.\n\n=== Use by Native Americans ===\nThe [[Navajo people|Navajo]] use the wood to make tubes for bellows.<ref>Elmore, Francis H. 1944 Ethnobotany of the Navajo.

It typically is multi-trunked, with a crown as broad as it is high. Trees are long lived, with an estimated lifespan between 250-280 (300 maximum) years. The [[Leaf|leaves]] are dark green, [[Compound leaf|palmately compound]] with five (rarely seven) leaflets. Each leaflet is {{Convert|6-17|cm|abbr = on}} long, with a finely toothed margin and (particularly in spring) downy surfaces. The leaves are tender and prone to damage from both spring freezing or snow and summer heat and [[desiccation]].\n\nThe [[flower]]s are sweet-scented, white to pale pink, borne on erect [[panicle]]s {{Convert|15-20|cm|4 = 0|abbr = on}} long and {{Convert|5-8|cm|4 = 0|abbr = on}} broad.

Its range extends to the foothills of the [[Siskiyou Mountains]] in the [[Rogue Valley]] in Oregon.\n\nIt is found growing in a wide range of conditions from crowded, moist, semi-shaded canyon bottoms to dry south-facing slopes and hilltops. In the coastal ranges north of Big Sur it is found growing alone on slopes, or intermingled with valley oak (''[[Quercus lobata]]''), Oregon oak (''[[Quercus garryana|Q. garryana]]''), coast live oak (''[[Quercus agrifolia|Q. agrifolia]]'') and California bay laurel (''[[Umbellularia californica]]''). In the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, ''A. californica'' can be found standing alone in grassland at the lowest elevations, intermingled in [[California oak woodland|blue oak woodlands]] at intermediate elevations, and in mixed evergreen forests of black oak (''[[Quercus kelloggii|Q. kelloggii]]''), gray pine (''[[Pinus sabiniana]]''), ponderosa pine (''[[Pinus ponderosa|P. ponderosa]]'') and interior live oak (''[[Quercus wislizeni|Q. wislizeni]]'') as it nears the limit of its range.\n\n==Toxicity and uses==\n[[File:Aesculus californica-29.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Seed of the California Buckeye in its husk]]\nLocal Native American tribes, including the [[Pomo people|Pomo]], [[Yokut people|Yokut]], and [[Luise\u00f1o people|Luise\u00f1o]], used the poisonous nuts to stupefy schools of fish in small streams to make them easier to catch.<ref>{{cite book |title=A California Flora |authors=Philip Alexander Munz, David D.

Buckeye also makes a good fireboard for a [[bow drill]] or hand drill.\n\nNative groups occasionally used the nuts as a food supply when the acorn supply was sparse; after boiling and leaching the toxin out of the nut meats for several days, they could be ground into a meal similar to that made from acorns.  The nectar of the flowers is toxic to the Asian/European [[honeybee]], so the trees should not be planted near apiaries.<ref>{{cite report |title=California Buckeye, in the USDA NRCS Plant Guide |authors=Kat Anderson, Wayne Roderick |publisher=USDA |url=http://plants.usda.gov/plantguide/pdf/cs_aeca.pdf |accessdate=2011-06-20 }}</ref> When the shoots are small and leaves are new, they are lower in toxins and are grazed by livestock and wildlife.<ref>{{cite report |title=Aesculus californica, in the USDA Forest Service Fire Effects Information System |authors=Howard, Janet L.|publisher=USDA Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/aescal/all.html|accessdate=2011-11-07 }}</ref> The flowers are a rich nectar source for many species of butterflies.<ref>{{cite report |title=Watching Butterflies on Mount Diablo|authors=Kevin Hintsa|publisher=|url=http://www.mdia.org/Wildlife/wbutterfly.htm|accessdate=2011-11-07 }}</ref>\n\nIt is used as an ornamental plant for its striking leaf buds, lime green foliage, fragrant white flowers, red-brown foliage in mid to late summer, and architectural silver branches through fall.\n\nThe tree acts as a soil binder, which prevents [[erosion]] in hilly regions.\n\n==Etymology==\n'Aesculus' is [[Linnaeus]]' name for horse chestnuts.

It is always on or near the coast.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://eol.org/pages/991103/details|title= Pinus muricata_Bishop Pine_EOL}}</ref>\n\nIn San Luis Obispo County it is found alone or in stands scattered on the coastal mountains and hills from [[Morro Bay]] to [[Shell Beach, Pismo Beach|Shell Beach]]. A few stands of the tree are seen on the hills above the Sycamore Canyon Resort in [[Avila Beach]]. Within the City of [[San Luis Obispo]], the Terrace Hill Open Space has several scattered specimens. Bishop pine seems to prefer already disturbed, unvegetated areas where it probably faces less competition from oaks and shrubs.\n\nThe common name \"bishop pine\" resulted from the tree having been first identified near the [[Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa|Mission of San Luis Obispo]] in [[San Luis Obispo]], California. This tree has a large number of common names and other prior scientific names, due primarily to numerous variant forms. Other English names that have occasionally been used are: prickle cone pine, Obispo pine, Santa Cruz pine and dwarf marine pine.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Growing tip of Pinus muricata.JPG|thumb|left|Growing tip of Bishop Pine, showing male cones and the long paired needles]]\n\n''Pinus muricata'' is a [[pinophyta|coniferous]] [[evergreen]] [[tree]] growing to a height of 15\u201325 m,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/pinmur/all.html#28|title= Pinus muricata_BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS}}</ref> rarely up to 34 m, with a trunk diameter of up to 1.2 m. The [[species]] is often smaller, stunted and twisted in coastal exposures. It is drought-tolerant and grows on dry, rocky soil.\n\nThe needles are in pairs, green to blue-green, and {{convert|8|\u2013|16|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long. [[Conifer cone|Cone]]s occur in one to five clusters.<ref>W.L. Jepson, 1909</ref> The cones are strongly reflexed down the branch, 5\u201310&nbsp;cm long; the scales are stiff, thin on the side of the cone facing the stem, but greatly thickened on the side facing away and with a stout 5\u201312&nbsp;mm spine; both features adaptive to minimise [[squirrel]] predation and fire damage to the cones. The cones remain unopened for many years until fire or strong heat causes them to open and release the seeds.<ref name=\"Moore2008\">{{cite book|author1=Moore, Gerry |author2=Kershner, Bruce |author3=Craig Tufts |author4=Daniel Mathews |author5=Gil Nelson |author6=Spellenberg, Richard |author7=Thieret, John W. |author8=Terry Purinton |author9=Block, Andrew |title=National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Trees of North America |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |year=2008 |page=90 |isbn=1-4027-3875-7}}</ref>\n\n==Forms==\n[[Image:Pinus muricata wiki 2.jpg|thumb|right|Growth habit]]\n\nThere are two ''Pinus muricata'' forms: \n* a southern form with bright green needles\n* a northern form with dark blue-green needles.\n\nThe [[resin]] composition also differs. The dividing line between the two is very sharp, five miles (8&nbsp;km) south of the boundary between Mendocino County and Sonoma County, California. Experimental attempts to hybridize the two forms have consistently failed, indicating that their taxonomic relationship may be more distant than the very small differences in appearance would suggest.\n\n==Ecology==\nBishop pine is found with several oak and cypress associates within the [[California Coast Ranges]]. There are also a number of common [[understory]] flora associates including [[Polystichum munitum|Sword Fern]], [[salal]] and [[Western Poison Oak]].<ref>C.M. Hogan, 2008</ref> Notable occurrences of Bishop pine is in association with [[Mendocino Cypress]] as a [[pygmy forest]] on coastal terraces in Mendocino County and Sonoma County, including one location within [[Salt Point State Park]]. It is classified an [[endangered species]] in Mexico.\n\n==Uses==\n''Pinus muricata'' has been used in [[plantation]]s with resultant growth rates higher than in the wild, but with adverse impacts to [[biodiversity]].\n\nThis plant has ornamental value, and is cultivated in parks and gardens.

[[Nymph (biology)|Nymphs]] of the [[pineapple gall adelgid]] form galls at the base of twigs which resemble miniature pineapples and those of the [[Gall adelgid|Cooley's spruce gall adelgid]] cause cone-shaped galls at the tips of branches. The larva of the [[spruce budworm]] eat the buds and growing shoots while the [[spruce needle miner]] hollows out the needles and makes them coalesce in a webbed mass. An elongated white [[scale insect]], the [[Chionaspis pinifoliae|pine needle scale]] feeds on the needles causing fluffy white patches on the twigs and aphids also suck sap from the needles and may cause them to fall and possibly dieback. Mites can also infest the blue spruce, especially in a dry summer, causing yellowing of the oldest needles.<ref name=IFAS>{{cite web |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/st453 |title=''Picea pungens'': Colorado Spruce |author1=Gilman, Edward F. |author2=Watson, Dennis G. |date=2011-05-01 |work=EDIS |publisher=IFAS Extension Service: University of Florida |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/insect/05514.html |title=Scale Insects Affecting Conifers |author=Cranshaw, W.

Various rust diseases also affect the tree causing yellowing of the needles as well as needle fall. [[Canker]] caused by ''[[Cytospora]]'' attacks one of the lower branches first and progressively makes its way higher up the tree. The first symptom is the needles turning reddish-brown and falling off. Meanwhile, patches of white [[resin]] appear on the bark and the branch eventually dies.<ref name=IFAS/>\n\n===Cultivars===\n[[File:Picea pungens 'Glauca globosa' in Autumn.JPG|thumb|Foliage of the cultivar 'Glauca globosa']]\n\nCommon cultivars (those marked {{smallcaps|agm}} have gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]]):- \n*'Glauca Globosa'{{smallcaps|agm}}<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Picea pungens'' 'Globosa'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1465|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref> - shrub from {{convert|3|-|5|ft|m}} in height<ref>[http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/c825/picea-pungens-glauca-globosa.aspx Missouri Botanical Garden: ''Picea pungens'' 'Glauca Globosa']</ref> \n*'Fat Albert' - compact perfect cone to {{convert|10|ft|m}} of a silver blue color<ref>[http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/e660/picea-pungens-fat-albert.aspx Missouri Botanical Garden: ''Picea pungens'' Fat Albert]</ref>\n*'Glauca Jean's Dilly' - shrub from {{convert|3|-|6|ft|m}} in height<ref>[http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/a421/picea-glauca-jean's-dilly.aspx Missouri Botanical Garden: ''Picea pungens'' 'Glauca Jean's Dilly']</ref>\n*'Glauca Pendula' - drooping branches, spreads to about {{convert|8|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|4|ft|m}} tall<ref>[http://www.finegardening.com/plantguide/picea-pungens-glauca-pendula-colorado-blue-spruce.aspx Fine Gardening Plant Guide: Picea pungens \u2018Glauca Pendula']</ref>\n*'Hoopsii' {{smallcaps|agm}}<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Picea pungens'' 'Hoopsii'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1466|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>\n*'Koster'<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Picea pungens'' 'Koster'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1467|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>\n*'Baby Blue Eyes'<ref>{{cite web|title=Missouri Botanical Garden - ''Picea pungens 'Baby Blueeyes'| url=http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/d137/picea-pungens-baby-blueeyes.aspx}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Washington State University - ''Picea pungens 'Baby Blueeyes'| url=http://www.pnwplants.wsu.edu/PlantDisplay.aspx?PlantID=243}}</ref>\n*'Baby Blue' <ref>{{cite web|title=West Montrose Farms Ltd - ''Picea pungens 'Baby Blue'| url=http://www.babybluespruce.com/}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nThe [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Keresan languages|Keres]] Native Americans used this tree as a traditional [[medicinal plant]] and a ceremonial item, and twigs are given as gifts to bring good fortune.

''Calocedrus'' differs from ''Thuja'' in the scale leaves being in apparent whorls of four (actually opposite decussate pairs like ''Thuja'', but not evenly spaced apart as in ''Thuja'', instead with the successive pairs closely then distantly spaced), and in the [[conifer cone|cones]] having just 2\u20133 pairs of moderately thin, erect scales, rather than 4\u20136 pairs of very thin scales in ''Thuja''.\n[[Image:Calocedrus decurrens 7976.jpg|thumb|right|''C. decurrens'' foliage and male cones]]\n\n==Species==\n\n===''Calocedrus decurrens''===\n''[[Calocedrus decurrens]]'', California incense cedar (syn. ''Libocedrus decurrens''), is native to western [[North America]]. It is a large tree, typically reaching heights of 40\u201360 m and a trunk diameter of up to 3 m (maxima, 69 m tall and 3.9 m diameter), and with a broad conic crown of spreading branches. The leaves are bright green on both sides of the shoots, and the cones 2\u20132.5&nbsp;cm long. It is by far the most widely known species in the genus, and is often simply called \"incense cedar\" without the regional qualifier.\n\n===''Calocedrus formosana''===\n''[[Calocedrus formosana]]'', Taiwan incense cedar, is [[endemic]] to [[Taiwan]]. It is very similar to ''C. macrolepis'', and some botanists treat it as a variety of that, ''C. macrolepis'' var. ''formosana''. It is a medium-sized tree, growing to 25\u201330 m tall, and is rare in the wild, occurring only as scattered trees in mixed forests. The leaves are glaucous green on the upper side of the shoots, and conspicuously marked with bright white stomatal patches on the underside. The cones are 1.5\u20132&nbsp;cm long, carried on a 1\u20131.5&nbsp;cm stem.<ref>[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=200005407 Flora of China Vol. 4 Page 65 <big>\u53f0\u6e7e\u7fe0\u67cf</big> tai wan cui bai ''Calocedrus macrolepis'' var.

It is also a medium-size tree to 25\u201330 m tall, and like ''C. formosana'', is rare in the wild.

It occurs exclusively on rocky limestone ([[karst]]) terrain, a habitat that has a very high level of endemism. The close proximity of these populations to the [[China|Chinese]] and [[Laos|Laotian]] borders indicates that the species may occur in those countries as well. It is an evergreen, monoecious tree up to 25 m tall with a broadly rounded crown. The epithet \"rupestris\" means \"rock-dwelling\".<ref>Averyanov, H.T. Nguyen & L.K. Phan.

''Calocedrus suleticensis'' is known from a cone.\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Lumber===\nThe [[wood]] of ''Calocedrus'' is soft, moderately decay-resistant, and with a strong spicy-resinous fragrance. That of ''C. decurrens'' is the primary material for wooden [[pencil]]s, because it is soft and tends to sharpen easily without forming splinters. The two Asian species were (at least in the past) in very high demand for [[coffin]] manufacture in China, due to the scent of the wood and its decay resistance. It is likely that past [[over-exploitation]] is responsible for their current rarity.\n\nIncense cedar was the preferred [[Bow drill|hearth board]] of the Native Peoples of [[Northern California]] for [[Firelighting|lighting fires]] by friction .\n\n===Cultivation===\n''Calocedrus decurrens'', the California incense cedar, is a popular [[ornamental tree]], grown particularly in locations with cool summer climates like [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[British Columbia]]. Its very narrow columnar crown in landscape settings, an unexplained consequence of the climatic conditions in these areas, is not shown by trees in their native 'wild' [[habitat]]. The California incense cedar is also valued for its [[drought]] tolerance. The Asian species are rarely cultivated.<ref>Munz, P. A. 1974. Flora of Southern California 1\u20131086.

This disease is also a problem for horticultural plantings in some parts of North America. The tree is sometimes killed, though less often, by other species of ''[[Phytophthora]]''.\n\n''Phytophthora lateralis'' infection begins when mycelium, from a germinated spore, invade the roots. The infection then spreads through the inner bark and cambium around the base of the tree. Spread up the trunk is generally limited. Infected tissue dies and effectively girdles the tree. Large trees are more likely to be infected than small trees due to larger root areas (although all trees at the edges of infected streams will eventually succumb). However, large trees can often live with the infections for a longer duration (up to several years).\n\n''C. lawsoniana'' in streamside populations are highly susceptible to ''Phytophthora lateralis'' infection. However, the rate of ''Phytophthora'' spread through populations in dry upland areas appears to be slow. ''Phytophthora lateralis'' spreads through water via mobile spores ([[zoospore]]s). The fungus also produces resting spores ([[chlamydospore]]s) that can persist in soil for a long period of time. New infections generally begin when soil is transferred from an infected population to a non-infected population via human or animal movement. After initial infection in streamside populations, secondary spread via zoospores quickly infects all downstream individuals.\n\nHuman facilitated spread is thought to be responsible for most new, and all long-distance, infections. Soil on vehicle tires, especially logging trucks and other off road vehicles, is considered the most pressing problem due to the volume of soil that can be carried and the traffic rate in and between susceptible areas. Spread on boots and mountain bike tires has also been suggested and probably contributes to new infections locally.<ref>{{cite news |title=Roads in the Six Rivers National Forest close to prevent spread of root disease |newspaper=[[Times-Standard]] |location=Eureka, CA |first=Tabitha |last=Soden |date=October 19, 2015 |access-date=8 September 2016 |url=http://www.times-standard.com/article/NJ/20151019/NEWS/151019809 }}</ref> Animal facilitated spread is thought to occur, but is localized.\n\nThe [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) and [[United States Forest Service]] ([[USFS]]) attempt to prevent ''Phytophthora'' spread through road closures, monitoring, research and education.

It is commonly seen in [[Arroyo (creek)|washes]] and [[Riparian zone|along riverbanks]] at elevations below 1800m in its range.\n\n==Description==\nRanging from 1.5 to as much as 8 meters in height, it can take the form of a shrub or small tree. The linear, curved, [[deciduous]] leaves are 10 to 26&nbsp;cm long and just a few millimeters wide.\n{{commons|Chilopsis linearis}}\nThe generic name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''\u03c7\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2'', (''cheilos''), meaning \"lip,\" and ''\u1f44\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2'' (''opsis''), meaning \"resembling,\" referring to the [[flower]]s. They occur in a terminal [[panicle]] or [[raceme]], blooming in May through September. About two to four flowers at a time are open in each inflorescence. The [[sepal|calyx]] is about 8\u201314&nbsp;mm, slightly inflated, and varying shades of purple, while the [[Petal#Corolla|corolla]] is 2\u20135&nbsp;cm, and with colors ranging from lavender to light pink. The throat and lower lip has a pattern of yellow ridges and purple lines, and the margins are crinkled. It is pollinated primarily by large [[bee]]s in the family [[Apidae]], such as [[carpenter bee]]s, [[bumblebee]]s, ''[[Anthophora]]'', and ''[[Centris]]''. The [[fruit]] is a linear pod up to 35&nbsp;cm long, containing numerous winged [[seed]]s.\n\nThere are two [[subspecies]]:\n*''Chilopsis linearis'' subsp. ''linearis''. Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, western Texas, Mexico. \n*''Chilopsis linearis'' subsp. ''arcuata''. Nevada, California, Baja California.\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n\nIt is cultivated for its large, showy [[flower]]s, and tolerance of hot, dry climates. Although the natural growth is a very irregular shape, it can be readily pruned into a conventional tree shape. A number of [[cultivar]]s have been selected. Some, such as 'Rio Salado', have dark purple or magenta flowers.\n\nChilopsis may survive temperatures as low as 10 degrees F (-12&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\n''Chilopsis'' is closely related to the genus ''[[Catalpa]]'' and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] can be made between the two genera.

''forbesii''. This taxonomy has been somewhat controversial, as morphology and molecular testing have both shown ''[[Cupressus guadalupensis]]'' to be genetically distinct enough from ''Cupressus forbesii'' to warrant being placed in its own species. ''[[Cupressus guadalupensis]]'' is [[endemism|endemic]] to [[Guadalupe Island]] off Baja California, two hundred fifty miles away from any ''C.&nbsp;forbesii'' stands. Molecular testing has shown ''Cupressus guadalupensis'' to be slightly more closely related to ''[[Cupressus stephensonii]]''. \n\nMajor differences between Tecate cypress (''Cupressus forbesii'') and Guadalupe cypress (''Cupressus guadalupensis'') are: \n*Guadalupe cypress, when mature, makes a much more massive and taller tree than Tecate cypress. \n*Guadalupe cypress has glaucous, somewhat blue-tinted foliage, while Tecate cypress has very green foliage. \n*Guadalupe cypress cones will open without fire, while Tecate cypress cones differ from any other species of California Cypress, in that even once disconnected from the parent tree, they will not open without heat.\n\n==Ecology==\nThe Tecate cypress is the only plant on which the rare [[Callophrys gryneus|Thorne's Hairstreak]] (''Callophrys gryneus thornei'') lays its eggs.<ref name=butterfly>Lee, M.

A Tecate Cypress planted at [[Strybing Arboretum]] in San Francisco is showing vigor and produces viable cones at forty years of age.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*[[California chaparral and woodlands]] - (''ecoregion'')\n*[[California montane chaparral and woodlands]]- (''subecoregion'')\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Little, D.P. 2006.

In Mendocino County the occurrence is in a discontinuous [[coast]]al terrace strip, primarily as a pygmy forest associated with [[Bishop Pine]] (''Pinus muricata'') and [[Lodgepole Pine|Mendocino Shore Pine]] (''P. contorta var. bolanderi''). Occurrences are typically below 500&nbsp;m in elevation.<ref name=jepson/> The Mendocino County official [[soil]]s survey states that \"While not formally recognized as a major forest cover type, the coastal portion of the survey area also includes Bishop Pine and Mendocino Cypress (pygmy) forest types\".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ca.nrcs.usda.gov/mlra02/wmendo/woodland.html |title= Woodland Management and Productivity |accessdate=2006-11-23 |year= 1993|work= Soil Survey of Mendocino County, California, Western Part|publisher= National Cooperative Soil Survey}}</ref>\n\n==Productivity==\nAlong the Mendocino coastal terraces, whose geological age is approximately one million years, studies have been conducted of the biomass density and [[primary productivity]] of the ''Cupressus pygmaea''-dominated pygmy forest.<ref>Westman, W.

Mean below-ground values are 3.5&nbsp;kilograms biomass per square meter, productivity being 402&nbsp;grams per meter per annum.

It is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[California]], where it is known from [[Mendocino County]] southwards to [[Santa Barbara County]].  This taxon is limited to  the [[Coast Ranges (California)|Coast Range]] mountains. It grows in [[temperate coniferous forest|forests]] with other conifers, as well as [[chaparral]] and other local mountain habitat, usually in pure stands on [[serpentine soil]]s. It generally grows 10 to 15 meters (33-50 feet) tall, but it is known to exceed 22 meters (73 feet). On Carson Ridge in [[Marin County]], as well as [[Hood Mountain]] in [[Sonoma County]], the species comprises a pygmy forest of trees which do not attain heights greater than 240-360 cm (8-12 feet) due to high mineral concentrations in the [[serpentine soil]]. <ref name=biohere>[http://www.biohere.com/natural_areas/california/Sonoma_County/hood_mountain_park.php Biohere, Hood Mountain Park]</ref> \n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cupressus sargentii Hood Mountain.JPG|left|thumb|Trunk of Sargent Cypress in Pygmy forest on Hood Mountain Sonoma County {{deletable image-caption}}]] -->\n\nOne notable population occurs in the Cedar Mountain Ridge area of Eastern [[Alameda County]]. According to Carl Wolf, who extensively studied the New World Cypress in the 1930s and 1940s, seed from the Cedar Mountain stand of ''Cupressus sargentii'' produced the most vigorous seedlings.\n\nLike many of the New World [[Cupressaceae]], Sargent Cypress usually reproduces with the aid of wildfire, which cause an opening of the cones and exposure of bare mineral soil for seedling germination, though occasionally seeds will fall and germinate without fire, though such seems to be the exception rather than the rule. It is often the case that many trees in a particular stand will all be the same age, so that a sort of stratification occurs of different colonies all of the same age. Sargent Cypress can begin producing cones as early as five or six years of age. <ref>Wolf, C. B. & Wagener, W. E. (1948). The New World cypresses.

Group I plants are strandline shrubs growing from north-eastern [[Queensland]] to the [[New South Wales]] border. This [[clade]] has a number of genetically divergent lineages (I:a,b,c,d,e,f,g,). It is identified that subclade Ib shared a last common ancestor with subclade Ia in the mid-Pleistocene, 0.5\u20131.2 Ma. The Group II plants of D. viscosa is present almost everywhere on the continent. Group II has at least three evolutionary lineages (II a, b and c), which distributions generally overlap. According to West <ref>West J.G. A revision of Dodonaea Miller (Sapindaceae) in Australia. Brunonia 7, 1\u2013194. 1984</ref> these subspecies have morphological intergradation, particularly in the higher-rainfall regions of Australia, but not in the arid zone, where they generally overlap.

One variety, the coast Douglas fir, grows along the Pacific Ocean from central [[British Columbia]] south to central [[California]]. A second variety, the Rocky Mountain Douglas fir, grows in the [[Rocky Mountains]] from British Columbia south to [[Mexico]]. The tree is dominant in western [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. It is extensively used for timber, worldwide.\n\n== Naming ==\nThe common name honors [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]], a Scottish botanist and collector who first reported the extraordinary nature and potential of the species. The common name is misleading since it is not a true fir, i.e., not a member of the genus ''[[Abies]]''. For this reason the name is often written as '''Douglas-fir''' (a name also used for the genus ''[[Pseudotsuga]]'' as a whole).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oregonstate.edu/trees/conifer_genera/douglas_fir.html |title=Douglas-fir (''Pseudotsuga'') |work=Common Trees of the Pacific Northwest |publisher=Oregon State University |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe specific epithet, ''menziesii'', is after [[Archibald Menzies]], a Scottish physician and rival [[Natural history|naturalist]] to [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]]. Menzies first documented the tree on [[Vancouver Island]] in 1791. Colloquially, the species is also known simply as '''Doug-fir''' or as '''Douglas pine''' (although the latter common name may also refer to ''[[Pinus douglasiana]]'').\n\nOne [[Coast Salish]] name for the tree, used in the [[Halkomelem]] language, is ''l\u00e1:yelhp''.<ref>Dictionary of Upriver Halkomelem, Volume I, pp. 213. Galloway, Brent Douglas.</ref>\n\n==Description==\nDouglas firs are medium-size to extremely large [[evergreen]] [[tree]]s, {{convert|20|-|100|m|-1}} tall (although only coast Douglas firs reach such great height).<ref>{{cite book|title=Forest Giants of the World Past and Present|first=Al|last=Carder|year=1995|pages=3\u20134}}</ref> The [[leaf|leaves]] are flat, soft, linear, {{convert|2|-|4|cm|in|1}} long, generally resembling those of the firs, occurring singly rather than in [[fascicle (botany)|fascicle]]s; they completely encircle the branches, which can be useful in recognizing the species. As the trees grow taller in denser forest, they lose their lower branches, such that the foliage may start high off the ground. Douglas firs in environments with more light may have branches much closer to the ground.\n\nThe female [[Conifer cone|cones]] are pendulous, with persistent scales unlike true firs. They are distinctive in having a long tridentine (three-pointed) [[bract]] that protrudes prominently above each scale (it resembles the back half of a mouse, with two feet and a tail).\n\n== Distribution ==\nOne [[Variety (botany)|variety]], [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|coast Douglas fir]] (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var. ''menziesii''), grows in the coastal regions, from west-central [[British Columbia]] southward to central [[California]]. In [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], its range is continuous from the eastern edge of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] west to the [[Pacific Coast Ranges]] and Pacific Ocean. In California, it is found in the [[Klamath Mountains|Klamath]] and [[California Coast Ranges]] as far south as the [[Santa Lucia Range]], with a small stand as far south as the [[Purisima Hills]] in Santa Barbara County.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A New Douglas-Fir Locality in Southern California |author=James R.

It occurs from near sea level along the coast to {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level in the mountains of California.\n\nFurther inland, coast Douglas fir is replaced by another variety, [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca|Rocky Mountain or interior Douglas fir]] (''P.&nbsp;menziesii'' var. ''glauca''). Interior Douglas fir intergrades with coast Douglas fir in the Cascades of northern Washington and southern British Columbia, and from there ranges northward to central British Columbia and southeastward to the Mexican border, becoming increasingly disjunct as latitude decreases and altitude increases.  [[Pseudotsuga lindleyana|Mexican Douglas fir]] (''P.&nbsp;lindleyana''), which ranges as far south as [[Oaxaca]], is often considered a variety of ''P. menziesii''.\n\n== Ecology ==\nDouglas-fir prefers acidic or neutral soils.<ref>https://www.arborday.org/trees/treeguide/treedetail.cfm?itemID=836</ref>  However, Douglas fir exhibits considerable morphological plasticity, and on drier sites coast Douglas fir will generate deeper taproots.  Interior Douglas fir exhibits even greater plasticity, occurring in stands of interior temperate rainforest in British Columbia, as well as at the edge of semi-arid sagebrush steppe throughout much of its range, where it generates even deeper taproots than coast Douglas fir is capable.\n[[File:Pseudotsuga menziesii 01221.JPG|left|thumb|upright|A [[snag (ecology)|snag]] provides nest cavities for birds]]\n\nMature or \"old-growth\" Douglas fir forest is the primary habitat of the [[red tree vole]] (''Arborimus longicaudus'') and the [[spotted owl]] (''Strix occidentalis''). Home range requirements for breeding pairs of spotted owls are at least 400&nbsp;ha ({{convert|4|km2|acre|disp=comma}}) of old-growth. Red tree voles may also be found in immature forests if Douglas fir is a significant component. This animal nests almost exclusively in the foliage of Douglas fir trees. Nests are located {{convert|2|-|50|m|ft|round=5}} above the ground. The red vole's diet consists chiefly of Douglas fir needles. A [[parasitic plant]] sometimes utilizing ''P. menziesii'' is [[Douglas-fir dwarf mistletoe]] (''Arceuthobium douglasii'').\n\nThe leaves are also used by the [[Adelgidae|woolly conifer aphid]] ''[[Adelges cooleyi]]''; this 0.5&nbsp;mm long [[Sap (plant)|sap]]-sucking [[insect]] is conspicuous on the undersides of the leaves by the small white \"fluff spots\" of protective wax that it produces. It is often present in large numbers, and can cause the foliage to turn yellowish from the damage in causes. Exceptionally, trees may be partially defoliated by it, but the damage is rarely this severe. Among [[Lepidoptera]], apart from some that feed on ''[[Pseudotsuga]]'' in general (see there) the [[gelechiid moth]]s ''Chionodes abella'' and ''C. periculella'' as well as the cone scale-eating [[tortrix moth]] ''[[Cydia illutana]]'' have been recorded specifically on ''P. menziesii''.\n\n[[File:Pseudotsuga menziesii 7971.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Mature individual in the [[Wenatchee Mountains]]]]\n\nThe coast Douglas fir variety is the dominant tree west of the Cascade Mountains in the [[Pacific Northwest]], occurring in nearly all forest types, competes well on most parent materials, aspects, and slopes. Adapted to a moist, mild climate, it grows larger and faster than [[Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir|Rocky Mountain Douglas fir]]. Associated trees include [[western hemlock]], [[Sitka spruce]], [[sugar pine]], [[western white pine]], [[ponderosa pine]], [[grand fir]], [[coast redwood]], [[western redcedar]], [[incense-cedar|California incense-cedar]], [[Chamaecyparis lawsoniana|Lawson's cypress]], [[tanoak]], [[bigleaf maple]] and several others. Pure stands are also common, particularly north of the [[Umpqua River]] in Oregon.\n\n[[Poriol]] is a flavanone, a type of flavonoid, produced by ''P. menziesii'' in reaction to infection by ''[[Poria weirii]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Barton | first1 = G.M. | year = 1972 | title = New C-methylflavanones from Douglas fir | url = | journal = Phytochemistry | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 426\u2013429 | doi = 10.1016/S0031-9422(00)90036-0 }}</ref>\n\n== Forest succession ==\nThe shade-intolerance of Douglas fir plays a large role in the forest [[Ecological succession|succession]] of lowland old growth rainforest communities of the Pacific Northwest. While mature stands of lowland old-growth rainforest contain many [[western hemlock]] (''Tsuga heterophylla'') seedlings, and some [[western redcedar]] (''Thuja plicata'') seedlings, Douglas fir dominated stands contain almost no Douglas fir seedlings. This seeming contradiction occurs because Douglas firs are intolerant of deep shade and rarely survive for long within the shaded understory.  When a tree dies in a mature [[forest]] the canopy opens up and sunlight becomes available as a source of energy for new growth. The shade-tolerant western hemlock seedlings that sprout beneath the canopy have a head-start on other seedlings. This competitive advantage allows the western hemlock to grow rapidly into the sunlight, while other [[seedling]]s still struggle to emerge from the soil. The boughs of the growing western hemlock limit the sunlight for smaller trees and severely limit the chances of shade-intolerant trees, such as the Douglas fir. Over the course of centuries, western hemlock typically come to dominate the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] of an old-growth lowland rainforest.\n\nDouglas firs are [[seral]] trees in [[temperate rainforest]], and possess thicker bark and a somewhat faster growth rate than most other climax trees of the area, such as the western hemlock and western redcedar. This quality often gives Douglas firs a competitive advantage when the forest experiences a major disturbance such as fire. Periodically, portions of a Pacific Northwest lowland forest may be burned by wildfire, may be logged, or may be blown down by a wind storm. These types of disturbances allow Douglas fir to regenerate in openings, and low-intensity fires often leave Douglas fir trees standing on drier sites, while less drought- and fire-tolerant species are unable to get established.\n\n[[File:Red Creek Fir.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Red Creek fir]], about {{convert|15|km|mi}} from [[Port Renfrew]], in [[British Columbia]], measures {{convert|43.7|ft|m}} around its base and stretches {{convert|242|ft|m}} high]]\n\nConifers dominate the climax forests of the coast Douglas fir. All of the climax conifers that grow alongside it can live for centuries, with a few species capable of living for over a millennium. Forests that exist on this time scale experience the type of sporadic disturbances that allow mature stands of Douglas fir to establish themselves as a persistent element within a mature old-growth forest. When [[old growth forests]] survive in a natural state, they often look like a patchwork quilt of different forest communities. Western hemlock typically dominate oldgrowth rainforests, but contain sections of Douglas firs, redcedar, [[alder]], and even [[coast redwood]] forests on their southern extent, near the Oregon and California border, while [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]] increases in frequency with latitude.\n\nThe logging practices of the last 200 years created artificial disturbances that caused Douglas firs to thrive. The Douglas fir's useful wood and its quick growth make it the crop of choice for many timber companies, which typically replant a clear-cut area with Douglas fir seedlings. The high-light conditions that exist within a clear-cut also naturally favor the regeneration of Douglas fir. Because of clear-cut logging, almost all the Pacific Northwest forests not strictly set aside for protection are today dominated by Douglas fir, while the normally dominant climax species, such as western hemlock and western redcedar are less common. On drier sites in California, where Douglas fir behaves as a climax species in the absence of fire, the Douglas fir has become somewhat invasive following fire suppression practices of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries; it is becoming a dominant species in many [[oak]] [[California oak woodland|woodlands]], in which it was previously a minor component.<ref>C.

It is native to the [[southwestern United States]] and northern [[Mexico]], where it grows in a number of habitats including [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|desert scrub]] and [[chaparral]]. It is unusual in the genus in that some (though not all) specimens have simple leaves instead of the pinnate leaves more characteristic of the group.\n\n==Description==\n''Fraxinus anomala'' is a deciduous [[shrub]] or small tree approaching maximum heights of five to six meters. The leaf may be simple or it may be compound, composed of up to five leaflets which look like individual leaves. Each leaflet is oval-shaped to round and may have teeth along the edges. The nondescript brownish flowers lack petals. The fruit is a flat [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] up to two centimeters long and one wide, green when young and tan to brown when mature. The samaras hang in bunches.\n\n==Distribution==\nIn [[Arizona]], singleleaf ash is found along the [[Arizona transition zone]] of the [[Mogollon Rim]]. In northern Arizona's [[Grand Canyon]], the range extends down the main canyons from southern and southeastern [[Utah]], its major range area, where the [[Canyon Lands]] also show the range entering upper reaches of river basins flowing from western [[Colorado]] &ndash; [[Colorado River|Colorado]] and [[Dolores River]]s; also the shorter [[Yellowjacket River|Yellowjacket]] and [[McElmo River]]s in Colorado's extreme southwest.<ref>Little.

It is a high-altitude species; in the north of its range, it grows widely at {{convert|1500|to|2100|m|abbr=on}} altitude, and at {{convert|1800|to|2900|m|abbr=on}} in the south of its range.<ref name=\"silvics\">{{Silvics |first=James L. |last=Jenkinson |volume=1 |genus=Pinus |species=jeffreyi}}</ref>\n\nJeffrey pine is tolerant of [[serpentine soil]]s and is often dominant in these conditions, even on dry sites at fairly low altitudes.<ref name=\"silvics\"/> On other soils, it only becomes dominant at higher altitudes where the usually faster-growing ponderosa pine (''[[Pinus ponderosa]]'') does not thrive. Jeffrey pine is more stress tolerant than the closely related [[Ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus ponderosa''). At higher elevations, on poorer soils, in colder climates, and in dryer climates, Jeffrey pine replaces ponderosa as the dominant tree.<ref name=NRVYP/>\n\n[[File:Jeffrey pine Siskiyou Wilderness.jpg|thumb|left|x160px|Jeffrey pine, ''Pinus jeffreyi'', in the [[Siskiyou Mountains]] of northwest California, growing on [[serpentine group|serpentine]]]]\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Description==\nJeffrey pine is a large [[pinophyta|coniferous]] [[evergreen]] tree, reaching {{convert|25|to|40|m|abbr=on}} tall, rarely up to {{convert|53|m|abbr=on}} tall, though smaller when growing at or near [[tree line]].<ref name=\"silvics\"/> The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, in bundles of three, stout, [[glaucous]] gray-green, {{convert|12|to|23|cm|abbr=on}} long. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are {{convert|12|to|24|cm|abbr=on}} long, dark purple when immature, ripening pale brown, with thinly woody scales bearing a short, sharp inward-pointing barb. The seeds are {{convert|10|to|12|mm|abbr=on}} long, with a large ({{convert|15|to|25|mm|abbr=on}}) wing.\n\nThe Jeffrey pine is closely related to the ponderosa pine and is similar in appearance. One way to distinguish between them is by their cones. Each has barbs at the end of the scales. The sharp Jeffrey pine cone scale barbs point inward, so the cone feels smooth to the palm of one's hand when rubbed down the cone. Ponderosa pine cone scale barbs point outward, so feel sharp and prickly to the palm of one's hands. This gives rise to the memory device for distinguishing between them - \"gentle Jeffrey and prickly ponderosa\". Another distinguishing characteristic is that the needles of Jeffrey pine are glaucous, less bright green than those of ponderosa pine, and by the stouter, heavier cones with larger seeds and inward-pointing barbs.<ref name=\"Moore2008\">{{cite book |last1=Moore|first1=Gerry |last2=Kershner|first2=Bruce |first3=Craig|last3=Tufts |first4=Daniel|last4=Mathews |first5=Gil|last5=Nelson |last6=Spellenberg|first6=Richard |last7=Thieret|first7=John W. |first8=Terry|last8=Purinton |last9=Block|first9=Andrew|display-authors=4 |title=National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Trees of North America |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |year=2008 |page=86 |isbn=1-4027-3875-7}}</ref> Jeffrey pine is also very distinct from ponderosa pine in its [[resin]] scent, variously described as reminiscent of vanilla, lemon, pineapple, violets, apple,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enature.com/flashcard/show_flash_card.asp?recordNumber=TS0040|title=Jeffrey Pine|work=enature.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614142314/http://www.enature.com/flashcard/show_flash_card.asp?recordNumber=TS0040|archivedate=2011-06-14}}</ref> and, quite commonly, butterscotch;<ref>{{cite book|title=Wild Plants of the Sierra Nevada|first1=Ray S.|last1=Vizgirdas|first2=Edna M.|last2=Rey-Vizgirdas|year=2006|publisher=University of Nevada Press|location=Reno, Nevada}}</ref> compared to the turpentine or odorless scent of ponderosa pine {{citation needed|reason=Ponderosa pines are also found to have similar smells to Jeffrey Pines (http://www.npr.org/2009/08/17/111803772/ponderosa-pines-rugged-trees-with-a-sweet-smell)|date=October 2014}}. This may be tested by breaking off a shoot or some needles, or by simply smelling the resin's scent in between the plates of the bark. This difference in scent is related to the very unusual composition of the resin, with the [[volatile organic compound|volatile]] component made up almost entirely of pure [[heptane|n-heptane]]. Jeffrey pine can be somewhat distinguished from ponderosa pine by the relatively smaller scales of bark as compared to the larger plates of more reddish-colored ponderosa bark.\n\n==Uses==\nJeffrey pine wood is similar to ponderosa pine wood, and is used for the same purposes. The exceptional purity of n-heptane distilled from Jeffrey pine resin led to n-heptane being selected as the zero point on the [[Petrol#Octane rating|octane rating]] scale of [[petrol]].\n\nAs it mainly consists of n-heptane, Jeffrey pine resin is a poor source of [[turpentine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plants.usda.gov/plantguide/pdf/pg_pije.pdf|title=Jeffrey Pine|work=NRCS Plant Guide|publisher=USDA}}</ref>  Before Jeffrey pine was distinguished from ponderosa pine as a distinct species in 1853, resin distillers operating in its range suffered a number of 'inexplicable' explosions during distillation, now known to have been caused by the unwitting use of Jeffrey pine resin.\n\n==Cultivation==\nJeffrey pine has ornamental value and can be found in parks and gardens throughout the [[Temperate climate|temperate]] world.

It grows as part of mixed woodlands, and also on slopes and in valleys wherever conditions are favorable. It is threatened by development and overgrazing.  Some native stands remain in urban [[Los Angeles]] in the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] and [[Hollywood Hills]].  ''J. californica''  grows in [[riparian]] woodlands, either in single species stands or mixed with [[California oak woodland|California's oaks]] (''[[Quercus]]'' spp.) and cottonwoods (''[[Populus fremontii]]'').\n\n==Description==\n''Juglans californica'' can be either a large shrub with 1-5 trunks, or a small, single-trunked tree.  The main trunk can fork close to the ground, making it look like two trees that have grown together, then diverged.  It has thick bark, deeply channeled or furrowed at maturity.  It has large, [[pinnate]]ly compound leaves with 11-19 [[lanceolate]] leaflets with toothed margins and no hair in the vein angles.<ref>Kershner, Mathews, Nelson, and Spellenberg, ''National Wildlife Federation field Guide to Trees of North America'', 2008, Chanticleer Press, Inc. p. 229</ref> It has a small hard nut in a shallowly grooved, thick shell that is difficult to remove.\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Food===\nThe [[Chumash (tribe)|Chumash Indians]] of the [[Channel Islands of California]] and [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]] eat the nuts;{{cn|date=January 2017}} however, they are not grown commercially for this purpose.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Cultivation===\n''J. californica'' is cultivated throughout California to support the walnut industry, used as a rootstock in English walnut orchards. It is also cultivated as an ornamental tree where it is planted in [[California native plants|California native plant]], [[Xeriscaping|xeriscape]], and [[Backyard Wildlife Habitat|wildlife habitat]] gardens and [[natural landscaping]] in California, and in Hawaii.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nSome authorities (e.g. the [[California Native Plant Society]]) combine this species with ''J. hindsii''.  On the other hand, a 2007 molecular analysis of the genus<ref>Aradhya, M. K, D. Potter, F. Gao, & C. J.

In California it is found in: the [[Peninsular Ranges]], [[Transverse Ranges]], [[California Coast Ranges]], [[Sacramento Valley]] foothills, [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and at higher elevation [[sky island]]s in the [[Mojave Desert]] ranges.\n\nIt grows at moderate altitudes of {{convert|750|-|1600|m|ft}}. Habitats include: [[Pinyon-juniper woodland|Pinyon-Juniper Woodland]] with [[Pinus monophylla|Single-leaf pinyon (''Pinus monophylla'')]]; [[Joshua tree|Joshua Tree]] Woodland; and [[Foothill Woodland]]s, in the [[California montane chaparral and woodlands|Montane chaparral and woodlands]] and [[California interior chaparral and woodlands|Interior chaparral and woodlands]] sub-ecoregions.\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Juniperus californica 00090.JPG|thumb|left|Branches and fruit]]\n''Juniperus californica'' is a [[shrub]] or small [[tree]] reaching {{convert|3|-|8|m|ft}}, but rarely up to {{convert|10|m|ft}} tall. The bark is ashy gray, typically thin, and appears to be \"shredded\".<ref name=\"ladybird\">[http://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=JUCA7 University of Texas at Austin, Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center: ''Juniperus californica'']</ref>  The shoots are fairly thick compared to most [[juniper]]s, between {{convert|1.5|and|2|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter.\n\nFoliage is bluish-gray and scale-like. The [[leaf|leaves]] are arranged in [[opposite leaves|opposite]] decussate pairs or whorls of three; the adult leaves are scale-like, {{convert|1|to|5|mm|in|abbr=on}} long on lead shoots and {{convert|1|to|1.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} broad. The juvenile leaves (on seedlings only) are needle-like, {{convert|5|to|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|cones]] are berry-like, {{convert|7|to|13|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, blue-brown with a whitish waxy bloom, turning reddish-brown, and contain a single [[seed]] (rarely two or three).<ref name=\"ladybird\"/> The seeds are mature in about 8\u20139 months. The male cones are {{convert|2|to|4|mm|in|abbr=on}} long, and shed their pollen in early spring. It is largely [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], producing cones of only one sex, but around 2% of plants are [[plant sexuality|monoecious]], with both sexes on the same plant.<ref>Charters (2007)</ref>\n\nIt is closely related to [[Juniperus osteosperma|''Juniperus osteosperma'' (Utah Juniper)]] from further east, which shares the stout shoots and relatively large cones, but differs in that Utah Juniper is largely monoecious, its cones take longer to mature (two growing seasons), and it's also markedly more cold-tolerant.\n\n==Uses==\n''Juniperus californica'' provides food and shelter for a variety of native ground and avian wildlife. It is a larval host for the native moth [[Sphinx sequoiae|Sequoia sphinx (''Sphinx sequoiae'')]].<ref name=\"ladybird\"/>\n\n===Native Americans===\nThe plant was used as a traditional Native American [[medicinal plant]], and as a food source, by the [[indigenous peoples of California]], including the [[Cahuilla people]], [[Kumeyaay people]] (''Diegueno''), and [[Ohlone people]].<ref>[http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Juniperus+californica University of Michigan, Dearborn; Ethnobotany of ''Juniperus californica'']</ref> They gathered the berries to eat fresh and to grind into meal for baking.<ref name=\"ladybird\"/>\n\n===Cultivation===\n''Juniperus californica'' is cultivated as an [[ornamental plant]], as a dense shrub (and eventual tree) for use in [[habitat garden]]s, heat and [[xeriscape|drought-tolerant]] gardens, and in [[natural landscaping]] design.<ref name=\"ladybird\"/>  It is very tolerant of alkali soils, and can provide erosion control on dry slopes. California Juniper is also a popular species for [[bonsai]].<ref>[http://www.laspilitas.com/nature-of-california/plants/juniperus-californica Las Pilitas Horticultural Database: ''Juniperus californica'' (California Juniper)]</ref>\n\n;Conservation\nAn IUCN  [[Least concern]] listed species, and not considered globally threatened currently. However, one of the southernmost populations, formerly on [[Guadalupe Island]] off the [[Baja California Peninsula]] coast, was destroyed by [[feral]] [[goat]]s in the late 19th century.<ref>Le\u00f3n de la Luz ''et al.''

It reaches heights of {{convert|8|-|24|m|ft}}.<ref>Gymnosperm Database, 2008</ref> However, it can be a shrub on especially poor sites.  It prefers dry rocky mountain soils. The bark is smooth, flaky and gray-brown when young, becoming dark gray-red-brown and shallowly furrowed into flat scaly ridges.  The twigs are red-brown and often resinous.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are in fascicles of three,<ref>eNature Field Guides, 2007</ref> needle-like, yellow-green, twisted, and 9\u201315&nbsp;cm (about 3.5\u20136 in) long.  The [[Conifer cone|cone]]s are 8\u201316&nbsp;cm long and clustered in whorls of three to six on the branches.  The scales end in a short stout prickle.  The cones remain closed for many years until a fire opens them and allows reseeding.  As a result, the cones may even become embedded in the trunk as the tree grows.\n\n==Ecology==\n{{Further information|Fire ecology}}\nThe knobcone pine (''Pinus attenuata'') forms nearly pure stands, however it may [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridize]] with [[Bishop pine|bishop pine (''Pinus muricata'')]], and [[Pinus radiata|Monterey pine (''Pinus radiata'')]] on the coast.\n\nIn the western foothills of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], knobcone pine is often a co-dominant with  [[Quercus douglasii|blue oak (''Quercus douglasii'')]].<ref>C.

Lithocarpus) densiflorus'' [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, {{convert|7|-|15|cm|in|abbr=on}}, with toothed margins and a hard, leathery texture, and persist for three to four years. At first they are covered in dense orange-brown scurfy hairs on both sides, but those on the upper surface soon wear off, those on the under surface persisting longer but eventually wearing off too.\n\nThe [[seed]] is a [[acorn]] {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and 2&nbsp;cm in diameter, very similar to an [[oak]] [[acorn]], but with a very hard, woody nut shell more like a [[hazel]] nut. The nut sits in a cup during its 18-month maturation; the outside surface of the cup is rough with short spines. The nuts are produced in clusters of a few together on a single stem. The nut kernel is very bitter, and is inedible for people without extensive leaching, although [[squirrel]]s eat them.\n\nTanoak is one of the species most seriously affected by \"sudden oak death\" (''[[Phytophthora ramorum]]''), with high mortality reported over much of the species' range.<ref>http://cisr.ucr.edu/sudden_oak_death.html Sudden Oak Death at University of California, Riverside, Center for Invasive Species Research</ref>\n\n===''Notholithocarpus densiflorus'' var. ''echinoides''===\nMembers of populations in interior California (in the northern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]) and the [[Klamath Mountains]] into southwest Oregon are smaller, rarely exceeding {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height and often shrubby, with smaller leaves, {{convert|4|-|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; these are separated as \"dwarf tanoak\", ''Notholithocarpus densiflorus'' var. ''echinoides''. The variety intergrades with the type in northwest California and southwest Oregon. Tanoak does grow on [[serpentine soil]]s as a shrub.\n\n==Uses==\n\nSome California [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] prefer this nut to those of many ''[[Quercus]]'' [[acorn]]s because it stores well due to the comparatively high tannin content. The [[Maidu#Local divisions|Concow tribe]] call the nut '''h\u00e4\u2019-h\u00e4''' ([[Konkow language]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chesnut | first1 =Victor King |title=Plants used by the Indians of Mendocino County, California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLkUAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=24 August 2012|year=1902|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office|Government Printing Office]]|page = 405}}</ref> The [[Hupa]] people use the acorns to make meal, from which they would make mush, bread, biscuits, pancakes, and cakes.

It is the only species in the [[Monotypic taxon|monotypic genus]] '''''Olneya'''''. This tree is part of the western [[Sonoran Desert]] complex in the [[Southwestern United States]], which includes flora such as [[Parkinsonia|palo verde]], [[saguaro]], [[ocotillo]], [[brittlebush]], [[creosote bush]], and [[mesquite]].\n\n==Description==\nThe desert ironwood grows as a [[shrub|bush]] or [[tree]] and reaches heights of about {{convert|10|m|ft|0}}, and average trunk diameters of about {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}}; in exceptional sites in larger protected washes, greater height and more massive.\n\nIn younger trees, the bark is gray, shiny, and smooth; in older trees the bark is broken open. The tree is an [[evergreen|evergreen plant]], but can lose its leaves if temperatures fall below {{convert|2|C|F|abbr=on}}. In continual drought conditions leaves will be lost.\n\nLeaves are bluish-green and pinnately compound. Leaves are arranged on a petiole, {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} long, with 6-9 leaflets-(or variously up to 15, 7, 7-opposite, and one terminal), each being {{convert|0.7|to|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. At the base of each pinnate leaf petiole grow two thorns, about {{convert|1|cm|in|abbr=on}} long.\n\nBloom time occurs in late April/May to June. Flowers are of 5 unequal petals, in colors of medium purple, magenta-red, or also white to pale pink. Seedpods are 5\u20138&nbsp;cm (2\u20134&nbsp;in) long, and light reddish brown. When seedpods are ripened two other species ''[[Parkinsonia florida]]''-([[Blue Palo Verde]]), and ''[[Acacia constricta]]''-(Catclaw Acacia) have similar light red brownish colors. Catclaw acacia seedpods are noticeably ''J-shaped'' and of shorter length.\n\n==Range and location==\nThe desert ironwood, ''Olneya'', is native to the [[southwestern United States]] and extreme [[northwestern Mexico]] in the [[Baja California Peninsula]] and the [[Sonoran Desert]], and is partially an [[indicator species]] of that desert. Within Mexico its range includes the states of [[Baja California Sur]] and [[Baja California]], on the [[Gulf of California]] side east of the cordillera ranges, and [[Sonora]] state west of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] cordillera, in the south approaching the northern border of northern [[Sinaloa]] state. In the southwestern US its range includes the [[Colorado Desert]] of southeast [[Southern California]], a part of the Sonoran Desert, and western and southern [[Arizona]]. ''Olneya'' does not range into the higher-elevation, colder, southeast of Arizona's Sonoran Desert region, nor into the [[sky island]]s of the [[Madrean Sky Islands]] region.\n\n[[Ironwood Forest National Monument]] in south-central Arizona is named for ''Olneya tesota''.\n\n===An indicator species===\n[[File:Olneya-tesota-01.jpg|thumb|220x220px|''Olneya tesota'', the ironwood tree<br />(the mature, smooth white-gray tree trunk & branches are visible)]]\n''Olneya tesota'' is an [[indicator species]] of the [[Sonoran Desert]] region.<ref>''Atlas of United States Trees, Volume 3, Minor Western Hardwoods'', Map 103-''Olneya tesota''</ref> The Sonoran Desert has one other species with the identical north-south, and east-west range. The seasonally migrating [[Lesser Long-nosed Bat]] follows the bloom season of various species from south to north and extends into the same regions of the Sonoran Desert as Olneya; (their ranging maps are virtually identical). The bat ranges from southern Baja California del Sur and north into the southwestern United States.<ref>[http://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/spring/Bats_LeptoRangeMap.html Bat range, and article]</ref>\n\nIn the north, both species define the Colorado Desert subregion of the Sonoran Desert surrounding the northern end of the [[Gulf of California]]; further south in the [[Baja Peninsula]] the sub-division is defined as the Vizcaino Desert.\n\nThe winter and permanent range of the bat extend into the northern countries of [[Central America]].\n\n==Use and workability==\nOlneya ironwood is very hard and heavy. Its density is greater than water and thus sinks; it does not float downstream in washes, and must be moved by current motion. One popular usage for the wood is for [[knife]] handles, since its hardness, grain, and coloring is ideal.\n\nDue to its considerable hardness, processing desert ironwood is difficult.

Common names include '''palo verde''', '''Mexican palo verde''', '''Parkinsonia''', '''Jerusalem thorn''', and '''jelly bean tree'''.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe genus name ''Parkinsonia'' honors the English botanist [[John Parkinson (botanist)|John Parkinson]] (1567\u20131650), while the species Latin name ''aculeata'' refers to the thorny stem of this plant.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Parkinsonia aculeata 4.jpg|thumb|220px|Close-up on flowers of ''Parkinsonia aculeata'']] ''Parkinsonia aculeata'' may be a spiny shrub or a small tree. It grows {{convert|2|to|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, with a maximum height of {{convert|10|m}}. Palo verde may have single or multiple stems and many branches with pendulous leaves. The [[leaf|leaves]] and stems are [[trichome|hairless]]. The leaves are alternate and pennate (15 to 20&nbsp;cm long). The flattened [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] is edged by two rows of 25\u201330 tiny oval leaflets; the leaflets are soon [[deciduous]] in dry weather (and during the winter in some areas) leaving the green petioles and branches to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]].\n\nThe branches grow double or triple sharp [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spines]] {{convert|7|-|12|mm|in|abbr=on}} long at the axils of the leaves. The [[flower]]s are yellow- orange and fragrant, {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, growing from a long slender stalk in groups of eight to ten. They have  five sepals and five petals, four of them clearer and rhomboid ovate, the fifth elongated, with a warmer yellow and purple spots at the base. The flowering period is the middle months of  spring(March& April or September & October). The flowers are pollinated by bees. The [[fruit]] is a [[legume|seedpod]], leathery in appearance, light brown when mature.\n\n==Invasive problems==\n''P. aculeata'' is a major [[invasive species]] in [[Australia]], parts of tropical [[Africa]], [[Hawaii]], and other [[Pacific islands|Islands]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]].\n\nIt was introduced to Australia as an [[ornamental tree]] and for shade around 1900. It is now a serious [[Invasive species in Australia|weed]] widespread through [[Western Australia]], the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Queensland]], covering about {{convert|8000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land, and has the potential to spread through most of the [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] to subhumid tropical area in Australia.\n\nIt forms dense [[thicket]]s, preventing access for humans, native animals and [[livestock]] to waterways. The fruits (seedpods) float, and the plant spreads by dropping pods into water, or pods are washed downstream by seasonal [[flood]]ing.  Without the scarifying received by tumbling in streambeds, the seeds are slow to germinate.\n\nSeveral control methods are used to reduce the existing population and the spread of ''P. aculeata'' in Australia. Three [[insect]]s have been [[Introduced species|introduced]] to Australia for [[biological control]]; the parkinsonia [[bean weevil]]s, ''Penthobruchus germaini'' and ''Mimosestes ulkei'', both have [[larva]]e that specifically eat the seeds from parkinsonia pods and are proving to be a useful management tool, and the parkinsonia leaf bug, ''Rhinacloa callicrates'', which destroys [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] tissues but has had little overall impact on the plant. Fire is effective for young trees; mechanical removal and [[herbicide]]s are also used.\n\n==Distribution==\n''P. aculeata'' is native to the Sonoran and Chihuahan Deserts of [[southwestern United States]] (western [[Texas]], southern [[New Mexico]] southern [[Arizona]]), and northern [[Mexico]] ([[Sonora]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]) as well as the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]]. Its native range has expanded over the last several decades into the ([[Edwards Plateau]] and [[Central Texas]]).  It has been moved by humans into the [[Caribbean]], [[South America]] south to northern [[Argentina]], and Hawai'i.  It has been introduced in [[Europe]] and it is widespread in [[Australia]].<ref name=\"GRIN\"/>  This thin barked species does not become established in areas where weather dips below 20 degrees F.  It has expanded into Southern California as far north as San Bernardino County.\n\n==Habitat==\n''Parkinsonia aculeata'' has a high tolerance to drought, simply attaining shorter stature. In moist and humus-rich environments it becomes a taller, spreading shade tree.  This plant prefers a full sun exposure, but can grow on a wide range of dry soils (sand dunes, clay, alkaline and chalky soils,etc.), at an altitude of {{convert|0|-|1500|m}} above sea level.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n\nFile:Caesalpiniaceae - Parkinsonia aculeata-4.JPG|Shrub of ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\nFile:Caesalpiniaceae - Parkinsonia aculeata-1.JPG|Leaflets of ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\nFile:Caesalpiniaceae - Parkinsonia aculeata-2.JPG|Leaflets of ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\nFile:Caesalpiniaceae - Parkinsonia aculeata-3.JPG|Thorns on ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\nFile:Parkinsonia aculeata 3.jpg|Plant of ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\nFile:Parkinsonia aculeata flowers 3.jpg|Flowers of ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*Cooperative Centre for Weed Management.

The plant is mostly found on slopes, and is one of the most common trees of the [[Sonoran Desert]].\n\n== Description ==\n''Parkinsonia microphylla'' is a bristling, upright-branching [[tree]]. The species is slow-growing, sometimes living for several hundred years. It typically grows to heights of around {{convert|5|m|ft}}, although rarely it can reach {{convert|6|-|7|m|ft}} tall.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are yellowish green, and during extensively dry and hot periods the tree will shed them.  It has the characteristic of performing [[photosynthesis]] in its bark (hence the green color), and this is what allows it to survive leafless in hotter periods.\n\nThe flowers are found on the end of a branch, small, pale yellow and occur in late spring. The tree may not flower every year, depending on the amount rainfall. If there is enough rainfall, seeds will also appear in 4\u20138&nbsp;cm long, soft pods which dip in between each seed. They ripen in July, and stick to the branches. Rodents will often carry and store the seeds underground, where some of them will [[germinate]] after a rainy season.\n\nThe seedlings are very sensitive to drought for the first two to three months of their lives, and only about 1.6% will survive after germinating.\n;Threats\n[[Buffelgrass]] is an exotic species of grass native to [[Africa]], first introduced into the Sonoran Desert for livestock grazing, which spreads very quickly and can often kill seedlings by using available water, which could be a threat in the future.\n\n== Uses ==\nThe [[Seri people|Seri]] people, a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] group of northwestern Mexico, call this tree ''ziipx\u00f6l'' {{IPA-sei|\u0283i\u02d0p\u03c7\u02b7\u026c|}}. They used to grind up the seeds for flour, boil the green pods with meat, and eat the sweet green seeds as well as the flowers. They also strung the seeds for necklaces.\n\n=== Cultivation ===\n''Parkinsonia microphylla'' is cultivated as an [[ornamental tree]] for use in [[xeriscapic]], modernist, and [[native plant]] gardens. It is also used as a small tree in parking lot plantings of commercial developments.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:foothillpaloverde1346.JPG|Foothill Palo Verde pictured near the Superstition Mountains (Arizona)\nFile:Parkinsonia microphylla 2.jpg|Flowers\nFile:Saguaro forest 2, Ironwood NM.JPG|[[Saguaro]] and Palo Verde forest, [[Ironwood Forest  National Monument]]\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n* {{GRIN|100141|Parkinsonia microphylla}}\n*{{cite book |last=Felger |first=Richard |author2=Mary B.

The crown is broad conic in young trees, becoming cylindric in older trees; old trees may not have branches lower than {{convert|30|\u2013|40|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The shoots are very pale buff-brown, almost white, and glabrous (hairless), but with prominent [[pulvini]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] are stiff, sharp, and needle-like, 15\u201325&nbsp;mm long, flattened in cross-section, dark glaucous blue-green above with two or three thin lines of [[stomata]], and blue-white below with two dense bands of stomata.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|cones]] are pendulous, slender cylindrical, {{convert|6|\u2013|10|cm|abbr=on}} long <ref>{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/dept/ldplants/pisi.htm|title=Picea sitchensis |publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=April 9, 2012}}</ref> and 2&nbsp;cm broad when closed, opening to 3&nbsp;cm broad. They have thin, flexible scales 15\u201320&nbsp;mm long; the bracts just above the scales are the longest of any spruce, occasionally just exserted and visible on the closed cones.

It is a [[tree]] growing to 25\u201335 m tall, with a trunk diameter of up {{convert|1.2|m|0|abbr=on}}. The needles are in bundles of 3, 4, or 5, with 5-needle fascicles being the most prevalent. This variability may be a sign of hybridization with the closely related [[ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus ponderosa''). The cones are single, paired, or in whorls of three, and 5\u201311&nbsp;cm long.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe Arizona pine had been thought to be a variant of Ponderosa pine by some botanists, but is now recognized as a distinct species by most authorities.\n\nTwo varieties are described, possibly better treated as distinct species; see [[Ponderosa pine]] for a table of characters:\n*''Pinus arizonica'' var. ''arizonica'', in the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] from [[Arizona]] south to [[Durango (state)|Durango]]\n*''Pinus arizonica'' var ''stormiae'', in the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] from the [[Big Bend National Park]] in Texas south to [[San Luis Potos\u00ed (state)|San Luis Potos\u00ed]].\n\nAnother related pine, [[Cooper's pine]] (''Pinus cooperi'') is also treated as a variety of Arizona pine by some authors, as ''Pinus arizonica'' var.

Isolated groves are found as far north as the San Francisco Bay Area in [[Mt. Diablo State Park]] and [[Black Diamond Mines Regional Preserve]]. The species is named after [[Thomas Coulter]], an Irish [[botanist]] and physician.\n\nThe Coulter pine produces the heaviest cone of any pine tree. Although it has a limited range in the wild, it is a popular ornamental tree.\n\n==Description==\n''Pinus coulteri'' is a substantial [[pinophyta|coniferous]] [[evergreen]] [[tree]] in the [[genus]] ''[[Pinus]]''. The size ranges from {{convert|10|\u2013|24|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall,<ref>Gymnosperm Database, 2008</ref> and a trunk diameter up to {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The trunk is vertical and branches horizontal to upcurved. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, in bundles of three, glaucous gray-green, {{convert|15|\u2013|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and stout, {{convert|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick.\n\nThe outstanding characteristic of this tree is the large, spiny [[conifer cone|cones]] which are {{convert|20|\u2013|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, and weigh {{convert|2|\u2013|5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} when fresh. Coulter pines produce the largest cones of any pine tree species (people are actually advised to wear hardhats when working in Coulter pine groves), although the slender cones of the [[sugar pine]] are longer. The large size of the cones has earned them the nickname \"widowmakers\" among locals.\n\n==Ecology==\nThe Coulter pine is closely related to the [[Jeffrey pine]], with which it shares habitats, and the [[ponderosa pine]].<ref>[http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/pinjef/all.html Forest Service]</ref> Coulter pines tend to grow in drier environments than ponderosa and Jeffery pines.\n\nThis erect, medium-sized [[pine]] prefers south-facing slopes between {{convert|200|\u2013|2300|m|ft|abbr=on}} elevation, and tolerates dry rocky soil. ''Pinus coulteri'' most often appears in mixed forests. The Coulter pine occurs in a number of forest [[plant association]]s; for example, At higher elevations forestation of the [[San Jacinto Mountains]] Coulter Pine is co-dominant with the [[California black oak]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan, 2008</ref> [[Woodpecker]]s often forage on the species, and peel the bark to access insects underneath.<ref name=\"Moore2008\">{{cite book|author1=Moore, Gerry |author2=Kershner, Bruce |author3=Craig Tufts |author4=Daniel Mathews |author5=Gil Nelson |author6=Spellenberg, Richard |author7=Thieret, John W. |author8=Terry Purinton |author9=Block, Andrew |title=National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Trees of North America |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |year=2008 |page=86 |isbn=1-4027-3875-7}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nThe wood is weak and soft, so that the species is little used other than for firewood.\n\n''Pinus coulteri'' is cultivated as an [[ornamental tree]], planted in parks and large gardens, and [[xeriscaping|drought tolerant landscaping]].

It shares the common name creeping pine with several [[Creeping pine|other \"creeping pine\" plants]].\n\nThe whitebark pine is typically the highest-elevation [[pine]] tree of these mountains, marking the [[tree line]]. Thus, it is often found as ''[[krummholz]]'', trees dwarfed by exposure and growing close to the ground. In more favourable conditions, trees may grow to up to {{convert|29|m|sp=us}} in height.\n\n==Characteristics==\nWhitebark pine (''Pinus albicaulis'') is a member of the [[Pinus classification|white pine]] group, ''[[Pinus]]'' subgenus ''[[Strobus]]'', section ''[[Strobus]]'' and like all members of that group, the [[leaf|leaves]] ('needles') are in fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. This distinguishes whitebark pine and relatives from the [[lodgepole pine|lodgepole pine (''Pinus contorta'')]], with two needles per fascicle, and [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pine (''Pinus ponderosa'')]] and [[Jeffrey pine|Jeffrey pine (''Pinus jeffreyi'')]], which both have three per fascicle; these three all also have a persistent sheath at the base of each fascicle.\n\nDistinguishing whitebark pine (''Pinus albicaulis''), from the related [[Limber pine|limber pine (''Pinus flexilis'')]], also a \"white pine\", is much more difficult, and needs seed or pollen [[conifer cone|cones]]. In ''Pinus albicaulis'', the cones are {{convert|4|-|7|cm|sp=us}}  long, dark purple when immature, and do not open on drying, but the scales easily break when they are removed by [[Clark's nutcracker]] (see below) to harvest the seeds; rarely are there intact old cones under them. Its pollen cones are scarlet.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roady|first1=Laura|title=Whitebark Pine|url=http://fwp.mt.gov/mtoutdoors/HTML/articles/portraits/whitebarkpine.htm|website=Montana Outdoors|publisher=Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks|accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Pinus flexilis'', the cones are {{convert|6|-|12|cm|sp=us}} long, green when immature, and open to release the seeds; the scales are not fragile. Usually there are intact old cones under them. Their pollen cones are yellow.\n\n[[File:2013-07-12 15 55 36 Whitebark Pine pollen cones on Copper Mountain, Nevada.jpg|thumb|left|''Pinus albicaulis'' pollen cones]]\nWhitebark pine (''Pinus albicaulis'') can also be hard to distinguish from [[Western white pine|western white pine (''Pinus monticola'')]] in the absence of cones. However, whitebark pine needles are entire (smooth when rubbed gently in either direction), whereas western white pine needles are finely serrated (feeling rough when rubbed gently from tip to base). Whitebark pine needles are also usually shorter, {{convert|4|-|7|cm|sp=us}} long, overlapping in size with the larger {{convert|5|-|10|cm|sp=us}} needles of the western white pine.\n\n==Source of food==\n[[File:WhitebarkPine 7467t.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The whitebark pine, ''Pinus albicaulis'', at [[Mount Rainier National Park]]]]\nThe whitebark pine is an important source of food for many [[granivorous]] birds and small mammals, including most importantly the [[Clark's nutcracker]], the major seed disperser of the pine. Clark's nutcrackers each cache about 30,000 to 100,000&nbsp;each year in small, widely scattered caches usually under {{convert|2|to|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} of soil or gravelly substrate. Nutcrackers retrieve these seed caches during times of food scarcity and to feed their young. Cache sites selected by nutcrackers are often favorable for germination of seeds and survival of seedlings. Those caches not retrieved by the time the snow melts contribute to forest regeneration. Consequently, whitebark pine often grows in clumps of several trees, originating from a single cache of 2\u201315 or more seeds. [[Douglas squirrel]]s cut down and store whitebark pine cones in their [[midden]]s.  [[Grizzly bear]]s and [[American black bear]]s often raid squirrel middens for whitebark pine seeds, an important pre-hibernation food. Squirrels, [[northern flicker]]s, and [[mountain bluebird]]s often nest in whitebark pines, and elk and [[blue grouse]] use whitebark pine communities as summer habitat.\n\n==Threats==\n[[File:Tuolumne Meadows - Pywiack Dome summit - old pine - 2.JPG|thumb|left|''Pinus albicaulis'' is the only type of tree on the summit of [[Pywiack Dome]] in [[Yosemite National Park]].]]\nSevere population decline in whitebark pine communities is attributed to blister rust, the recent outbreak of mountain pine beetle (2000-2014), fire suppression, forest succession, wildland fire, and climate change.  A study in the mid-2000s showed that whitebark pine had declined by 41&nbsp;percent in the Western Cascades due to two threats: [[Cronartium ribicola|white pine blister rust]] and [[mountain pine beetle]]s.<ref name=\"seattle2011\"/> Whitebark deaths in [[North Cascades National Park]] doubled from 2006 to 2011.<ref name=\"seattle2011\"/>\n[[File:2013-07-12 13 42 54 Gnarled Whitebark Pine in the Copper Mountains of Nevada.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Stunted ''Pinus albicaulis'' in the [[Copper Mountains (Nevada)|Copper Mountains]] of northeastern Nevada]]\n\n===White pine blister rust===\n{{Further information|Cronartium ribicola}}\nMany stands of ''Pinus albicaulis'' nearly range-wide are infected with [[Cronartium ribicola|white pine blister rust (''Cronartium ribicola'')]], a fungal disease that was introduced from Europe. In the northern Rocky Mountains of the U.S., whitebark pine mortality in some areas exceeds 90&nbsp;percent, where the disease infests {{convert|143000|acre|km2}}.  ''Cronartium ribicola'' occurs in whitebark pine to the northern limits of the species in the coastal ranges of British Columbia and the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The blister rust has also devastated the commercially valuable western white pine in these areas, and made serious inroads in limber pine (''Pinus flexilis'') populations as well.  Nearly 80&nbsp;percent of whitebark pines in [[Mount Rainier National Park]] are infected with blister rust.<ref name=\"seattle2011\"/>\n\nThere is currently no way to stop the spread and effects of blister rust. However, a small number of trees (fewer than 5%) in most populations harbor genetic resistance to blister rust. There have been some restoration efforts by the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and National Park Service in the northern Rocky Mountains.  [[Restoration ecology|Restoration]] efforts involve harvesting cones from potentially and known resistant whitebark pines, growing seedlings, and outplanting seedlings in suitable sites.\n\nIn California, where the blister rust is far less severe, whitebark pine are still fairly common in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|High Sierras]].\n\n===Mountain pine beetle===\nThere are widespread outbreaks of [[mountain pine beetle]] in the western U.S. and Canada.<ref name=\"Moore2008\">{{cite book |author1=Moore, Gerry |author2=Kershner, Bruce |author3=Craig Tufts |author4=Daniel Mathews |author5=Gil Nelson |author6=Spellenberg, Richard |author7=Thieret, John W. |author8=Terry Purinton |author9=Block, Andrew |title=National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Trees of North America |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |year=2008 |page=80 |isbn=1-4027-3875-7}}</ref>  Since 2000, the climate at high elevations has warmed enough for the beetles to reproduce within whitebark pine, often completing their life cycle within one year and enabling their populations to grow exponentially.

It appears in the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[Colorado]] and northern [[New Mexico]], with an isolated population in the [[San Francisco Peaks]] in [[Arizona]]. It is usually found at very high altitudes, from 7,000' \u2013 13,000',<ref>http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/highelevationwhitepines/About/dist.htm</ref> in cold, dry [[subalpine climate]] conditions, often at the [[tree line]], although it also forms extensive closed-canopy stands at somewhat lower elevations.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Bristleconeflagstaff.jpg|thumb|left|A [[grove (nature)|grove]] of isolated Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine]]\n\n''Pinus aristata'' is a medium-size [[tree]], reaching {{convert|8|-|20|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|10|-|15|ft|m|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide.<ref>https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/all/pinus-aristata/</ref>  Mature trunk diameter is highly variable.  The bark is grey-brown, thin and scaly at the base of the trunk. The [[leaf|leaves]] ('needles') are in fascicles of five, stout, 2.5\u20134&nbsp;cm long, deep green to blue-green on the outer face, with [[stomata]] confined to a bright white band on the inner surfaces. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are ovoid-cylindrical, 5\u201310&nbsp;cm long and 3\u20134&nbsp;cm broad when closed, purple at first, ripening yellow-buff when 16 months old, with numerous thin, fragile scales, each scale with a bristle-like spine 4\u20138&nbsp;mm long.\n\nThe cones open to 4\u20136&nbsp;cm broad when mature, releasing the [[seed]]s immediately after opening. The seeds are 5&nbsp;mm long, with a 10\u201320&nbsp;mm wing; they are mostly dispersed by the wind, but some are also dispersed by [[Clark's Nutcracker]]s, which pluck the seeds out of the opening cones. The nutcrackers use the seeds as a food resource, storing many for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new plants.\n\n[[File:Pinus Aristata raisin flecks.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pine needle|Needles]] with the typical [[resin]] flecks]]\nIt differs most conspicuously from the two other bristlecone pine species in that the needles usually have only one, (only rarely two) resin canals, and these are commonly interrupted and broken, leading to highly characteristic small white resin flecks appearing on the needles. This character, which looks a bit like '[[dandruff]]' on the needles, is diagnostic of ''Pinus aristata''; no other pine shows it (though sometimes, [[scale insect]] infestations can look superficially similar).\n\nIt is a long-lived tree, though not attaining the longevity of ''[[Pinus longaeva]]''. The oldest known tree, which grows high on [[Black Mountain (near Craig, Colorado)|Black Mountain]] in Colorado, was found to have at 2,435-year tree ring record (and overall estimated age of 2,480 years, per Craig Brunstein) in 1992.<ref name=\"Moore2008\">{{cite book |author1=Moore, Gerry |author2=Kershner, Bruce |author3=Craig Tufts |author4=Daniel Mathews |author5=Gil Nelson |author6=Spellenberg, Richard |author7=Thieret, John W. |author8=Terry Purinton |author9=Block, Andrew |title=National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Trees of North America |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |year=2008 |page=823 |isbn=1-4027-3875-7}}</ref> However, trees rarely live over 1,500 years.\n\nThis species was previously described as a subspecies of ''[[Pinus balfouriana]]'' (''Pinus balfouriana aristata''). ''Pinus aristata'' is currently regarded as one of three closely related species known as [[bristlecone pine]]s and is sometimes named Rocky Mountains bristlecone pine or Colorado bristlecone pine.\nIn addition to its informal and regional names, the trees are referred to as the foxtail pine or hickory pine.\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Pinus aristata'' is by far the most common of the bristlecone pines in cultivation, where it is a very attractive slow-growing small tree suitable for small [[garden]]s in cold climates. Even so, it is never as long-lived as in the wild, typically living less than 100 years before it succumbs to root decay in the warmer, moister conditions prevalent in most inhabited places.\n\n==References and external links==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{IUCN2006|assessor=Conifer Specialist Group|year=1998|id=34057|title=Pinus aristata|downloaded=11 May 2006}}\n{{Commons|Pinus aristata}}\n\n*[http://www.conifers.org/pi/pin/aristata.htm Gymnosperm Database: ''Pinus aristata'']\n*[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233500922 Flora of North America: ''Pinus aristata'']\n*[http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/highelevationwhitepines/trees/RM-bristlecone.htm High-elevation white pine educational website: ''Pinus aristata'']\n*[http://hikearizona.com/dexcoder.php?PID=1614 HikeArizona.COM Images: ''Pinus aristata'']\n*[http://www.pinetum.org/cones/PNDucampopinus.htm Photo of cone (scroll to bottom of page)]\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=PIAR USDA Plants Profile: ''Pinus aristata'']\n\n[[Category:Pinus|aristata]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Rocky Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Near threatened flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Drought-tolerant plants]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]",

''latifolia'' forest 23 years before (above) and 10 years after (below) the [[Yellowstone fires of 1988]]}}\n\n''Pinus contorta'' is a fire-dependent species, requiring [[wildfire]]s to maintain healthy populations of diverse ages. The bark of the lodgepole pine is fairly thin, minimizing the tree's defense to fire; however, the heat of these [[closed-cone pine forest]] rejuvenating fires open the cones to release the seeds. This allows the species to regenerate and maintain its place in the forest habitat.<ref name=Schoennagel />\n\nExcessive wildfire prevention disrupts the [[fire ecology]]. The stands are usually so densely populated that the trees self-thin, or out-compete each other, leaving dead trees standing. These become a dry [[ladder fuel]] that can accelerate the fire to the crown of living trees. When the fire reaches the crowns of the trees, it can jump from tree to tree and becomes relatively unstoppable.\n\nThe natural fire regime for this species is primarily driven by climate. The fires occur most often after years of drought. ''Pinus contorta'' occurs from the upper montane to the subalpine region. These types of forests experience a lot of moisture in the form of snow in the winter due to their altitude. The density of the tree stand also prohibits the establishment of an understory. With all of that being said, the likelihood of a surface fire occurring is rare. Thus, infrequent but severe fires dominate this species.<ref name=Schoennagel>{{cite journal|last=Schoennagel|first=Tania|author2=Thomas Veblen |title=The Interaction of Fire, Fuels and Climate across Rocky Mountain Forests|journal=BioScience|volume=54|issue=7|year=2004|pages=661\u201376|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0661:TIOFFA]2.0.CO;2|issn=0006-3568}}</ref>\n\nAn example of the climate that plays a huge role in the fire regime of ''Pinus contorta'' is quite complex. There are three different oscillations that play a major role in droughts. These are the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) and El Nino (ENSO). A combination of these oscillations being in effect (+) or not in effect (-) have a global effect on the water available to these forests. So when the AMO +, ENSO \u2013 and PDO \u2013, there is going to be a drought and likely a severe subalpine fire.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kauffman|first=J.

A typical tipi is constructed using 15 to 18 pines.  The long, straight, and lightweight characteristics of the species made it ideal for horse transport in nomadic Plains [[buffalo hunting]] cultures.  Tribes made long journeys across the [[Great Plains]] to secure lodgepole pines that only grew in mountainous areas.  In Minnesota, other species such as [[red pine]] would be used in tipis, though they were generally thicker, heavier, and more cumbersome to transport than ''Pinus contorta''.\n\n''Pinus contorta'' is still used by many today for erecting tipis on [[American Indian reservation]]s, at [[powwow]]s, and at private homes.  The trees may be harvested for tipi poles in U.S. National Forests, provided the harvester secured a permit to cut living trees for ceremonial or traditional purposes.  The [[Bighorn Mountains]], the [[Black Hills]], and the [[Medicine Bow Mountains]] are popular tipi pole harvesting areas for Native Americans living on [[Plains Indians]] reservations in North and South Dakota, and immigrant tipi enthusiasts.\n\n=== Medicinal ===\nThe [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest]] and [[Indigenous peoples of California|of California]] used different parts of the plant internally and externally as a [[traditional medicine]] for various ailments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Pinus+contorta|title=results of search|work=umich.edu}}</ref>\n\n=== Cultivation ===\n''Pinus contorta'' is cultivated as an [[ornamental tree]] by the [[horticulture]] industry. [[plant nursery|Plant nurseries]] grow ''Pinus contorta'' subsp. ''contorta'' and ''Pinus contorta'' subsp. ''murrayana'' for use in traditional and [[wildlife garden]]s, and as smaller selections of the [[native plant]] for [[natural landscaping]]. The Shore pine's (ssp. ''contorta'') smaller varieties and cultivars are also used in [[container garden]]ing, including as large [[bonsai]] specimens.\n\n[[Cultivars]] of this species include:\n\n* ''Chief Joseph'', a dwarf variety of ''Pinus contorta var. latifolia'' grown for its yellow winter needles.\n* ''Spaan's Dwarf'', a dwarf variety of ''Pinus contorta var. contorta'' that grows wider than it grows tall.\n\n=== Emblem ===\nLodgepole pine is the [[Provincial tree emblems of Canada|Provincial tree]] of Alberta, Canada.\n\n== Invasive species ==\n''Pinus contorta'' is a serious [[invasive species]] of [[wilding conifer]] in [[New Zealand]], along with several other western North American pine species.

It is widespread and often abundant in this region, forming extensive open woodlands, usually mixed with [[juniper]]s in the [[pinyon-juniper woodland]] [[plant community]]. The Colorado pinyon (pi\u00f1on) grows as the dominant species on 4.8 million acres ({{convert|19,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in Colorado, making up 22% of the state's forests. The Colorado pinyon has cultural meaning to agriculture, as strong pi\u00f1on wood \"plow heads\" were used to break soil for crop planting at the state's earliest known agricultural settlements.\n\nThere is one known example of a Colorado pinyon growing amongst Engelmann spruce (''[[Picea engelmannii]]'') and limber pine (''[[Pinus flexilis]]'') at nearly {{convert|3170|m}} on [[Kendrick Peak]] in the Kaibab National Forest of northern Arizona.\n\n==Description==\nThe pi\u00f1on pine (''Pinus edulis'') is a small to medium size [[tree]], reaching {{convert|10|-|20|m|ft}} tall and with a trunk diameter of up to {{convert|80|cm|in}}, rarely more. The bark is irregularly furrowed and scaly. The [[leaf|leaves]] ('needles') are in pairs, moderately stout, {{convert|3|-|5.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, and green, with [[stomata]] on both inner and outer surfaces but distinctly more on the inner surface forming a whitish band.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|cones]] are globose, {{convert|3|-|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-buff when 18\u201320 months old, with only a small number of thick scales, with typically 5\u201310 fertile scales. The cones open to {{convert|4|-|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} broad when mature, holding the [[seed]]s on the scales after opening. The seeds are {{convert|10|-|14|mm|in}} long, with a thin shell, a white [[endosperm]], and a vestigial {{convert|1|-|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} wing; they are dispersed by the [[pinyon jay]], which plucks the seeds out of the open cones. The jay, which uses the seeds as a food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees.\n\nThe species intermixes with Pinus monophylla sbsp. fallax (see description under [[Pinus monophylla]]) for several hundred kilometers along the Mogollon Rim of central Arizona and the Grand Canyon resulting in trees with both single- and two-needled fascicles on each branch.  The frequency of two-needled fascicles increases following wet years and decreases following dry years.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=Ken|last2=Fisher|first2=Jessica|last3=Arundel|first3=Samantha|last4=Canella|first4=John|last5=Swift|first5=Sandra|title=Geographical and climatic limits of needle types of one- and two-needled pinyon pines|journal=Journal of Biogeography|date=2008|volume=35|pages=357\u2013369|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2007.01786.x}}</ref>  The internal anatomy of both these needle types are identical except for the number of needles in each fascicle suggesting that Little's 1968 designation <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Little|first1=Elbert|title=Two new pinyon varieties from Arizona|journal=Phytologica|date=1968|volume=17|pages=329\u2013342}}</ref> of this tree as a variety of Pinus edulis is more likely than its subsequent designation as a subspecies of Pinus monophylla based entirely upon its single needle fascicle.\n\n==History==\nColorado pinyon was described by [[George Engelmann]] in 1848 from collections made near [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] on [[Alexander William Doniphan]]'s expedition to northern Mexico in 1846.\n\nIt is most closely related to the [[single-leaf pinyon]], which [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridises]] with it occasionally where their ranges meet in western Arizona and Utah. It is also closely related to the [[Texas pinyon]], but is separated from it by a gap of about {{convert|100|km|mi}} so does not hybridise with it.\n\nAn isolated population of trees in the [[New York Mountains]] of southeast [[California]], previously thought to be Colorado pinyons, have recently been shown to be a two-needled variant of single-leaf pinyon from chemical and genetic evidence. Occasional two-needled pinyons in northern [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]] have sometimes been referred to Colorado pinyon in the past, but are now known to be hybrids between single-leaf pinyon and [[Parry pinyon]].\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Pinus edulis Snowpeak.jpg|thumb|Cones of ''P.&nbsp;edulis'']]\nThe [[List of edible seeds|edible seeds]], [[pine nut]]s, are extensively collected throughout its range; in many areas, the seed harvest rights are owned by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes, for whom the species is of immense cultural and economic importance. One early legend asserts that the \"tree of life\" is a pinyon pine, rooted in ancient cultural sites found within areas of pinyon (pi\u00f1on) Canyon, Colorado.\n\nThe [[habitat destruction]] by [[deforestation]] of large areas of pinyon forests in the interests of [[cattle]] ranching, for habitat conversion to [[grazing]] [[rangeland]], is seen by many as an act of major ecological and cultural vandalism.\n\nColorado pinyon is also occasionally planted as an ornamental tree and sometimes used as a [[Christmas tree]].\n\nThe pi\u00f1on pine (''Pinus edulis'') is the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[New Mexico]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Habitat fragmentation]]\n\n==References==\n{{notes}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*Ronald M.

This [[pine]] is a medium-sized species with a height of 20\u201330 m and a trunk diameter of 35\u201380&nbsp;cm.\n\nThe branches are sparse and very stout, giving the tree a distinct appearance. The needles, among the longest of any pine, are in bundles of three (occasionally five), 20\u201340&nbsp;cm long, stout, and spreading to slightly drooping. The cones are 8\u201316&nbsp;cm long, green or purple when growing, maturing glossy brown, moderately oblique with stoutly spined scales on the outer side (facing away from the branch). The Apache pine sometimes shows a grass stage like the related [[Michoacan pine]] (''P. devoniana'') and also longleaf pine (''[[Pinus palustris|P. palustris]]'').\n\nThe English name refers to the species' occurrence in the lands of the [[Apache Tribe|Apache]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], while the scientific name commemorates the pioneering American botanist [[George Engelmann]] who discovered the species in 1848. Engelmann first named the species ''Pinus macrophylla'', but this name had already been used for another pine, so it had to be renamed; this was done by the French botanist Carri\u00e8re, who chose to honour Engelmann.\n\nApache pine was sometimes treated as a variety of ponderosa pine in the past (as ''[[Pinus ponderosa|P. ponderosa]]'' var. ''mayriana''), but it is now universally regarded as a distinct species.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{commonscat-inline|Pinus engelmannii|''Pinus engelmannii''}}\n*{{wikispecies-inline}}\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=PIEN2 NRCS: USDA Plants Profile ''Pinus engelmannii''], AZ: [http://plants.usda.gov/java/county?state_name=Arizona&statefips=04&symbol=PIEN2], NM: [http://plants.usda.gov/java/county?state_name=New%20Mexico&statefips=35&symbol=PIEN2]\n\n[[Category:Pinus|engelmannii]]\n[[Category:Trees of Northern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Least concern plants]]",

In favourable conditions, it makes a tree to {{convert|20|m|ft|round=5|sp=us}}, rarely {{convert|25|m|ft|round=5|sp=us}} tall.  However, on exposed treeline sites, mature trees are much smaller, reaching heights of only {{convert|5|-|10|m|ft|round=5|sp=us}}.<ref name=\"Moore2008\" />  In steeply-sloping, rocky, and windswept terrain in the Rocky Mountains of southern Alberta, limber pine is even more stunted, occurring in old stands where mature trees are consistently less than {{convert|3|m|ft|0}} in height.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Letts|first1=M.G.|first2=K.N.|last2=Nakonechny|first3=K.E.|last3=Van Gaalen|first4=C.M.|last4=Smith|year=2009|url=http://people.uleth.ca/~matthew.letts/Letts%20et%20al%202009%20CJFR.pdf|title=Physiological acclimation of ''Pinus flexilis'' to drought stress on contrasting slope aspects in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada|journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research|volume=39|issue=3|pages=629\u2013641|doi=10.1139/X08-206}}</ref>\n\nOne of the world's oldest living Limber Pine trees grows on the banks of the upper North Saskatchewan River at Whirlpool Point in Alberta.\nRecent measurements give a maximum girth of 185\".  In 1986 a core sample 10cm  was retrieved by two researchers who counted 400 rings.\nExtrapolating his data gives an age close to 3000 years.\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Limberpinecone.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Limber pine cone from [[San Jacinto Mountains]], [[Peninsular Ranges]]]]\n''P. flexilis'',  is an important source of food for several species, including [[pine squirrel|red squirrels]] and [[Clark's nutcracker]]s. [[American black bear]]s may raid squirrel caches for limber pine nuts. Squirrels, [[Northern flicker]]s, and [[mountain bluebird]]s often nest in the trees.\n\n== Related species ==\n''P. flexilis'' is a member of the [[Pinus classification|white pine]] group, ''[[Pinus]]'' subgenus ''[[Strobus]]'', and like all members of that group, the leaves ('needles') are in [[fascicle (botany)|fascicles]] (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. This distinguishes it from the [[lodgepole pine]], with two needles per fascicle, and the [[bristlecone pine]]s, which share five needles per fascicle but have a semi-persistent sheath.\n[[File:Pinus flexilis male cones.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Male cones of a limber pine, eastern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], California]]\n\n=== ''Pinus albicaulis'' ===\nDistinguishing limber pine from the related [[whitebark pine]] (''P. albicaulis''), also a white pine, is very much more difficult, and can only easily be done by the cones. In limber pine, the cones are {{convert|6-12|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long where the species overlap, green when immature, and open to release the seeds; the scales are not fragile. In whitebark pine, the cones are {{convert|4|-|7|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long, dark purple when immature, and do not open on drying, but are fragile and are pulled apart by birds (see below) to release the seeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinetum.org/cones/PNStrobus.htm|title=''Pinus'' subgenus ''Strobus''|work=Michael P. Frank's Cone Collection|publisher=Arboretum de Villardebelle}}</ref> A useful clue is that whitebark pines almost never have intact old cones lying under them, whereas limber pines usually do.\n<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roady|first1=Laura|title=Whitebark Pine|url=http://fwp.mt.gov/mtoutdoors/HTML/articles/portraits/whitebarkpine.htm|website=Montana Outdoors|publisher=Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks|accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Pinus monticola'' ===\nIn the absence of cones, limber pine can also be hard to tell from [[Western white pine]] (''P. monticola'') where they occur together in the northern Rockies and the Sierra Nevada east slope. The most useful clue here is that limber pine needles are entire (smooth when rubbed gently in both directions), whereas Western white pine needles are finely serrated (feeling rough when rubbed gently from tip to base). Limber pine needles are also usually shorter, {{convert|4|-|7|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long, while western white pine needles are {{convert|5|-|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}}, though the ranges overlap.\n\n== Diseases ==\nLimber pine is susceptible to [[white pine blister rust]], caused by ''Cronartium ribicola'', a fungus that was introduced accidentally from Europe. Limber pine mortality is high in many areas throughout its range, except [[Arizona]], where it has not yet been found. However, there is little hope of controlling the blister rust in existing trees. Research is under way, locating and breeding from the occasional naturally resistant limber pines, and by studying the resistance mechanisms of the European and Asian white pines (e.g. [[Swiss pine]], [[Macedonian pine]]), which are strongly resistant to the disease.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nThe popular [[cultivar]] ''P. flexilis'' 'Vanderwolf's Pyramid' is widely available as an [[ornamental tree]] for [[garden]]s. 'Vanderwolf's Pyramid' derives from ''P. reflexa'', though it is usually listed in nursery catalogs under ''P. flexilis''.\n\nThe Southwestern white pine is popular as a windbreak tree or an ornamental tree due to its drought tolerance.  It is also grown as a [[Christmas tree]], liked for the soft needles but with stiffer branches than an [[Eastern white pine]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Burmis Tree]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Further reading ===\n* {{cite book | last1 = Chase| first1 = J.

The range extends from southeast [[Arizona]] and southwest [[New Mexico]], [[United States]], south in [[Mexico]] along the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] and the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] to southern [[Zacatecas]] and [[San Luis Potos\u00ed (state)|San Luis Potos\u00ed]]. It occurs at moderate to high altitudes, from {{convert|1600|-|3000|m|ft}}, in cool, dry climate conditions.\n\n==Description==\n''Pinus johannis'' is a small to medium-size [[tree]], often just a [[shrub]], reaching {{convert|4|-|10|m|ft}}  tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 50&nbsp;cm. The bark is grey-brown, thin and scaly at the base of the trunk. The [[leaf|leaves]] ('needles') are in mixed fascicles of three and four, slender, 3\u20136&nbsp;cm long, and deep green to blue-green, with [[stomata]] confined to a bright white band on the inner surfaces.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|cones]] are globose, 2\u20134&nbsp;cm long and 2\u20133&nbsp;cm broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-brown when 16\u201318 months old, with only a small number of thin, fragile scales, typically 6-12 fertile scales. The cones open to 3\u20135&nbsp;cm broad when mature, holding the [[seed]]s on the scales after opening. The seeds are 9\u201312&nbsp;mm long, with a thick shell, a white [[endosperm]], and a vestigial 1\u20132&nbsp;mm wing; they are dispersed by the [[Mexican jay]], which plucks the seeds out of the open cones. The jay, which uses the seeds as a major food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use; some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees.\n\n==History==\n''Pinus johannis'' is a recently described [[pinyon pine]], discovered by [[Elbert L. Little]] in 1968 when comparing pinyons growing in Arizona with those of typical Mexican pinyon (''[[Pinus cembroides]]'') in Mexico; he described it as a [[variety (biology)|variety]] of Mexican pinyon, ''Pinus cembroides'' var. ''bicolor'', noting the very different stomatal placing on the leaves; it also differs in needle number, with 3\u20134 per fascicle, rather than 2\u20133; in the cones having thinner scales; and in having a denser, more rounded crown. Further research by the French botanist Marie-Fran\u00e7oise Robert-Passini, the American botanists Dana K. Bailey and Frank G. Hawksworth and others, has shown that it is better treated as a distinct [[species]]. Although often occurring together with Mexican pinyon, it is reproductively isolated from that by its [[pollination]] being a month to two months later in summer, rather than in spring, thereby preventing [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]].\n\nAs Robert-Passini and Bailey & Hawksworth were working in different areas at about the same time, it was raised to species rank twice, first as ''Pinus johannis'' by Robert-Passini (naming it after her husband Jean) examining specimens in the Sierra Madre Oriental in Mexico, and then later as ''Pinus discolor'' by Bailey & Hawksworth examining specimens in the northern Sierra Madre Occidental in Arizona.\n\nThere are slight differences between the plants in the two ranges; those in the eastern being more shrubby and with larger cones than those in the western range, and also differences in the [[resin]] composition; they are though generally very similar and recognition of both as separate species from each other does not appear warranted.\n\nSome botanists also still include ''P.&nbsp;johannis'' in Mexican pinyon as a variety or even not distinguished at all, accounting for reports of \"Mexican pinyon\" in Arizona and New Mexico. This is despite the two frequently occurring together at the same sites with no hybridisation.\n\n''P.&nbsp;johannis'' is most closely allied to Orizaba pinyon (''[[Pinus orizabensis]]'') and Potosi pinyon (''[[Pinus culminicola]]''), with which it shares the leaf structure with the stomata confined to the inner faces; it differs from the former in the smaller cones and seeds, and from the latter in fewer needles per fascicle (3-4 vs 5).\n\n==Uses==\nThe edible [[pine nut]] seeds are collected in Mexico to a small extent.\n\nThe white-glaucous inner surfaces of the needles make it a very attractive small tree, suitable for [[park]]s and large [[garden]]s.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.pinetum.org/PhotoMPF.htm Pinetum.org - Photos of ''Pinus johannis'' tree and foliage (scroll half-way down)]\n*[http://www.pinetum.org/cones/PNDucampopinus.htm Pinetum.org - Photo of cones (scroll half-way down)]\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Pinus|johannis]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of Northwestern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Flora of Northeastern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Flora of Sonora]]\n[[Category:Flora of Zacatecas]]\n[[Category:Flora of San Luis Potos\u00ed]]\n[[Category:Flora of Arizona]]\n[[Category:Flora of New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Sierra Madre Occidental]]\n[[Category:Sierra Madre Oriental]]\n[[Category:Edible nuts and seeds]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Drought-tolerant trees]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1978]]",

The second tallest recorded was \"Yosemite Giant\", an {{convert|82.05|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall specimen in [[Yosemite National Park]], which died from a bark beetle attack in 2007. The tallest, known, living specimens today grow in southern [[Oregon]] and [[Yosemite National Park]]: one in Umpqua National Forest is {{convert|77.7|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall and another in Siskiyou National Forest is {{convert|77.2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall. [[Yosemite National Park]] also has the third tallest, measured to {{convert|80.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall as of June 2013; the Rim Fire affected this specimen, but it survived.\n\n''Pinus lambertiana'' is a member of the [[Pinus classification|white pine]] group, ''Pinus'' subgenus ''Strobus'', and, like all members of that group, the [[leaf|leaves]] (\"needles\") grow in [[fascicle (botany)|fascicles]] (\"bundles\") of five, with a deciduous sheath. They are {{convert|6|\u2013|11|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}}ch) long. Sugar pine is notable for having the longest [[conifer cone|cones]] of any conifer, mostly {{convert|25|\u2013|50|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long, exceptionally to {{convert|66|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long, although the cones of the [[Coulter pine]] are more massive.

The Mexican range extends along the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] and [[Sierra Madre del Sur]] from [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] to [[Oaxaca]], from 29\u00b0 North Lat. to 17\u00b0, between 1600 and 3000&nbsp;meters altitude. It requires about a rainfall 600 to 1000&nbsp;mm a year, mostly in summer. It tolerates frosts in winter.\n\n==Description==\nThis member of family [[Pinaceae]] grows to the height of 20&ndash;30 m with a trunk diameter of 35&ndash;80&nbsp;cm. The needles are in bundles of three to five, 5&ndash;10&nbsp;cm (rarely to 15&nbsp;cm) long, and are a bright glossy green to yellowish-green. The cones are ovoid, 4&ndash;7&nbsp;cm (rarely to 8&nbsp;cm) long, and borne on a 1&ndash;2&nbsp;cm long stalk; they are unusual in taking about 30&ndash;32 months to mature, a year longer than most other [[pine]]s. The bark is gray-brownish, and fissured.\n\n==Subspecies==\nThere are two subspecies (treated by some botanists as distinct species, by others as just varieties):\n*''Pinus leiophylla'' subsp. ''leiophylla''. Needles slender (0.5&ndash;0.9&nbsp;mm), in fives. It occurs in the southern part of the range, from [[Oaxaca]] to [[Durango]], is not frost tolerant, and grows in relatively high rainfall conditions.\n*''Pinus leiophylla'' subsp. ''chihuahuana''. Needles stouter (0.9&ndash;1.3&nbsp;mm), in threes. It occurs in the northern part of the range, from Durango to Arizona, tolerates frost down to about &minus;10&nbsp;\u00b0C to &minus;15&nbsp;\u00b0C, and very dry conditions.

The only other pines to do this are [[Pitch Pine]] (''P. rigida'') and [[Canary Island Pine]] (''P. canariensis''). As none of these are species particularly closely related to each other, the adaptation has probably arisen independently in each, an example of [[convergent evolution]].\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\nThe wood of the ''Pinus leiophylla'' is hard, dense and strong. It is used for construction, firewood, and railroad ties. In [[South Africa]] and [[Queensland]], Australia there are big extensions of this tree planted. It is planted commercially in [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]] at high altitudes.\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/county?state_name=Arizona&statefips=04&symbol=PILE County Distribution in Arizona], from plants.usda.gov\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/county?state_name=New%20Mexico&statefips=35&symbol=PILE County Distribution in New Mexico], from plants.usda.gov\n*[http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/pinus-leiophylla-chihuahua-pine-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map of ''Pinus leiophylla''], from plantmaps.com\n\n<!-- For the name of the Mexican state of Chihuahua -->\n\n[[Category:Pinus|leiophylla]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puebla]]\n[[Category:Trees of Northern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Durango]]\n[[Category:Trees of Chihuahua (state)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of Northeastern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1831]]\n[[Category:Trees of temperate climates]]\n[[Category:Drought-tolerant trees]]\n[[Category:Least concern plants]]",

The bark is bright orange-yellow, thin and scaly at the base of the trunk.

The leaves show the longest persistence of any plant, with some remaining green for 45 years (Ewers & Schmid 1981).\n\n[[File:ConeBristles.jpg|thumb|Detail of cone from a bristlecone pine, [[Snake Range]], [[Nevada]]]]\nThese ancient trees have a gnarled and stunted appearance, especially those found at high altitudes,<ref name=\"FEIS\"/> and have reddish-brown bark with deep fissures.<ref name=Conifers>{{cite web|url=http://www.conifers.org/|title=The Gymnosperm Database|date=March 2008|accessdate=30 July 2011}}</ref> As the tree ages, much of its [[vascular cambium]] layer may die. In very old specimens, often only a narrow strip of living tissue connects the roots to a handful of live branches.\n\n[[File:2015-07-13 07 46 24 Great Basin Bristlecone Pine leaves and pollen cones along the North Loop Trail about 5.6 miles west of the trailhead in the Mount Charleston Wilderness, Nevada.jpg|thumb|Foliage and pollen cones, [[Spring Mountains]], Nevada]]\nThe [[conifer cone|cones]] are ovoid-cylindrical, {{convert|5|to|10|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|to|4|cm|abbr=on}} broad when closed, green or purple at first, ripening orange-buff when 16 months old, with numerous thin, fragile scales, each scale with a bristle-like spine {{convert|2|to|5|mm|abbr=on}} long.

The Great Basin bristlecone pine differs from the [[Pinus balfouriana|foxtail pine]] because the cone bristles of the former are over {{convert|2|mm|abbr=on}} long, and the cones have a more rounded (not conic) base. The green pine needles give the twisted branches a bottle-brush appearance. The name 'bristlecone pine' refers to the dark purple female cones that bear incurved prickles on their surface.<ref name=\"Sonic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sonic.net/bristlecone/home.html|title=The Ancient Bristlecone Pine|date=August 2003|accessdate=30 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution and ecology==\nThe species occurs in [[Utah]], [[Nevada]] and eastern [[California]]. In California, it is restricted to the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]], the [[Inyo Mountains]], and the [[Panamint Range]], in [[Mono County|Mono]] and [[Inyo County|Inyo]] counties. In Nevada, it is found in most of the higher ranges of the [[Basin and Range Province|Basin and Range]] from the [[Spring Mountains]] near [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] north to the [[Ruby Mountains]], and in Utah, northeast to South Tent in the [[Wasatch Range]].\n\n[[Image:Bristlecone hillside.jpg|thumb|Bristlecones spread out on dolomite hillside, [[Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest]]]]\nThe tree grows in large open stands, unlike the related [[foxtail pine]], which sometimes form dense forests. ''Pinus longaeva'' trees generally don't form closed canopies, usually covering only 15-50%.<ref name=\"redlist\"/> ''Pinus longaeva'' shares habitats with a number of other pine species, including the [[ponderosa pine]], the [[white fir]] and, notably, the [[limber pine]], a similarly long-lived high-elevation species.<ref name=\"FEIS\"/> The tree is a \"vigorous\" [[primary succession]] species, growing quickly on new open ground.<ref name=\"FEIS\"/> It is a \"poor competitor\" in good soils, however, and the species does best in harsh terrain. ''Pinus longaeva'' is often the dominant species in high-elevation dolomite soils, where few plants can grow.<ref name=\"FEIS\"/>\n\nBristlecone pines are protected in a number of areas owned by the United States federal government, such as the [[Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest]] in the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]] of California and the [[Great Basin National Park]] in Nevada.<ref name=Sonic/><ref name=Global>{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltrees.org|title=Global Trees Campaign|date=March 2008|accessdate=30 July 2011}}</ref> These areas prohibit the cutting or gathering of wood.<ref name=Global/>\n\n[[Clark's nutcracker]]s pluck ''P. longaeva'' seeds out of the opening cones. The nutcrackers use the seeds as a food resource, storing many for later use in the ground, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new plants.\n\nAn introduced fungal disease known as white pine blister rust (''[[Cronartium ribicola]]'') is believed to affect some individuals. The species was placed on the [[IUCN Red List]] and listed as \"Vulnerable\", or [[threatened species|threatened]], in 1998.<ref>{{IUCN2006|assessor=Conifer Specialist Group|year=1998|id=34024|title=Pinus longaeva|downloaded=11 May 2006}}</ref> In 2011, however, a population survey found the population of ''Pinus longaeva'' to be stable, with no known subpopulations decreasing in size. White pine blister rust was found to have a negligible effect on the population. As a result, the species was moved to \"Least Concern\".<ref name=\"redlist\">{{IUCN2015.2|assessor=Stritch, L.|assessor2=Mahalovich, M.|assessor3=Nelson, K.G.|last-assessor-amp=yes |year=2011 |id=34024 |title=Pinus longaeva |downloaded=2015-08-06}}</ref>\n\n===Fire ecology===\nThe tree is extremely vulnerable to fire, and is damaged by even low-intensity burns. The resinous bark is capable of igniting quickly, and a crown fire will almost certainly kill the tree. However, populations of ''Pinus longaeva'' are known to be extremely resilient, and as a primary succession species, it is believed that populations of the tree would reestablish itself quickly after a fire. That said, large-scale fires are extremely uncommon where the species grows, and are not a major factor in the species' long-term viability.<ref name=\"FEIS\"/>\n\n==Age==\n[[Image:Bristlecone CA.JPG|thumb|Bristlecone pine, White Mountains, California]]\nA specimen of this species, located in the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains of California]] was measured by Tom Harlan, a researcher with the [[Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research]], to be 5,062 years old in 2012.<ref name=oldest/> The identity of the specimen is being kept secret by Harlan.<ref name=collweekly>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/oldest-living-tree-tells-all/|title=Read My Rings: The Oldest Living Tree Tells All|accessdate=2014-07-27|publisher=Collectors Weekly|author=Oatman-Stanford, Hunter}}</ref> This is the [[oldest tree|oldest known]] tree in North America, and the oldest known individual tree in the world, although a [[Vegetative cloning|clonal]] individual, nicknamed \"[[Old Tjikko]]\", a [[Norway spruce]] in Sweden is 9,550 years old.<ref>[http://www.info.umu.se/NYHETER/PressmeddelandeEng.aspx?id=3061 World\u2019s oldest living tree discovered in Sweden] (Ume\u00e5 University Press Release, 16 April 2008)</ref><ref name=natgeo>{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/04/080414-oldest-tree.html|title=Oldest Living Tree Found in Sweden|accessdate=2008-05-06|publisher=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|author=Owen, James}}</ref>\n\nThe previously oldest named specimen of this species, \"[[Methuselah (tree)|Methuselah]]\", is also located in the [[Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest]] of the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]].

The range is in southernmost [[Idaho]], western [[Utah]], [[Arizona]], southwest [[New Mexico]], [[Nevada]], eastern and southern [[California]] and northern [[Baja California]].\n\nIt occurs at moderate altitudes from {{convert|1200|m|ft|sing=on}} - {{convert|2300|m|ft|sing=on}}, rarely as low as {{convert|950|m|ft|sing=on}} and as high as {{convert|2900|m|ft|sing=on}}. It is widespread and often abundant in this region, forming extensive open woodlands, often mixed with [[juniper]]s in the [[Pinyon-juniper woodland]] [[plant community]]. Single-leaf Pinyon is the world's only 1-needled pine.<ref name=\"Moore2008\">Gerry Moore et al. 2008</ref>\n\n[[File:2013-06-27 14 53 26 Single-leaf Pinyon on Spruce Mountain, Nevada.jpg|thumb|''Pinus monophylla'' on [[Spruce Mountain (Nevada)|Spruce Mountain]], Nevada]]\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Pinyon pine Pinus monophylla needles close.jpg|left|thumb|170px|''Pinus monophylla'', closeup of the single needle in each sheath]]\n\n===Species===\n[[Image:Pinyon pine cones Pinus monophylla.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Pinyon pine 2-year cone cycle]]\n''Pinus monophylla'' is a small to medium size [[tree]], reaching {{convert|10|m|ft|sing=on}}-{{convert|20|m|ft|sing=on}} tall and with a trunk diameter of up to {{convert|80|cm|in|sing=on}} rarely more. The bark is irregularly furrowed and scaly. The [[leaf|leaves]] ('needles') are, uniquely for a pine, usually single (not two or more in a fascicle, though trees with needles in pairs are found occasionally), stout, {{convert|4|cm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|6|cm|in|sing=on}} long, and grey-green to strongly glaucous blue-green, with [[stomata]] over the whole needle surface (and on both inner and outer surfaces of paired needles). The [[conifer cone|cones]] are acute-globose, the largest of the true pinyons, {{convert|4.5|cm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|8|cm|in|sing=on}} long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-buff when 18\u201320 months old, with only a small number of very thick scales, typically 8-20 fertile scales. The cones thus grow over a two-year (26-month) cycle, so that newer green and older, seed-bearing or open brown cones are on the tree at the same time (see image at left).\n\n[[Image:Pinyon with pine nuts in cone.jpg|right|thumb|190px|Open cone with empty pine nuts]]\nThe cones open to {{convert|6|cm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|9|cm|in|sing=on}} broad when mature, holding the [[seed]]s on the scales after opening. The seeds are {{convert|11|mm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|16|mm|in|sing=on}} long, with a thin shell, a white [[endosperm]], and a vestigial {{convert|1|mm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|2|mm|in|sing=on}} wing. Empty pine nuts with undeveloped seeds (self-pollinated) are a light tan color, while the \"good\" ones are dark brown.<ref name=\"Lanner1981\">Ronald M. Lanner 1981</ref> The pine nuts are dispersed by the [[pinyon jay]], which plucks the seeds out of the open cones, choosing only the dark ones and leaving the light ones (as in image at right).  The jay, which uses the seeds as a food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use by burying them. Some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees.  Indeed, Pinyon seeds will rarely germinate in the wild unless they are cached by jays or other animals.\n\n===Subspecies and genetics===\n\nThere are three subspecies:\n*''Pinus monophylla'' subsp. ''monophylla''. Most of the range, except for the areas below. Needles more stout, bright blue-green, with 2-7 resin canals and 8-16 stomatal lines. Cones are {{convert|5.5|cm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|8|cm|in|sing=on}} long, often longer than broad.\n[[Image:Pinyon snowSilh.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Mature Pinus monophylla subsp. monophylla in snow, Mono Co.

Southernmost Nevada, southwest through southeastern California (northwest only as far as the [[San Jacinto Mountains]]) to 29\u00b0N in northern Baja California. Needles less stout, gray-green, with 8-16 resin canals and 13-18 stomatal lines. Cones are {{convert|4.5|cm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|6|cm|in|sing=on}} long, broader than long.\n*''Pinus monophylla'' subsp. ''fallax'' (E. L. Little) D.K. Bailey. Slopes of the lower [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] valley and adjacent tributaries from [[St. George, Utah]] to the [[Hualapai Mountains]], and along the lower flank of the [[Mogollon Rim]] to [[Silver City, New Mexico]]. Needles less stout, gray-green, with 2-3 resin canals and 8-16 stomatal lines. Cones are {{convert|4.5|cm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|6|cm|in|sing=on}} long, broader than long.\n\nIt is most closely related to the [[Colorado pinyon]], which [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridises]] with it (both subsps. ''monophylla'' and ''fallax'') occasionally where their ranges meet in western Arizona and Utah. It also (subsp. ''californiarum'') hybridises extensively with [[Parry pinyon]].  This classification of pinyon species based only upon the presence of single-needle fascicles is brought into doubt by the reporting of trees from both the Pinus monophylla/Pinus edulis and the Pinus monophylla subsp. fallax/Pinus edulis zones as growing more single needle fascicles after dry years and more two-needled fascicles after wet years.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tausch|first1=R.J.|last2=West|first2=N.E.|editor=Everett, R.L.

When the [[railroad]]s penetrated these areas, imported [[coal]] supplanted locally produced charcoal.\n\nFollowing the resulting re-establishment of pinyon woodlands after the charcoal era, many [[cattle]] [[rancher]]s became concerned that these woodlands provided decreased [[livestock]] [[Fodder|forage]] in [[grazing]] [[rangeland]].  Efforts to clear these woodlands, with [[deforestation]] often using a surplus [[battleship]] chain dragged between two [[bulldozer]]s, peaked in the 1950s, but were subsequently abandoned when no long term forage increase resulted.  The [[habitat destruction]] of large areas of Pinyon woodlands in the interests of [[mining]] and cattle ranching is seen by many as an act of major ecological and cultural vandalism.<ref name=\"Lanner1981\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pinyon pine]]s\n*[[Pinyon-juniper woodland]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* C.

The [[bark]] helps to distinguish it from other species. Mature to over-mature individuals have yellow to orange-red bark in broad to very broad plates with black crevices. Younger trees have blackish-brown bark, referred to as \"blackjacks\" by early loggers. Ponderosa pine's five [[subspecies]], as classified by some botanists, can be identified by their characteristically bright, green needles (contrasting with blue-green needles that distinguish [[Jeffrey pine]]). The Pacific subspecies has the longest\u2014{{convert|19.8|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}\u2014and most flexible needles in plume-like [[Fascicle (botany)|fascicles]] of three. The Columbia ponderosa pine has long\u2014{{convert|12.0|\u2013|20.5|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}\u2014and relatively flexible needles in fascicles of three. The Rocky Mountains subspecies has shorter\u2014{{convert|9.2|\u2013|14.4|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}\u2014and stout needles growing in scopulate (bushy, tuft-like) fascicles of two or three.

Downloaded on 31 July 2013.</ref> and '''fourleaf pinyon pine'''.<ref name=ns/>\n\n==Description==\n''Pinus quadrifolia'' is a small to medium size [[tree]], reaching {{convert|8|m|ft}} to {{convert|15|m|ft}} tall and with a trunk diameter of up to {{convert|40|cm|in}}, rarely more. The bark is thick, rough and scaly. The [[leaf|leaves]] ('needles') are in fascicles of 4\u20135, moderately stout, {{convert|2.5|cm|in}}\u2013{{convert|5.5|cm|in}} long; glossy dark green with no [[stomata]] on the outer face, and a dense bright white band of stomata on the inner surfaces. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are globose, {{convert|4|cm|in}}\u2013{{convert|5.5|cm|in}} long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow to orange-buff when 18\u201320 months old, with only a small number of thick scales, with typically 5\u201310 fertile scales. \n\nThe cones open to {{convert|5|cm|in}} to {{convert|7|cm|in}} broad when mature, holding the [[seed]]s on the scales after opening. The seeds are {{convert|10|mm|in}}\u2013{{convert|14|mm|in}} long, with a thin shell, a white [[endosperm]], and a vestigial {{convert|1|mm|in}}\u2013{{convert|2|mm|in}} wing; they are dispersed by the [[pinyon jay]], which plucks the seeds out of the open cones. The jay, which uses the seeds as a food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees.\n\n===Hybrids===\nThe Parry pinyon frequently [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridises]] with [[Pinus monophylla|single-leaf pinyon]] (''P. monophylla'') where their ranges meet in southern California and northern Baja California. Hybrids are distinguished by intermediate features, with needles usually fascicles of 2\u20133 with some stomata on the outer surface. It has been suggested by some [[botanist]]s that the [[holotype]] specimen of ''P. quadrifolia'' is itself from a hybrid; presumed pure, non-hybrid specimens having been given the new name ''Pinus juarezensis'', the Ju\u00e1rez pinyon, after the [[Sierra de Ju\u00e1rez]] of northern Baja California. However, there is no proof that these specimens are genetically 'purer' than the original type specimen, and few botanists accept ''P. juarezensis'' as other than a synonym of ''P. quadrifolia''.\n\nDespite the ease of hybridisation with single-leaf pinyon, Parry pinyon is genetically probably more closely related to the [[Pinus johannis|Johann's pinyon]] (''P. johannis'') and [[Pinus culminicola|Potos\u00ed pinyon]] (''P. culminicola''), despite being separated from them by well over {{convert|1000|km|mi}}.\n\n==Uses==\nThe edible seeds, [[pine nut]]s, are collected throughout its range, though it is much less important than [[Pinus edulis|Colorado pinyon]] (''P. edulis'') for the crop. Parry pinyon is also occasionally planted as an ornamental tree and sometimes used as a [[christmas tree]]. Due to the limited distribution of the species, the seeds of the Parry pinyon are not gathered commercially. They are more often consumed by birds, rodents and other mammals.<ref>{{cite book|last=Little|first=E.|title=The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Trees, Western Region|date=1980|edition=10|pages=288|isbn=0394507614}}</ref> The [[Cahuilla]] tribe of southern [[California]] used the [[resin]] to make a face cream commonly used by girls to prevent [[sunburn]].

It is also found as the [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''Pinus radiata'' var. ''binata'' or '''Guadalupe pine''' on Guadalupe Island, and a possibly separable ''P. radiata'' var./[[subspecies|subsp.]] ''cedrosensis'' on Cedros Island, both in the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of the northern Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.\n\nIn Australia, New Zealand, and Spain it is the leading introduced tree<ref>Scott, C. W. 1960. Pinus radiata. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Forestry and Forest Products Study 14. Rome, Italy. 328 p. cited in {{Silvics |volume=1 |genus=Pinus |species=radiata |first1=Philip M. |last1=McDonald |first2=Robert |last2=J. Laacke |accessdate=2013-09-14}}</ref> and in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Kenya, and South Africa it is a major plantation species. It is also an [[Sandy Point, Tristan da Cunha|introduced tree]] on the world's most remote inhabited island, [[Tristan da Cunha]].\n\n==Description==\n''Pinus radiata'' is a [[pinophyta|coniferous]] [[evergreen]] tree growing to between {{convert|15|-|30|m|abbr=on}} in height in the wild, but up to {{convert|60|m|abbr=on}} in cultivation in optimum conditions, with upward pointing branches and a rounded top. The [[leaf|leaves]] ('needles') are bright green, in clusters of three (two in var. ''binata''), slender, {{convert|8|-|15|cm|abbr=on}} long and with a blunt tip. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are {{convert|7|-|17|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, brown, ovoid (egg-shaped), and usually set asymmetrically on a branch, attached at an oblique angle. The [[bark]] is fissured and dark grey to brown.\n\nIt is closely related to [[bishop pine]] and [[knobcone pine]], hybridizing readily with both species; it is distinguished from the former by needles in threes (not pairs), and from both by the cones not having a sharp spine on the scales.\n\nThe modern tree is vastly different from the native tree of Monterey. In plantations the tree is commonly planted at 4m x 4m spacing on a wide variety of landscapes from flat to moderately steep hills. Because of selective breeding and more recently the extensive use of Growth Factor seedlings,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} forests planted since the 1990s are of superior wood with very straight tall trunks without the problem of twin leaders. The trees are pruned in 3 lifts so that the lower 2/3 of a mature tree is branch- ( and hence knot-) free.\nIn its natural state, the wood is poor quality: twisted, knotty and full of sap/resin only really suitable for firewood, but the modern product is very different.\n\n==Ecology==\nMonterey pine is a species adapted to cope with stand-killing fire disturbance. Its cones are serotinous, i.e. they remain closed until opened by the heat of a forest fire; the abundant seeds are then discharged to regenerate on the burned forest floor. The cones may also burst open in hot weather.<ref>[Little, Elbert L. Jr. 1980. The Audubon Society field guide to North American trees. New York: Alfred A. Knopf.]</ref>\n\nIn its native range, Monterey pine is associated with a characteristic flora and fauna. It is the co-dominant canopy tree together with ''[[Cupressus macrocarpa]]'' which naturally occurs only in coastal [[Monterey County]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=62524 |title=Monterey Cypress (''Cupressus macrocarpa'') |last1=Hogan |first1=C.

When trees begin to die of the disease, they attract bark beetles which provide a pathway for infection of other trees. In some stands, 80\u201390% of trees are infected. If the disease is introduced in agroforestry areas dependent upon Monterey pine, such as New Zealand, it could have catastrophic effects in those countries as well.<ref name=\"Gymnospermdatabase\"/>\n\n[[Sphaeropsis blight]] (''Diplodia pinea'') infects ''P.radiata'' in California and causes serious damage to plantations of the species in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa,<ref>http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/fidls/diplodia/diplodiafidl.htm</ref> especially after hail damage to growing tips.\n\n===Baja California===\nOn Guadalupe Island, var. ''binata'' is [[critically endangered]]. Most of the population was destroyed as tens of thousands of [[feral]] [[goat]]s ate ''binata'' seedlings and caused soil erosion from the mid-19th century until just a few years ago. The older trees gradually died off until by 2001\u20132002 the population stood at only one hundred. With a program to remove the goats essentially complete by 2005, hundreds of young Guadalupe pines have started to grow up in habitat fenced after 2001, the first significant new growth in about 150 years. Possible accidental introduction of pine pitch canker is considered the biggest threat at present to the survival of the Guadalupe Island pine population.<ref>Junak, S.; Keitt, B.; Tershy, B.; Croll, D. & S\u00e1nchez, J.A.

It is found in low altitude areas of the Autonomous Communities of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]], the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], and in the north of the [[Canary Islands]]. \n\nThe Monterey pine forests have a negative effect on local ecology. In its plantations there are usually no other tree species, while its shady undergrowth does not allow the existence of a rich stratum of scrub. 13% of the wood cut annually in Spain comes from this pine.<ref>[http://www.mapama.gob.es/es/desarrollo-rural/temas/politica-forestal/pradiata_tcm7-386705.pdf Los pinares de pino radiata Los pinares de pino radiata] Ministerio de Medio Ambiente. Gobierno de Espa\u00f1a.</ref>\n\n===United States===\nThe Monterey pine is widely used in private gardens and public landscapes in temperate California, and similar climates around the world. It is a fast-growing [[tree]], adaptable to a broad range of soil types and climates, though it does not tolerate temperatures below about {{convert|-15|C}}. Its fast growth makes it ideal for landscapes and forestry; in a good situation, ''P. radiata'' can reach its full height in 40 years or so.\n\n== Uses ==\nAs timber radiata is suitable for a wide variety of uses,<ref>[http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/26_5424.htm \"Radiata pine\"], Primary Industries and Fisheries, QLD</ref> and has a resinous fragrance while being worked.<ref>http://www.wood-database.com/lumber-identification/softwoods/radiata-pine/</ref> It holds screws and nails well and takes paint and stain without difficulty - and modern kiln dried timber is very easy to work.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20150126184040/http://www.nzwood.co.nz/learning-centre/radiata-pine/ \"Radiata pine\"], nzwood.co.nz</ref> It is about 1/3 heavier than dried [[western red cedar]]. It is brittle when bent, so does not have the same load-bearing features as Oregon pine ([[Douglas fir]], ''Pseudotsuga'').\n\nRadiata is used in house construction as weatherboards, posts, beams or plywood, in fencing, retaining walls, for concrete formers. It is also used to a limited extent in boat building where untreated ply is sometimes used, but must be encased in epoxy resin to exclude moisture.\n\nThe wood is normally kiln dried to 12% moisture in 6&nbsp;m long, clear lengths. It is available treated with a range of chemical salts, or untreated. Chemical salt treatment is well proven and such timber is frequently used in the ground as posts and poles as part of structures such as retaining walls and pole houses. The name applied to this treatment is tanalized wood. H1 and H2 treatment is suited to indoor use. H3 is the standard house timber and this grade is used for fence palings. H4 and H5 are the standard for inground use.

Radiata is used chipped to make particle board sheets, commonly used in flooring. Other sheet products are hardboard, softboard and ply. Most ply is structural and available in 7\u201322&nbsp;mm sizes. A small amount of higher grade ply is used to produce thinner (4 and 7&nbsp;mm) ply suitable for furniture, cabinet work and boat building. This is knot and crack free and glued with [[Resorcinol glue|resorcinol waterproof glue]]. Since the 1990s finger jointed joinery-grade wood has become available in up to 6&nbsp;m lengths in a wide range of profiles.\n\nIn 1958, New Zealand boat designer [[Des Townson]] started building 186 eleven-foot, cold-moulded [[Zephyr (dinghy)|Zephyr-class dinghies]], using ''Pinus radiata''. In 2011 these hand-built boats fetched very high prices and were generally in excellent condition.\n\nThe bark is also used as a substrate for potting and re-potting orchids.\n\n''Pinus radiata'' is the most common species of Christmas tree in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Pine bark.jpg|Detail of bark on a ''Pinus radiata'' tree\nimage:Pinus Radiata detail.jpg|Needles and spikes on a branch\nImage:Pine cone edit.jpg|''Pinus radiata'' pine cone on forest floor\nImage:Pine tree forest02.jpg|Monterey pine plantation, Australia\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*[[Point Lobos Ranch]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{IUCN2006|assessor=Conifer Specialist Group|year=1998|id=42408|title=Pinus radiata|downloaded=11 May 2006}}\n* Le\u00f3n de la Luz, Jos\u00e9 Luis; Rebman, Jon P. & Oberbauer, Thomas (2003).

It is found throughout the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and [[California Coast Ranges|Coast Ranges]] [[foothills]] that ring the [[Central Valley (California)|Central]], [[San Joaquin Valley|San Joaquin]] and interior valleys; the [[Transverse Ranges|Transverse]] and [[Peninsular Ranges]]; and [[Mojave Desert]] [[sky islands]].<ref name=\"jepTreat\" /><ref name=\"usdaTreat\" /> It is adapted to long, hot, dry summers and is found in areas with an unusually wide range of precipitation: from an average of {{convert|250|mm|0|abbr=on}} per year at the edge of the Mojave to {{convert|1780|mm|abbr=on}} in parts of the Sierra Nevada.<ref name=\"Silvics\">{{Silvics |first=Robert F. |last=Powers |volume=1 |genus=Pinus |species=sabiniana |accessdate=2016-03-17}}</ref> It prefers rocky, well drained soil, but also grows in serpentine soil and heavy, poorly drained clay soils. It commonly occurs in association with ''[[Quercus douglasii]]'',<ref>C. Michael Hogan, 2008</ref> and \"Oak/Foothill Pine vegetation\" (also known as \"Oak/Gray Pine vegetation\") is used as a description of a type of [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] characteristic within the [[California chaparral and woodlands]] [[ecoregion]] in California, providing a sparse [[overstory]] above a canopy of the [[California oak woodland|oak woodland]].\n\n== Ecology ==\n''Pinus sabiniana'' needles are the only known food of the [[caterpillar]]s of the [[Gelechiidae|Gelechiid]] [[moth]] ''[[Chionodes]] [[Chionodes sabinianus|sabinianus]]''.  Fossil evidence suggests that it has only recently become adapted to the Mediterranean climate as its closest relatives are part of the [[Madrean pine-oak woodlands]] found at higher elevations in the southwest US and Mexico.<ref>Munz, P. \"A California Flora and supplement\" University of California Press</ref> Some Indian groups relied heavily on pine nuts for food and are thought to have contributed to the current distribution pattern, including the large gap in distribution in [[Tulare County]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\n=== Common name ===\nThe name digger pine supposedly came from the observation that the [[Paiute]] foraged for its seeds by digging around the base of the tree, although it is more likely that the term was first applied to the people; \"Digger Indians\" was in common use in California literature from the 1800s. The historically more common name ''digger pine'' is still in widespread use. The [[Jepson Manual]] advises avoiding this name as the authors believe \"digger\" is pejorative in origin.<ref>Hickman, J.C. (Ed.) \"The Jepson Manual, Higher Plants of California\".

Harvesting techniques of the prehistoric Indians are still being used to today to collect the pinyon seeds for personal use or for commercialization. The pinyon nut or seed is high in fats and calories.\n\nPinyon wood, especially when burned, has a distinctive fragrance, making it a common wood to burn in [[chiminea]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chiminea Woods: Pinon, Apple, and Hickory\u2014Oh My!|url=http://www.chimineacompany.com/blogs/the-chiminea-blog/9973921-chiminea-woods-pinon-apple-and-hickory-oh-my}}</ref>  The pinyon pine trees are also known to influence the soil in which they grow by increasing concentrations of both macronutrients and micronutrients.<ref name=Barth>{{cite journal|last=Barth|first=R.C.|title=Influence of Pinyon Pine Trees on Soil Chemical and Physical Properties|journal=Soil Science Society of America Journal|date=January 1980|volume=44|issue=1|pages=112\u2013114|url=https://www.soils.org/publications/sssaj/pdfs/44/1/SS0440010112|accessdate=6 August 2012|doi=10.2136/sssaj1980.03615995004400010023x}}</ref>\n\nSome of the species are known to hybridize, the most notable ones being ''P. quadrifolia'' with ''P. monophylla'', and ''P. edulis'' with ''P. monophylla''.\n\nThe two-needle pi\u00f1on (''Pinus edulis'') is the official [[List of New Mexico state symbols#Flora|state tree]] of [[New Mexico]].\n\n== Species ==\n[[File:Pinyon pine Pinus monophylla.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|A single-leaf pinyon from Mono County, California.

The nuts continue to be gathered, eaten, and marketed.  All species of [[pine]] produce edible seeds, but in North America only pinyon produces seeds large enough to be a major source of food.<ref>\"Pi\u00f1on Nuts: The Manna of the Mountains\", ''Mother Earth News'', http://www.motherearthnews.com/real-food/pinon-nuts-zmaz77jazgoe.aspx, accessed 29 Jul 2015</ref>\n\nThe pinyon has probably been a source of food since shortly after the earliest arrival of ''Homo sapiens'' in the American southwest, 12,000 or more years ago.  In the [[Great Basin]] of the United States, archaeological evidence indicates that the range of the pinyon pine expanded northward after the [[Last glacial period|Ice Age]], reaching its northernmost (and present) limit in southern Idaho about 4,000 BCE.<ref>Simms, Steven R. (1985), \"Pine Nut Use in Three Great Basin Cases: Data, Theory, and a Fragmentary Material Record,\" ''Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology'', Vol. 7, No. 2, pp 166\u2013167. Downloaded from [[JSTOR]].</ref> Hunter/gatherer Indians undoubtedly collected the edible seeds, but, at least in some areas, the pinyon nuts were not harvested and eaten in quantity until about 600 CE. Increased use of pinyon nuts was possibly related to a population increase of humans and a decline in the number of game animals, thereby forcing the Great Basin inhabitants to seek additional sources of food.<ref>Hildebrandt, William R. and Ruby, Allika (2006), \"Prehistoric Pinyon Exploitation in the Southwestern Great Basin: A View from the Coso Range,\" ''Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology'', Vol. 26, No. 1, p. 11. Downloaded from JSTOR.</ref>\n\nThe suitability of pinyon seeds as a staple food is reduced because of the unreliability of the harvest.  Abundant crops of cones and seeds occur only every two to seven years, averaging a good crop every four years.  Years of high production of seed tend to be the same over wide areas of the pinyon range.<ref>Jeffers, Richard M., \"Pi\u00f1on PIne Seed Production, Collection, and Storage,\" United States Forest Service, http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_rm/rm_gtr258/rm_gtr258_191_197.pdf, accessed 30 July 2015</ref>\n\n== Traditional method of harvesting ==\n\nIn 1878, naturalist [[John Muir]] described the Indian method of harvesting pinyon seeds in Nevada.  In September and October, the harvesters knocked the cones off the pinyon trees with poles, stacked the cones into a pile, put brushwood on top, lit it, and lightly scorched the pinyon cones with fire.  The scorching burned off the sticky resin coating the cones and loosened the seeds.  The cones were then dried in the sun until the seeds could be easily extracted. Muir said the Indians closely watched the pinyon trees year-round and could predict the scarcity or abundance of the crop months before harvest time.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rhode, David |year=1988|title= Two Nineteenth-Century Reports of Great Basin Subsistence Practices|journal=Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology|volume=10|number= 2|pages=156\u2013157|jstor=27825342}}</ref>  In 1891, B. H. Dutcher observed the harvesting of pinyon seeds by the Panamint Indians ([[Timbisha]] people) in the [[Panamint Range]] overlooking [[Death Valley]], California.  The harvesting method was similar to the foregoing except that the pinyon seeds were extracted immediately after the cones had been scorched in the brushwood fire.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Dutcher, B. H. |date=October 1893|title=\"Pi\u00f1on Gathering among the Panamint Indians\"|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=6|number=4|pages=377\u2013380|jstor=658889|doi=10.1525/aa.1893.6.4.02a00040}}</ref>\n\nBoth the above accounts described a method of extracting the seeds from the green cones.  Another method is to leave the cones on the trees until they are dry and brown, then beat the cones with a stick, knocking the cones loose or the seeds loose from the cones which then fall to the ground where they can be collected.<ref>\"Singleleaf Pinyon\", USDA/NRCS, http://plants.usda.gov/plantguide/pdf/cs_pimo.pdf, accessed 30 Jul 2015</ref> The nomadic hunter-gathering people of the Great Basin usually consumed their pinyon seeds during the winter following harvest; the agricultural [[Pueblo people]] of the [[Rio Grande]] valley of [[New Mexico]] could store them for two or three years in underground pits.<ref>\"Indian Use of Pinyon-Juniper Woodlands\" http://mojavedesert.net/plant-use/pinyon-juniper.html, accessed 30 Jul 2015</ref>\n\nEach pinyon cone produces 10 to 30 seeds and a productive stand of pinyon trees in a good year can produce {{convert|250|lbs|kg}} on {{convert|1|acre|ha}} of land.  An average worker can collect about {{convert|22|lb|kg}} of unshelled pinyon seed in a day's work. Production per worker of 22 pounds of unshelled pinyon seeds\u2014more than one-half that in shelled seeds\u2014amounts to nearly 30,000 calories of nutrition.  That is a high yield for the effort expanded by hunter-gatherers. Moreover, the pinyon seeds are high in fat, often in short supply for hunter-gatherers.<ref>Jeffers, pp. 195\u2013196; \"Pi\u00f1on nuts, roasted (Navajo)\", http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/ethnic-foods/10473/2, accessed 30 July 2015</ref>\n\n==Relationship with wildlife==\nThe [[pinyon jay]] (''Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus'') takes its name from the tree, and pinyon nuts form an important part of its diet. It is very important for regeneration of pinyon woods, as it stores large numbers of the seeds in the ground for later use, and excess seeds not used are in an ideal position to grow into new trees. The [[Mexican jay]] is also important for the dispersal of some pinyon species, as, less often, is the [[Clark's nutcracker]]. Many other species of animal also eat pinyon nuts, without dispersing them.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Pinus classification|''Pinus'' classification]]\n* [[Pine nut]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Wikispecies-inline|Pinus subsect.

''Platanus racemosa''  is native to [[California]] and [[Baja California]], where it grows in [[riparian]] areas, [[canyon]]s, [[floodplain]]s, at [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] and [[Seep (hydrology)|seeps]], and along [[stream]]s and [[river]]s in several types of [[habitat]]s. It has been found as far north as Tehama and Humboldt counties.\n\n==Description==\nThis large tree grows to {{Convert|35|m|ft|sigfig=2}} in height with a trunk diameter of up to one meter (three feet). A specimen on the campus of [[Stanford University]] has a trunk girth (circumference) of {{Convert|10.5|m|ft|sigfig=3}}.<ref>[http://trees.stanford.edu/ENCYC/PLATrac.htm Stanford Trees, Shrubs, and Vines]</ref> The trunk generally divides into two or more large trunks splitting into many branches. The bark is an attractive patchwork of white, tawny beige, pinkish gray, and pale brown, with older bark becoming darker and peeling away. ''Platanus racemosa'' is the dominant species in the globally and state endangered sycamore-alluvial woodland habitat.\n\nThe large [[Leaf shape|palmately lobed]] [[leaves]] may be up to {{Convert|25|cm|in|sigfig=2}} centimeters wide and have three or five pointed lobes. New leaves are a bright translucent green and somewhat woolly. The [[deciduous]] tree drops copious amounts of dry golden to orangish red leaves in the fall. The [[inflorescence]] is made up of a few spherical flower heads each around a centimeter wide. The female flower heads develop into spherical fruit clusters each made up of many hairy, maroon-red-woolly [[achene]]s. \n\nThe tough and coarse-grained wood is difficult to split and work. It has various uses, including acting as a meat preparation block for [[butchers]]. Many small birds feed on its fruit, and several mammals eat its twigs and bark. The [[pollen]] and the hairs on leaves and flowers can be [[allergen]]s for some people.<ref name=cal>[http://www.californiagardens.com/Plant_Pages/platanus_racemosa.htm Californiagardens.com]</ref> New leaves are susceptible to [[Canker|anthracnose canker]], which, when it causes a side bud to become the new leader, can create picturesque angling trunks and branches on older specimens.<ref name=cal/>\n\n==Cultivation==\nIt is also widely planted horticulturally as a [[ornamental plant|landscape tree]] in public landscapes and private gardens. New appreciation for how it shades sun in summer and lets sun through in winter has led to its use in [[green architecture]] and [[sustainable design]]. The aesthetics of its bark and its overall form add interest.\n[[File:Platanus racemosa-6.jpg|thumb|''Platanus racemosa'' leaves and achenes]]\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal-inline|Gardening}}\n* [[California native plants]]\n* [[Natural landscaping]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Platanus racemosa}}\n* [http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_JM_treatment.pl?5642,5643,5644 Jepson Manual Treatment]\n* [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=PLRA USDA Plants Profile]\n* [http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?query_src=photos_index&where-taxon=Platanus+racemosa Photo gallery]\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/platanus-racemosa-california-sycamore-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map of ''Platanus racemosa'']\n\n[[Category:Flora of the California desert regions]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Sierra Nevada (U.S.)]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the California chaparral and woodlands]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the California Coast Ranges]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the Central Valley (California)]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the Channel Islands of California]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the Colorado Desert]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the Peninsular Ranges]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the Santa Monica Mountains]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the Transverse Ranges]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]\n[[Category:Platanaceae]]\n[[Category:Trees of Baja California]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mediterranean climate]]",

The [[bark]] is silvery-white, smooth or lightly fissured when young, becoming dark gray and deeply fissured on old trees. The twigs are grayish-yellow and stout, with large triangular leaf scars. The winter buds are slender, pointed, {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|in|frac=4}} long, yellowish brown, and resinous. It is one of the fastest growing trees in North America. In Mississippi River bottoms, height growth of {{convert|10|\u2013|15|ft|m|round=5}} per year for a few years have been seen.

The leaf is very coarsely toothed, the teeth are curved and gland tipped, and the petiole is flat; they are dark green in the summer and turn yellow in the fall (but many cottonwoods in dry locations drop their leaves early from the combination of drought and leaf rust, making their fall color dull or absent). Due to the flat stem of the leaf, the leaf has the tendency to shake from even the slightest breeze.

It grows at high altitudes as far south as [[Guanajuato]], Mexico.\n\nQuaking aspen grows in a wide variety of climatic conditions. January and July average temperatures range from {{convert|-30|C|F}} and {{convert|16|C|F}} in the [[Alaska Interior]] to {{convert|-3|C|F}} and {{convert|23|C|F}} in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]].

Each colony is its own clone, and all trees in the clone have identical characteristics and share a single root structure. A clone may turn color earlier or later in the fall than its neighbouring aspen clones. Fall colors are usually bright tones of yellow; in some areas, red blushes may be occasionally seen. As all trees in a given clonal colony are considered part of the same organism, one clonal colony, named [[Pando (tree)|Pando]], is considered the heaviest<ref name=\"multiple1\">Genetic Variation and the Natural History of Quaking Aspen, Jeffry B.

Even if pollinated, the small seeds (three million per pound) are only viable a short time as they lack a stored food source or a protective coating.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\">Ewing, Susan.

As this accelerated in 2004, word spread and a debate over causes began. No insect, disease, or environmental condition is yet specifically identified as a joint cause. Trees adjacent to one another are often stricken or not. In other instances, entire groves have died.\n\nMany areas of the Western US have experienced increased diebacks which are often attributed to ungulate grazing and [[wildfire suppression]]. At high altitudes where grasses can be rare, [[ungulate]]s can browse young aspen sprouts and prevent those young trees from reaching maturity. As a result, some aspen groves close to cattle or other grazing animals, such as deer or elk, have very few young trees and can be invaded by [[conifers]], which are not typically browsed. Another possible deterrent to aspen regeneration is widespread wildfire suppression.  Aspens are vigorous [[resprouter]]s and even though the above-ground portion of the organism may die in a wild-fire, the roots, which are often protected from lethal temperatures during a fire, will sprout new trees soon after a fire.  Disturbances such as fires seem to be a necessary ecological event in order for aspens to compete with conifers, which tend to replace aspen over long, disturbance-free intervals.  The current dieback in the American West may have roots in the strict fire suppression policy in the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} On the other hand, the widespread decimation of conifer forests by the [[mountain pine beetle]] may provide increased opportunities for aspen groves to proliferate under the right conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112713000352 | doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2013.01.008 | volume=299 | title=How will aspen respond to mountain pine beetle?

A conference was held in Utah in September 2006 to share notes and consider investigative methodology.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/26/science/earth/26aspen.html | work=The New York Times | first=Katie | last=Kelley | title=Emblem of the West Is Dying, and No One Can Figure Out Why | date=26 September 2006}}</ref>\n[[File:Populus tremuloides 8163.jpg|thumb|Typical yellow autumn foliage]]\n[[File:2014-10-05 14 33 30 Aspens showing autumn foliage coloration in Lamoille Canyon, Nevada.JPG|thumb|right|Atypical orange and red autumn foliage]]\n\n== Uses ==\nAspen bark contains a substance that was extracted by indigenous North Americans and European settlers of the western U.S. as a [[quinine]] substitute.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\" />\n\nLike other poplars, aspens make poor [[fuel wood]], as they dry slowly, rot quickly, and do not give off much heat. Yet they are still widely used in campgrounds because they are cheap and plentiful and not widely used in building lumber. Pioneers in the North American west used them to create [[log cabins]] and [[dugout (shelter)|dugouts]], though they were not the preferred species.\n\nThe leaves of the quaking aspen and other species in the genus ''Populus'' serve as food for [[caterpillar]]s of various moths and butterflies. See [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on poplars]].\n\nIn Canada, quaking aspen wood is used mainly for pulp products such as books, newsprint, and fine printing paper. It is especially good for panel products such as [[oriented strand board]] and [[waferboard]]. It is light in weight and is used for furniture, boxes and crates, core stock in plywood, and wall panels.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons and category-inline}}\n* {{Wikispecies-inline}}\n* [http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/poptre/all.html US Forest Service Fire Effects Information System: ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* [http://www.abtreegene.com/trees.html Alberta Forest Genetic Resources Council: ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/populus-tremuloides-quaking-aspen-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map for ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* {{ITIS |id=195773 |taxon=Populus tremuloides |accessdate=8 August 2006}}\n* Farrar, John Laird.

It is used for [[timber]], and is notable as a [[model organism]] in [[plant biology]]. Its full [[genome]] sequence was published in 2006. It is the first tree species to be sequenced.\n\n== Description ==\nIt is a large tree, growing to a height of {{convert|30|m|ft}} to {{convert|50|m|ft}} and a trunk diameter of over {{convert|2|m|ft}}, which makes it the largest [[Populus|poplar]] species in the Americas. It is normally fairly short-lived, but some trees may live for up to 400 years (Forbes 2006). A cottonwood in [[Willamette Mission State Park]] near [[Salem, Oregon]] holds the national and world records.

The bark can become hard enough to cause sparks when cut with a chainsaw.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\">Ewing, Susan. The Great Alaska Nature Factbook. Portland: Alaska Northwest Books, 1996.</ref> The stem is grey in the older parts and light brown in younger parts. The [[crown (botany)|crown]] is usually roughly conical and quite dense. In large trees the lower branches droop downwards. [[Spur shoot]]s are common. The [[wood]] has a light coloring and a straight grain.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are 7\u201320&nbsp;cm long with a glossy dark green upper side and glaucous light grey-green underside; larger leaves, up to 30&nbsp;cm long, may be produced on stump sprouts and very vigorous young trees. The leaves are alternate, elliptic with a crenate margin and an acute tip, and reticulate venation (see [[Leaf#Terminology|leaf terminology]]). The petiole is reddish. The [[bud]]s are conical, long, narrow and sticky, with a strong balsam scent in spring when they open.\n\n''Populus trichocarpa'' has an extensive and aggressive root system, which can invade and damage drainage systems. Sometimes the roots can even damage the foundations of buildings by drying out the soil.\n\n=== Reproduction ===\n'''Flowering and fruiting'''\n[[File:Black cottonwood male catkin and leaf buds.JPG|right|thumb|Male (pollen-producing) catkin and leaf buds (March 22)[[Sherwood, Oregon|Sherwood]], Oregon, USA ]]\n\n''Populus trichocarpa'' is normally [[dioecious]]; [[male]] and [[female]] [[catkin]]s are borne on separate trees. The species reaches [[flowering]] age at about 10 years. Flowers may appear in early March to late May in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]], and sometimes as late as mid-June in northern and interior [[British Columbia]], [[Idaho]], and [[Montana]]. [[Stamen|Staminate]] [[catkin]]s contain 30 to 60 [[stamen]]s, elongate to 2 to 3&nbsp;cm, and are [[deciduous]]. [[Pistillate]] [[catkin]]s at maturity are 8 to 20&nbsp;cm long with [[Ovule|rotund-ovate]], three [[carpel]]late [[subsessile fruit]]s 5 to 8&nbsp;mm long. Each capsule contains many minute [[seed]]s with long, white cottony hairs.\n\n'''Seed production and dissemination'''\n\nThe seed ripens and is disseminated by late May to late June in [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], but frequently not until mid-July in [[Idaho]] and [[Montana]]. Abundant seed crops are usually produced every year. Attached to its cotton, the seed is light and buoyant and can be transported long distances by wind and water. Although highly viable, longevity of ''P. trichocarpa'' seed under natural conditions may be as short as two weeks to a month. This can be increased with cold storage.\n\n[[File:Seeds and Fluff of Cottonwood.jpg|right|thumb|Seeds and Fluff of Cottonwood (July 1, 2012) [[Boise]], Idaho, USA]]\n\n'''Seedling development'''\n\nMoist seedbeds are essential for high germination, and seedling survival depends on continuously favorable conditions during the first month. Wet bottom lands of rivers and major streams frequently provide such conditions, particularly where bare soil has been exposed or new soil laid down. Germination is [[epigeal germination|epigeal]]. ''P. trichocarpa'' seedlings do not usually become established in abundance after [[logging]] unless special measures are taken to prepare the bare, moist seedbeds required for initial establishment. Where seedlings become established in great numbers, they thin out naturally by age five because the weaker seedlings of this shade-intolerant [[species]] are suppressed.\n\n'''[[Vegetative reproduction]]'''\n\nDue to its high levels of rooting hormones, ''P. trichocarpa'' sprouts readily. After [[logging]] operations, it sometimes regenerates naturally from rooting of partially buried fragments of branches or from stumps. Sprouting from roots also occurs. The species also has the ability to [[abscission|abscise]] shoots complete with green leaves. These shoots drop to the ground and may root where they fall or may be dispersed by water transport. In some situations, abscission may be one means of colonizing exposed [[sandbar]]s.\n\n== Distribution ==\n{{double image|right|Blackcottonwoodfull.jpg|150|blackcottonwoodtrunk.jpg|200|A large specimen in [[Diamond Ridge, Alaska]], and a close-up of the bark at the base of the trunk}}\nThe native range of ''P. trichocarpa'' covers large sections of western [[North America]]. It extends northeast from [[Kodiak Island]] along [[Cook Inlet]] to [[latitude]] 62\u00b0 30\u00b0 N., then southeast in southeast [[Alaska]] and [[British Columbia]] to the forested areas of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]], to the mountains in southern [[California]] and northern [[Baja California]] (lat. 31\u00b0 N.). It is also found inland, generally on the west side of the [[Rocky Mountains]], in [[British Columbia]], western [[Alberta]], western [[Montana]], and northern [[Idaho]]. Scattered small populations have been noted in southeastern [[Alberta]], eastern [[Montana]], western [[North Dakota]], western [[Wyoming]], [[Utah]], and [[Nevada]]. It grows up to elevations of 2100 m.\n\n''Populus trichocarpa'' has been one of the most successful introduction of trees to the otherwise almost treeless [[Faroe Islands]].\n\nThe species was imported from Alaska to [[Iceland]] in 1944 and has since become one of the most widespread trees in the country.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nIt is also grown as an [[ornamental tree]], valued for its fast growth and scented foliage in spring, detectable from over 100 m distance. The roots are however invasive, and it can damage the foundations of buildings on shrinkable clay soils if planted nearby (Mitchel 1996).\n\nBranches can be added to potted plants to stimulate rooting.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\"/>\n\n== Use as a model species ==\n''Populus trichocarpa'' has several qualities which makes it a good model species for trees:\n* Model genome size (although significantly larger than the other model plant, ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'')\n* Rapid growth (for a tree)\n* Reaches reproductive maturity 4\u20136 years\n* Economically important\n* It represents a [[phenotype|phenotypically]] diverse genus\n\nFor these reasons the species has been extensively studied. Its [[genome]] sequence was published in 2006 (see \"Genome\" below). More than 121 000 [[expressed sequence tag]]s (ESTs) have been [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] from it. The wide range of topics studied by using ''P. trichocarpa'' include the effects of [[ethylene]], [[lignin]] [[biosynthesis]], drought tolerance and [[wood]] formation.\n\n== Uses ==\n\n=== Lumber ===\n''Populus trichocarpa'' wood is light-weight and although not particularly strong, is strong for its weight. The wood material has short, fine [[cellulose]] fibres which are used in the production of high-quality book and magazine [[paper]]. The wood is also excellent for production of [[plywood]]. Living [[tree]]s are used as [[windbreak]]s.\n\n''Populus trichocarpa'' grows very quickly; trees in [[plantation]]s in Great Britain have reached {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall in 11 years, and {{convert|34|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall in 28 years (Mitchell 1996). It can reach suitable size for [[Wood pulp|pulp]] production in 10\u201315 years and about 25 years for [[timber]] production.\n\n=== Medicinal ===\nNative American tribes in the Pacific Northwest used ''P. trichocarpa'' for a variety of purposes. The inner bark was sometimes eaten but most of its uses were medicinal or practical. Because of its [[salicin]] content it was often used raw or in salves to treat a number of ailments including baldness, tuberculosis, rheumatism, and treating wounds. The wood, roots and bark were used for firewood, canoe making, rope, fish traps, baskets and structures. The gum-like sap was even used as a glue or as waterproofing.<ref name=\"Pojar\">Pojar, J. & MacKinnon, A. Plants of the Pacific Northwest Coast. Vancouver, British Columbia: Lone Pine Publishing, 2004.</ref>\n\nCommercial extracts are produced from the fragrant buds for use as a perfume in medicines and cosmetics.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\"/>\n\n'Populus trichocarpa'' contains [[salicin]], and has been used medicinally as an [[antipyretic]], [[analgesic]] and to control [[inflammation]].\n\n== Genome ==\n\n=== Characteristics ===\n* Size: 485 million [[base pair]]s. (Human genome: 3 billion base pairs)\n* Proportion of [[heterochromatin]] to [[euchromatin]]: 3:7\n* Number of [[chromosome]]s: 19\n* Number of putative genes: 45,555, the largest number of genes ever recorded (estimate in September 2008)\n* [[Mitochondrion|Mitochondrial genome]]: 803,000 [[base pair]]s, 52 [[gene]]s\n* [[Chloroplast|Chloroplast genome]]: 157,000 [[base pair]]s, 101 [[gene]]s\n\n=== General information ===\nThe sequence of ''P. trichocarpa'' is that of an individual [[female]] specimen '''\"Nisqually-1\"''', named after the [[Nisqually River]] in the [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state in the United States, where the specimen was collected. The [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] was performed at the [[Joint Genome Institute]] by using the [[shotgun sequencing|shotgun]] method. The depth of the sequencing was approximately 7.5 x (meaning that each [[base pair]] was [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] on average 7.5 times). [[Genome annotation]] was done primarily by the [[Joint Genome Institute]], the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], the [[Ume\u00e5 Plant Science Centre]] and [[Genome Canada]].\n\nPrior to the publication of ''P. trichocarpa'' [[genome]] the only available plant genomes were those of [[Arabidopsis thaliana|thale cress]] and [[rice]], both of which are [[herbaceous]]. ''P. trichocarpa'' is the first woody plant [[genome]] to be sequenced. Considering the economic importance of [[wood]] and wood products, the availability of a tree [[genome]] was necessary. The sequence also allows evolutionary comparisons and the elucidation of basic molecular differences between [[herbaceous]] and woody plants.\n\nDoty et al. (2016) found the first direct evidence of N2 fixation in the wild ''P. trichocarpa'' (a non-leguminous tree).<ref>Doty, S. L., Sher, A. W., Fleck, N. D., Khorasani, M., Bumgarner, R.

The tree, which was at least 4862 years old and possibly more than 5000, was cut down in 1964 by a graduate student and [[United States Forest Service]] personnel for research purposes.<ref name=Currey1965>{{cite journal|last=Currey|first=DR|authorlink=Donald Rusk Currey|title=An Ancient Bristlecone Pine Stand in Eastern Nevada (subscription required|journal=Ecology|volume=46|issue=4|pages=564\u20136|year=1965|jstor=1934900|doi=10.2307/1934900|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/1934900}}</ref> The people involved did not know of its world-record age before the cutting (see below), but the circumstances and decision-making process remain controversial; not all the facts are agreed upon by all involved.\n\nThe tree's name refers to the mythological figure [[Prometheus]], who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man.<ref>Aeschylus, ''[[Prometheus Bound]]''</ref> The designation WPN-114 was given by the original researcher, [[Donald Rusk Currey]], and means it was the 114th tree he sampled in his research in Nevada's [[White Pine County, Nevada|White Pine County]].\n\n==About the tree==\n [[Image:Prometheus Wheeler.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Grove (nature)|grove]] in which Prometheus grew, with the [[headwall]] of [[Wheeler Peak (Nevada)|Wheeler Peak]] in the distance]]\n\nPrometheus was a living member of a population of [[bristlecone pine]] trees near the tree line on the [[Moraine#Lateral moraines|lateral moraine]] of a former [[glacier]] on Wheeler Peak, in [[Great Basin National Park]], eastern Nevada. Wheeler Peak is the highest mountain in the [[Snake Range]], and the highest mountain entirely in the state of Nevada. The bristlecone pine population on this mountain is divided into at least two distinct sub-populations, one of which is accessible by a popular interpretive trail.\n\nPrometheus, however, grew in an area reachable only by off-trail hiking. In either 1958 or 1961, a group of [[Natural history|naturalists]] who admired Prometheus's [[Grove (nature)|grove]] gave names to a number of the largest or most distinctive trees, including Prometheus.<ref name=cohen>[http://www.terrain.org/essays/14/cohen.htm \"Oldest Living Tree Tells All\"], Michael Cohen, Terrain.org.</ref>\n\nCurrey originally estimated the tree was at least 4844&nbsp;years old. A few years later, this was increased to 4862&nbsp;by Donald Graybill of the [[University of Arizona]]'s [[Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research]]. These [[Dendrochronology|ring counts]] were done on a trunk cross-section taken about 2.5&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;feet) above the original [[germination]] point of the tree, because the innermost rings were missing below that point. Adjusting Graybill's figure by adding the estimated number of years required to reach that height, plus a correction for the estimated number of missing rings (not uncommon in trees at the tree line), it is probable that the tree was at least 5000&nbsp;years old when felled. That made it the oldest known unitary (i.e. non-[[Cloning#Horticultural|clonal]]) organism at the time, exceeding even the [[Methuselah (tree)|Methuselah tree]] of the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]]' [[Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest|Schulman Grove]], in [[California]], though Methuselah was later redated to 4845 years old.<ref name=\"rmtrr.org\">[http://www.rmtrr.org/oldlist.htm Rocky Mountain Tree Ring Research, OldList database of ancient trees]</ref>\n\nIn 2012 a bristlecone pine in California's White Mountains was measured by Tom Harlan to be 5062 years old,<ref name=\"rmtrr.org\"/> making it the oldest known tree in North America and the oldest known individual tree in the world.\n\nWhether Prometheus should have been considered the oldest organism ever known depends on the definition of \"oldest\" and \"[[organism]]\". Certain sprouting (clonal) organisms, such as [[Larrea tridentata|creosote bush]] or [[aspen]], may have older individuals if the entire clonal organism is considered.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSL1190625120080411 Swedish spruce may be world's oldest living tree|Science|Reuters]</ref> By that standard, the oldest living organism is a grove of [[Populus tremuloides|quaking aspens]] in [[Utah]] known as [[Pando (tree)|Pando]], at perhaps as much as 80,000&nbsp;years old. In a clonal organism, however, the individual clonal [[Plant stem|stems]] are not nearly so old, and no part of the organism is particularly old at any given time. Until 2012, Prometheus was thus the oldest ''non-clonal'' organism yet discovered, with its innermost, extant rings exceeding 4862&nbsp;years of age.\n\n==Cutting of the tree==\n[[Image:Prometheus tree1.jpg|thumb|The cut stump of the Prometheus tree]]\n\nIn the 1950s [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronologists]] were making active efforts to find the oldest living tree species in order to use the analysis of the rings for various research purposes, such as the evaluation of former climates, the dating of archaeological ruins, and addressing the basic scientific question of maximum potential lifespan. Bristlecone pines in California's White Mountains and elsewhere were discovered by [[Edmund Schulman]] to be older than any species yet discovered. This spurred interest in finding very old bristlecones, possibly older than the [[Methuselah tree]], aged by Schulman in 1957 at over 4700 years.\n\n[[Donald R. Currey]] was a graduate student at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] studying the climate dynamics of the [[Little Ice Age]] using [[dendrochronology]] techniques. In 1963 he became aware of the bristlecone populations in the Snake Range in general, and on Wheeler Peak in particular. Based on the trees' size, growth rate and growth forms, he became convinced that some were very old, [[Core sample|cored]] some of them, and found trees exceeding 3,000 years in age, but Currey was not able to obtain a continuous series of overlapping cores from WPN-114.\n\nHere, stories diverge. It is not clear whether Currey requested, or Forest Service personnel suggested, that he cut down and section the tree in lieu of coring it. There is also some uncertainty as to why a core sample could not be obtained. One version has it that he broke or lodged his only long increment borer and could not obtain another before the end of the field season;<ref name=Radiolab>\"[http://www.radiolab.org/2010/jun/28/be-careful-what-you-plan-for/ Be Careful What You Plan For]\", ''[[Radiolab]],'' June 28, 2010.</ref> another claims he broke two of them, while another implies that a core sample was too difficult to obtain and also would not provide as much definitive information as a full cross-section of the tree.<ref name=hall>\"[http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Staying-Alive-High-in-California-s-White-2995266.php Staying Alive]\", Carl Hall, ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', August 23, 1998.</ref>\n\nIn addition, there are conflicting views of Prometheus's uniqueness in the Wheeler Peak grove. It is reported that Currey and/or the Forest Service personnel who authorized the cutting believed the tree was just one of many large, very old trees in the grove. Others, at least one of whom was involved in the decision-making and tree cutting, believe that the tree was clearly unique&nbsp;\u2014 obviously older than other trees in the area.\n\nAt least one person involved says that Currey knew that to be true at the time, although there is no known admission from Currey that he did, and others have disputed that the tree, based on observation alone, was obviously much older than the others.<ref name=cohen/><ref name=hall/>\n\nAnother uncertainty is that it is not clear why the felling of such an old tree was necessary given what Currey was studying. Since the [[Little Ice Age]] started no more than 600 years ago, many trees could presumably have provided the information he was seeking for that time period. In Currey's original report in the journal ''Ecology'' (Currey, 1965), however, he refers to the Little Ice Age as encompassing the period from 2000 BC to the present, thus defining the Age over a much longer time period than is currently accepted. Whether this was a common view at the time is not known. In the article, Currey indicates that he sectioned the tree as much to determine whether the oldest bristlecones were necessarily confined to California's White Mountains (as some dendrochronologists had been claiming) as from its usefulness in regard to studies of the Little Ice Age.<ref name=hall/>\n\nWhatever the rationale, the tree was cut down and sectioned in August 1964, and several pieces of the sections were hauled out to be processed and analyzed, first by Currey, then by others in later years. Sections or pieces of sections have ended up in various places, some of them publicly accessible, including the [[Great Basin National Park]] visitor center ([[Baker, Nevada]]), the Ely Convention Center ([[Ely, Nevada]]), the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research ([[Tucson, Arizona]]), and the U.S. Forest Service's [[Institute of Forest Genetics]] ([[Placerville, California]]).\n\n==Repercussions==\nIt has been argued that the cutting down of Prometheus was an important factor in the movement to protect bristlecones in general, and the Wheeler Peak groves in particular.<ref>\"[http://www.sonic.net/bristlecone/Martyr.html The Martyred One]\", Leonard Miller, The Bristlecone Site.</ref> There had been a movement to protect the mountain and contiguous areas as a national park before the incident, and 22 years later the area gained national park status.\n\n==Contemporary references==\nIn August 2014, marking the fiftieth anniversary of the tree's cutting, a two-day memorial for Prometheus was held in [[Great Basin National Park]] by artist Jeff Weiss.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/la-et-cam-c1-prometheus-jeff-weiss-20150227-story.html#page=1 THE GHOST OF PROMETHEUS: A LONG-GONE TREE AND THE ARTIST WHO RESURRECTED ITS MEMORY]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[King Clone]]\n* [[Lomatia tasmanica|King's Lomatia]]\n* [[Llangernyw Yew]]\n* [[Old Tjikko]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|url=http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2010/09/03/segments/156565|title=Radiolab|publisher=WNYC|date=2010-09-03}}.\n* Hitch, Charles J. 1982.

It is a [[legume]] adapted to a dry, [[desert]] climate.  Though considered to be a [[Noxious weeds|noxious weed]] in states outside its natural range, it plays a vital role in the ecology of the [[Sonoran Desert]].\n\n==Distribution==\nVelvet mesquite is native to the [[Sonoran Desert|Sonoran]], [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]], and [[Chihuahuan Desert|Chihuahuan]] Deserts.  It grows at elevations below 4,000 to 5,000 feet in desert [[grassland]]s and near [[Arroyo (creek)|washes]].  The main distribution is in central and southern [[Arizona]] and in adjacent [[Sonora]], Mexico.  Near waterways, mesquites can form deciduous woodlands called [[bosque]]s.<ref name=\"fs\">\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/provel/all.html\n|title=Prosopis velutina\n|publisher=www.fs.fed.us\n|accessdate=2008-05-01\n|last=\n|first=\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Prosopis velutina Anza-Borrego.jpg|thumb|Blossoming ''P. velutina'' in [[Anza-Borrego Desert State Park]]]]\nVelvet mesquite can grow to 30\u201350&nbsp;ft (9\u201315 m) tall or more.  It grows larger in areas with ample water, smaller in open, dry [[grassland]]s.  The youngest branches may be green and [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]].<ref>Turner, Raymond M. 1963. Growth in four species of Sonoran Desert trees.  Ecology. 44: 760-765.</ref>  Young bark is reddish-brown and smooth.  As it matures, it becomes a dark, dusty gray or brown and takes on a shredded texture.  Yellow thorns up to one inch long appear on the young branches.  The [[Leaf|leaves]] are about 3-6 in (7.5\u201315&nbsp;cm) long, fine, and [[Pinnate|bipinnately compound]].  They fold closed at night.  \n[[Image:Mesquite-leaves-fold.jpg|thumb|700px|center|Composite image of velvet mesquite leaves folding up in the evening in response to decreasing light levels]]\n\nThe [[taproot]] sinks deep into the earth, far deeper than the height of the tree, taking advantage of water sources inaccessible to most plants.

Because of its deep [[root]] system, it keeps its leaves in the dry months of summer in all but the most severe [[drought]] years.  The [[flower]]s are yellow and form in the spring (after the leaves) in dense cylindrical clusters ([[catkin]]s) roughly {{convert|4|in|cm|abbr=on}} long.  Long seedpods ([[legume]]s) form from the flowers.  They are bright green and look somewhat like pea pods when young. Mature, dry pods are hard and contain several hard, dry, brown [[seed]]s.  The seeds need to be [[Scarification (botany)|scarified]] before they can [[Germination|germinate]].  This scarification typically takes place in the digestive tracts of animals, which eat the seeds and then [[Seed dispersal|disperse]] them widely, as the seed takes days to pass through the animal.<ref>Fisher, C.

[[Coyote]]s, [[Round-tailed Ground Squirrel|round-tailed ground squirrel]]s, [[Collared Peccary|collared peccaries]], [[mule deer]], [[white-tailed deer]], and [[Hare|jackrabbits]] all eat mesquite pods, as do livestock when they are available.<ref name=\"fs\" /> [[Bird]]s feed on the flower buds.  As a member of the legume family, mesquites [[Nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] in the [[soil]].  Mesquites can serve as [[nurse tree]]s to young [[Cactus|cacti]], such as the [[saguaro]]. The shade of its branches provides protection for small [[mammal]]s, especially burrowing animals.  Native Americans used the seeds for food, grinding them into a [[flour]].  The [[bark]] was used for baskets and fabrics and the wood for [[firewood]] and building.  The leaves and [[Natural gum|gum]] were used as [[Herbalism|medicine]].\n\n[[Image:Ground squirrel mesquite.jpg|thumb|right|A round-tailed ground squirrel eating velvet mesquite pods]]\n\nThe range of the velvet mesquite has changed because of grazing.  [[Cattle]] not only [[Seed dispersal|dispersed]] mesquite seeds, but they also [[Overgrazing|overgrazed]] the land, resulting in fewer [[Wildfire|range fires]] to control the mesquite population.  Mesquites grew more densely and spread into what had been grassland.<ref name=\"fs\" />  Consequently, velvet mesquite is considered an [[invasive species]] or noxious weed in several states.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://plants.usda.gov/java/nameSearch?keywordquery=prosopis+velutina\n|title=PLANTS Profile for Prosopis velutina (velvet mesquite) | work=USDA PLANTS\n|accessdate=2008-05-01\n|last=\n|first=\n}}\n</ref>  However, mesquite [[bosque]]s cover only a small fraction of the area they covered before human settlement.

Stomachaches were treated with a tea made from the fresh leaves.  Toothache was treated by chewing the soft inner bark of the root.  For flagging appetite, a tea made from the dried leaves was taken before meals.<ref>Felger, R. S. and M. B. Moser, 1985,  ''People of the Desert and Sea.'' University of Arizona Press, Tucson, AZ.</ref>\n* Cosmetic uses: Most important to a select number of folks was mesquite's use against hair loss.   This treatment was used by men only, and consisted of the black sap that oozes from mesquite wounds (not the clear sap) mixed with other secret herbs and applied to the scalp.  Special mesquite herbal soap for \"macho\" hair is still available in parts of Mexico.<ref>Diaz, J. L.  1976.  ''Usos de las Plantas Medicinales de Mexico''.

Pods are considered a slow-release food due to [[galactomannin]] gums which have been found to lower [[glycemic]] responses.  Their glycemic index is 25%, compared to 60% for sweet corn, and 100% for white sugar.\n\nDried and toasted, the pods are ground into mesquite meal and mesquite flour.

The growth form is straight, with a conical crown from {{convert|12|\u2013|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} broad, and a strong and spreading root system. The [[bark]] is deeply ridged, composed of thin, woodlike plates separating heavy layers of cork; bark of trees over {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter is from {{convert|15|\u2013|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick. The main branches are long and spreading with pendulous side shoots.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, {{convert|2.5|\u2013|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, are shed when about 5 years old. The female [[Conifer cone|cones]] are from {{convert|10|\u2013|18|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, larger and with thicker scales than those of other [[douglas-fir]]s, and with exserted tridentine bracts. The [[seed]]s are large and heavy, 10&nbsp;mm long and 8&nbsp;mm broad, with a short rounded wing 12&nbsp;mm long; they may be [[bird]] or [[mammal]] dispersed as the wing is too small to be effective for wind dispersal. Trees start producing seeds at about 20 years of age.\n\nThe largest known individual of this species is {{convert|53|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, {{convert|231|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and is estimated to be from 600 to 700 years of age.\n\n==Distribution==\n''Pseudotsuga macrocarpa'' is restricted to the [[California montane chaparral and woodlands]] and [[California coastal sage and chaparral]] ecoregions of [[California]]. It prefers a [[Mediterranean climate]], characterized by hot dry summers and wet, mild winters. Annual rainfall during a 30-year period on a bigcone Douglas-fir site in the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] averaged {{convert|75|cm|in|abbr=on}} and ranged from {{convert|25|\u2013|125|cm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\nBigcone Douglas-fir occurs between {{convert|300|-|2,700|m|ft|abbr=on}}. At low elevation, it occurs near streams in moist, shaded canyons and draws where aspects are mostly north and east. At elevations from {{convert|1,350|-|1,700|m|ft|abbr=on}}, aspects include south- and east-facing slopes. At these elevations, it also grows on sloping hillsides, ridges, and benches. At higher [[elevation]]s, it occurs on south and west aspects on all types of terrain. The average angle of [[slope]] on which it grows is 35 degrees, ranging from level to 90 degrees, although these extremes are uncommon.\n\nRanges the tree is found in, south to north, include:<ref>[http://www.calflora.org/entry/observ.html#srch=t&taxon=Pseudotsuga+macrocarpa&lpcli=t&cc=LAX&cch=t&inat=r Calflora: Los Angeles County distribution map]</ref><ref>[http://www.calflora.org/entry/observ.html#srch=t&taxon=Pseudotsuga+macrocarpa&lpcli=t&cc=VEN&cch=t&inat=r Calflora: Ventura County distribution map]</ref>\n*[[Peninsular Ranges]]\n**[[Cuyamaca Mountains]]\n**[[Palomar Mountains]]\n**[[Santa Ana Mountains]]\n**[[San Jacinto Mountains]]\n*[[Transverse Ranges]]\n**[[San Bernardino Mountains]]\n**[[San Gabriel Mountains]]\n**[[Santa Susana Mountains]]\n**[[San Emigdio Mountains]]\n**[[Topatopa Mountains]]\n**[[Santa Ynez Mountains]]\n**[[San Rafael Mountains]]\n**[[Sierra Madre Mountains (California)|Sierra Madre Mountains]]\n\n[[Image:Pseudotsuga macrocarpa cone.jpg|thumb|left|Bigcone Douglas-fir cone (left), with a\n[[Coast Douglas-fir]] cone for comparison]]\n\n==Ecology==\n''Pseudotsuga macrocarpa'', has several features to tolerate and survive [[wildfire]], notably the very thick bark, and the presence of numerous adventitious buds on the upper side of the branches; this enables the trees to survive even crown fires which burn off all the branchlets, the apparently dead trees becoming green again the following spring. Wildfire frequencies in the [[chaparral]] habitats in which it often grows typically range from 15-50 year intervals. Bigcone Douglas-fir is closely associated with canyon live oak (''Quercus chrysolepis'') and often establishes itself in its shade; after about 50 years, it emerges above the oak canopy.\n\n[[File:Pseudotsuga macrocarpa LytleCreek2.jpg|thumb|right|''Pseudotsuga macrocarpa'' showing branch regeneration after a crown fire through [[epicormic shoots]]. Note the charred tree trunks.]]\n\nThe number of plant associates in bigcone Douglas-fir communities is usually small. \n* Common overstory associates include:  [[bigleaf maple]] (''Acer macrophyllum''), [[Umbellularia californica|California bay laurel]] (''Umbellularia californica''), [[gray pine]] (''Pinus sabineana''), and [[white alder (plant)|white alder]] (''Alnus rhombifolia''). \n* [[Shrub]] associates include [[Ceanothus megacarpus|bigpod ceanothus]] (''Ceanothus megacarpus''), [[Adenostoma sparsifolium|red shank]] (''Adenostoma sparsifolium''), [[Arctostaphylos glandulosa|eastwood manzanita]] (''Arctostaphylos glandulosa''), [[toyon]] (''Heteromoles arbutifolia''), several species of [[Salvia|sage]] (''Salvia''), and [[Quercus dumosa|coastal sage scrub oak]] (''Quercus dumosa'').\n* Ground cover associates are usually sparse, and may include [[Eriogonum fasciculatum|California buckwheat]] (''Eriogonum fasciculatum''), wild onion (''Allium'' spp.), [[Penstemon|scarlet beardtongue]] (''Penstemon ternatus''), [[giant chain fern]] (''Woodwardia fimbriata''), and [[bracken|western bracken]] (''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]'' var. ''pubescens'').\n\n===Fire ecology===\n{{See also|Fire ecology}}\n''Pseudotsuga macrocarpa'' populations are suspected to be declining due to possibly larger and more extreme [[wildfire|wildland fires]] with greater frequencies. Major wildfires within its range, since 2003, have clearly proven a reduced extent when compared to early 1930s extents derived from historical aerial photos. Although historical information has provided the opportunity to detect stand level patch changes, post-fire resprouting of older more mature trees and natural regeneration and recruitment of the species into higher canopy has yet to be adequately quantified.\n\nOne tree species in direct competition with bigcone is ''[[Calocedrus decurrens]]'', with preliminary post-fire regeneration of this species exponentially greater than bigcone. After 1 or 2 years after the Station fire in 2009 on the Angeles National Forest, there was an estimated 20:1 cedar:bigcone seedling density in fixed radius plots on Mount Wilson. It may be more appropriate to perform population stability estimates up to 5 yrs or much later (i.e. 20 yrs) after a large conflagration due to the potential for immediate and delayed post-fire sprouting and regeneration and interplant competition, as well as the well-noted strategy of seed germination in shrub understories, which is likely to escape detection by surveyors until much later in its life.\n\nResearch related to the role of mychorizae and its relationship to seed establishment needs evaluated in these vegetation communities due to the suspected role it has with the relationship with water, especially in water-limited systems such as those in the wildlands of southern California. In addition, an aggressive seed cone collection strategy should be drafted for this species which includes extensive collection during large cone production years such as 2013, and should include a tracking system to determine correlations to climatic conditions in order to develop a foundation from which to perform species viability assessments w/ varying future climate scenarios.\n\nThis tree is being considered for more extensive plantings in semiarid locales. Its favorable qualities include resistance to drought, fire, [[insect]]s, decay, and damage from [[ozone]], and its aggressive rooting system and tolerance to variable growing medium. The needles of older trees sometimes fade to yellow, drop, and trees appear dead only to sprout with renewed vigor within 2 years. The reason is unknown, although drought or insects may be possible causes.\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Wildlife===\nBigcone Douglas-fir stands provide habitat for [[black-tailed deer]], [[American black bear|black bear]], and various small animals. These trees provide preferred spring habitat for black bear in the [[San Bernardino Mountains]].\n\nThe seeds are eaten by various rodents and birds.\n\n===Restoration species===\nBigcone Douglas-fir is used for [[Drainage area|watershed]] and [[habitat restoration]]. The Los Angeles County Department of Forestry has extensively planted the tree over a 50-year period for that purpose.\n\nSome [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s of ''Pseudotsuga macrocarpa'' (bigcone Douglas-fir) \u00d7 ''[[Pseudotsuga menziesii]]'' (Douglas-fir) show promise for planting on drier restoration sites within the ''P. menziesii''\u2212Douglas-fir natural range. These hybrids produce wood of comparable quality to that of Douglas-fir and have the drought tolerance of bigcone Douglas-fir.\n\n===Timber===\nThere is no current commercial market for bigcone Douglas-fir wood due to limited distribution and access. It is heavy, hard, and fine grained but not durable. There is less sapwood than heartwood, and the latter contains pockets of [[resin]].\n\nIn the past, the wood was used locally for fuel and [[lumber]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[California mixed evergreen forest]] \u2014 ''ecoregion''.\n*[[California chaparral and woodlands]] \u2014 ''ecoregion''.\n**[[California montane chaparral and woodlands]] \u2014 ''subecoregion''.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* [http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/psemac/index.html US Forest Service Fire Effects Database]\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category|Pseudotsuga macrocarpa|<br/>Pseudotsuga macrocarpa|position=left}}\n*[http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-taxon=Pseudotsuga+macrocarpa Calflora Database: ''Pseudotsuga macrocarpa'' (bigcone Douglas fir, bigcone spruce)]\n* [http://www.conifers.org/pi/ps/macrocarpa.htm Conifers.org, Gymnosperm Database: ''Pseudotsuga macrocarpa'']\n* [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/silvics_manual/Volume_1/pseudotsuga/macrocarpa.htm USFS Silvics Manual: Bigcone Douglas-Fir]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pseudotsuga Macrocarpa}}\n[[Category:Pseudotsuga|macrocarpa]]\n[[Category:Endemic flora of California]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the California chaparral and woodlands]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the Peninsular Ranges]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the Transverse Ranges]]\n[[Category:San Gabriel Mountains|~]]\n[[Category:San Jacinto Mountains|~]]\n[[Category:San Bernardino Mountains|~]]\n[[Category:Santa Susana Mountains|~]]\n[[Category:Angeles National Forest|~]]\n[[Category:Cleveland National Forest|~]]\n[[Category:Los Padres National Forest|~]]\n[[Category:San Bernardino National Forest|~]]\n[[Category:Near threatened flora of California]]",

It commonly lives more than 500 years and occasionally more than 1,200 years. The [[bark]] on young trees is thin, smooth, gray, and covered with resin blisters. On mature trees, it is moderately thick (3\u20136&nbsp;cm), furrowed and corky though much less so than coast Douglas-fir.\n\n[[File:2013-07-14 09 27 54 Douglas fir foliage along Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive in Great Basin National Park, Nevada.jpg|thumb|left|Foliage]]\nThe shoots are brown to gray-brown, smooth, though not as smooth as [[fir]] shoots, and finely pubescent with scattered short hairs. The [[bud]]s are a distinctive narrow conic shape, 3\u20136&nbsp;mm long, with red-brown bud scales. The leaves are spirally arranged but slightly twisted at the base to be upswept above the shoot, needle-like, 2\u20133&nbsp;cm long, gray-green to blue-green above with a single broad [[stomata]]l patch, and with two whitish stomatal bands below.\n\nThe male ([[pollen]]) cones are 2\u20133&nbsp;cm long, and are typically restricted to or more abundant on lower branches. Pollen cones develop over 1 year and wind-dispersed pollen is released for several weeks in the spring.\n\n[[Image:Pseudotsuga glauca cones.jpg|right|thumb|thumb|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir cones<br/>Left: [[Shuswap Lake]], [[British Columbia]], Canada<br/>Right: [[Chiricahua Mountains]], [[Arizona]], U.S.]]\n\nThe mature female [[Conifer cone|seed cones]] are pendent, 4\u20137&nbsp;cm long, 2&nbsp;cm broad when closed, opening to 3\u20134&nbsp;cm broad. They are produced in spring, purple (sometimes green) at first, maturing orange-brown in the autumn 5\u20137 months later. The seeds are 5\u20136&nbsp;mm long and 3\u20134&nbsp;mm broad, with a 12\u201315&nbsp;mm wing. Both coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir produce abundant crops of seed approximately every 2\u201311&nbsp;years. Seed is produced annually except for about 1 year in any 4-to-5-year period.\n\n==Growth==\n[[File:Pseudotsuga menziesii Thompson-Nicola BC.jpg|thumb|right|Douglas-fir, British Columbia]]\n\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir grows more slowly than coast Douglas-fir and is also much more cold tolerant. Tolerance of different environmental conditions varies among populations of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, especially among populations from the northern and southern Rockies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=J.|author2=Marshall, J.D. |author3=Jaquish, B.C. |title=Genetic differentiation in carbon isotope discrimination and gas exchange in ''Pseudotsuga menziesii''|journal=Oecologia|year=1993|volume=93|issue=1|pages=80\u201387|doi=10.1007/BF00321195|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p0m37l5717103783/}}</ref>  However, even nearby populations can differ in cold hardiness.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rehfeldt|first=G.E.|title=Ecological adaptations in Douglas-Fir (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var.

The most prominent lateral roots begin in the 1st or 2nd year of growth. Most roots in surface soil are \"long ropelike laterals of secondary and tertiary origin\". Fine-root production is episodic in response to changing environmental conditions; the average lifespan of fine roots is usually between several days and several weeks.\n\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir reaches reproductive maturity at 12\u201315 years. It has winged seeds that are dispersed primarily by wind and [[gravity]]. In western [[Montana]] clearcuts, seeds were dispersed up to {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} uphill from their source, but seedfall between {{convert|180|\u2013|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} was only 7% of that found in uncut stands. Other studies determined that seedfall in [[clearcutting|clearcuts]] beyond {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on}} from seed trees was about 3% of seedfall in uncut stands where seed trees are close together. Well-stocked stands have resulted from seedfall from sources {{convert|1|\u2013|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} distant, but most Douglas-fir seeds fall within {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of their source. Small amounts of seed are dispersed by mice, [[chipmunk]]s, and [[squirrel]]s. Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir seeds are disseminated about twice as far as seeds of [[ponderosa pine]].\n\n==Longevity==\nThe oldest accurately-dated Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, 1275 years old, is in [[New Mexico]]. This longevity is apparently uncommon; growing on a relatively barren lava field has protected it from fire, animals, and humans. Growth typically slows dramatically between 90 and 140 years of age.\n\nIn the dry-belt forests of central [[British Columbia]], ages can exceed 500 years on sites normal for the region. The oldest accurately-dated growth ring available for the region is 1475; dates in the 1500s and 1600s are more common for remnant patches that have escaped logging, fire, and other disturbances.\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:USA 10638 Bryce Canyon Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine, [[Bryce Canyon National Park]], Utah]]\n\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir grows on a variety of sites across its wide geographic range. It grows at lower elevations adjacent to and within [[bunchgrass]] communities and is also found in upper-elevation subalpine forests. It tends to be most abundant in low- and middle-elevation forests, where it grows over a wide range of aspects, slopes, landforms, and soils.\n\nIn spring and winter (in British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana) [[elk]] browse on south- and southwest-facing Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands, particularly when shrubs and/or grasses are productive. In summer, elk generally are found at higher elevations (outside the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and Pacific ponderosa pine zones). During fall, elk use stands of Rocky Mountain [[lodgepole pine]], [[subalpine fir]], [[western larch]], or [[grand fir]] with high canopy cover.\n\nIn parts of [[Yellowstone National Park]], elk browsing is so intensive that young Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir are stunted at {{convert|1|\u2013|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height, with live branches trailing very close to the ground, and branches on the upper two thirds of the tree dead. Low-elevation and south-facing open-structure Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir types are often important winter range for [[white-tailed deer]] and [[mule deer]]. [[Moose]] winter in low-elevation Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir types in areas where willow thickets, the preferred winter habitat, are lacking; in such areas Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is an important moose food.\n\n[[Chipmunk]]s, [[mouse|mice]], [[vole]]s, and [[shrew]]s eat large quantities of conifer seeds from the forest floor, and clipped cones are a staple and major part of storage of red squirrels. These animals store a large amount of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir cones or seeds. [[American marten]] commonly den in hollow logs.\n\nNumerous species of [[songbird]]s extract seeds from Douglas-fir cones or forage for seeds on the ground. The most common are the [[Clark's nutcracker]], [[black-capped chickadee]], [[mountain chickadee]], [[boreal chickadee]], [[red-breasted nuthatch]], [[pygmy nuthatch]], [[red crossbill]], [[Two-barred crossbill|white-winged crossbill]], [[dark-eyed junco]], and [[pine siskin]]. Migrating flocks of dark-eyed juncos may consume vast quantities of seeds and freshly germinated seedlings. [[Woodpecker]]s commonly feed in the bark of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. [[Blue grouse]] forage on needles and buds in winter; they and other birds rely heavily on Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir communities for cover.\n\nThe Douglas-fir is vulnerable to infestation by a [[Eriosomatidae|woolly]] [[aphid]], ''[[Gall Adelgid|Adelges cooleyi]]'' that also infects the [[Engelmann spruce]] to complete its [[Gall Adelgid#Life cycle|lifecycle]].\n\n==Uses==\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir is a valuable timber tree. The wood is exceptionally strong and is used for structural timber as well as poles, [[plywood]], pulp, dimensional [[lumber]], railroad ties, mine timbers, log cabins, posts and poles, fencing, and firewood. Other uses listed include \"machine-stress-rated lumber\", glued-laminated (Glulam) beams, pallets, furniture, cabinets, doors, flooring, window frames, and other miscellaneous woodwork and [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]]. Rocky Mountain Douglas-firs are also cut and sold as Christmas trees.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Commons|Pseudotsuga_menziesii#Pseudotsuga_menziesii_var._glauca|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=PSMEG USDA Plant Profile: ''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var.

The [[bud]]s are a very distinctive narrow conic shape, {{convert|4|\u2013|8|mm|abbr=on}} long, with red-brown bud scales.

The male ([[pollen]]) cones are {{convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|abbr=on}} long, dispersing yellow pollen in spring.<ref name=FEIS/>\n\nIn [[forest]] conditions, old individuals typically have a narrow, cylindric crown beginning {{convert|20|-|40|m|ft}} above a branch-free trunk. Self-pruning is generally slow and trees retain their lower limbs for a long period. Young, open-grown trees typically have branches down to near ground level. It often takes 70\u201380 years for the trunk to be clear to a height of {{convert|5|m|ft}} and 100 years to be clear to a height of {{convert|10|m|ft}}.<ref name=FEIS/>\n\nAppreciable seed production begins at 20\u201330 years in open-grown coast Douglas-fir. Seed production is irregular; over a 5-7 year period, stands usually produce one heavy crop, a few light or medium crops, and one crop failure. Even during heavy seed crop years, only about 25 percent of trees in closed stands produce an appreciable number of cones. Each cone contains around 25 to 50 seeds. Seed size varies; average number of cleaned seeds varies from 70-88/g (32,000-40,000 per pound). Seeds from the northern portion of coast Douglas-fir's range tend to be larger than seed from the south.\n\n==Ecology==\n[[Image:Pseudotsuga menziesii 01221.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[snag (ecology)|snag]] provides nest cavities for birds]]\nThe [[root]]ing habit of coast Douglas-fir is not particularly deep, with the roots tending to be shallower than those of same-aged Ponderosa pine, sugar pine, or California incense-cedar, though deeper than Sitka spruce. Some roots are commonly found in organic soil layers or near the mineral soil surface. However, Douglas-fir exhibits considerable morphological plasticity, and on drier sites coast Douglas-fir will generate deeper taproots.<ref name=FEIS/>\n\nDouglas-fir [[snag (ecology)|snag]]s are abundant in forests older than 100\u2013150 years and provide cavity-nesting habitat for numerous forest birds.<ref name=FEIS/> Mature or \"old-growth\" Douglas-fir forest is the primary habitat of the [[red tree vole]] (''Arborimus longicaudus'') and the [[spotted owl]] (''Strix occidentalis''). Home range requirements for breeding pairs of spotted owls are at least 400 ha ({{convert|4|km2|acre}} of old-growth. Red tree voles may also be found in immature forests if Douglas-fir is a significant component. This animal nests almost exclusively in the foliage of Douglas-fir trees. Nests are located {{convert|2|-|50|m|ft}} above the ground. The red tree vole's diet consists chiefly of common{{Verify source|date=April 2010}}<!-- was \"Coastal\", but does the vole only occur along the coast? The text's use of the nondescript \"foliage of Douglas-fir trees\" does not suggest so. --> Douglas-fir needles. A [[parasitic plant]] sometimes utilizing ''P. menziesii'' is [[Arceuthobium douglasii]] Commonly known as Douglas-fir dwarf mistletoe.\n\nIts seedlings are not a preferred browse of [[black-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus columbianus'') and [[elk]] (''Cervus canadensis''), but can be an important food source for these animals during the winter when other preferred forages are lacking. In many areas, coast Douglas-fir needles are a staple in the spring diet of [[blue grouse]] (''Dendragapus''). In the winter, [[New World porcupine]]s primarily eat the inner bark of young conifers, among which they prefer Douglas-fir.<ref name=FEIS/>\n\nDouglas-fir seeds are an extremely important food for small mammals. Mice, voles, shrews, and chipmunks consumed an estimated 65 percent of a Douglas-fir seed crop following dispersal in western Oregon. The [[Douglas squirrel]] (''Tamiasciurus douglasii'') harvests and caches great quantities of Douglas-fir cones for later use. They also eat mature pollen cones, developing inner bark, terminal shoots, and tender young needles. The seeds are also important in the diets of several seed-eating birds. These include most importantly [[American sparrows]] (Emberizidae) &ndash; [[dark-eyed junco]] (''Junco hyemalis''), [[song sparrow]] (''Melospiza melodia''), [[golden-crowned sparrow]] (''Zonotrichia atricapilla'') and [[white-crowned sparrow]] (''Z. leucophrys'') &ndash; and [[true finch]]es (Fringillidae) &ndash; [[pine siskin]] (''Carduelis pinus''), [[purple finch]] (''\"Carpodacus\" purpureus''), and the Douglas-fir [[red crossbill]] (''Loxia curvirostra neogaea'') which is uniquely adapted to foraging for ''P. menziesii'' seeds.<ref name=FEIS/>\n\nThe coast Douglas-fir variety is the dominant tree west of the Cascade Mountains in the [[Pacific Northwest]], occurring in nearly all forest types, competes well on most parent materials, aspects, and slopes. Adapted to a moist, mild climate, it grows larger and faster than [[Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir]]. Associated trees include [[western hemlock]], [[Sitka spruce]], [[sugar pine]], [[western white pine]], [[Ponderosa pine]], [[grand fir]], [[coast redwood]], [[western redcedar]], [[Incense-cedar|California incense-cedar]], [[Chamaecyparis lawsoniana|Lawson's cypress]], [[tanoak]], [[bigleaf maple]] and several others. Pure stands are also common, particularly north of the [[Umpqua River]] in Oregon.\n\n[[Shrub]] associates in the central and northern part of Coast Douglas-fir's range include [[vine maple]] (''Acer circinatum''), [[salal]] (''Gaultheria shallon''), Pacific [[rhododendron]] (''Rhododendron macrophyllum''), [[Oregon-grape]] (''Mahonia aquifolium''), [[red huckleberry]] (''Vaccinium parvifolium''), and [[salmonberry]] (''Rubus spectabilis''). In the drier, southern portion of its range shrub associates include [[Beaked Hazel|California hazel]] (''Corylus cornuta'' var. ''californica''), [[oceanspray]] (''Holodiscus discolor''), [[Snowberry|creeping snowberry]] (''Symphoricarpos mollis''), western poison-oak (''[[Toxicodendron diversilobum]]''), [[ceanothus]] (''Ceanothus'' spp.), and [[manzanita]] (''Arctospaphylos'' spp.). In wet coastal forests, nearly every surface of old-growth coast Douglas-fir is covered by [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s.\n\n==Forest succession==\n[[File:Red Creek Fir.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Red Creek Fir, ca.15 km from [[Port Renfrew]], BC, measures 43.7ft around its base and stretches 242 ft high]]\nThe shade-intolerance of Douglas-fir plays a large role in the forest [[Ecological succession|succession]] of lowland old growth rainforest communities of the Pacific Northwest. While mature stands of lowland old-growth rainforest contain many western hemlock (''Tsuga heterophylla'') seedlings, and some [[western redcedar]] (''Thuja plicata'') seedlings, Douglas-fir dominated stands contain almost no Douglas-fir seedlings. This seeming contradiction occurs because Douglas-firs are intolerant of deep shade and rarely survive for long within the shaded understory. When a tree dies in a mature [[forest]] the canopy opens up and sunlight becomes available as a source of energy for new growth. The shade-tolerant Western Hemlock seedlings that sprout beneath the canopy have a head-start on other seedlings. This competitive advantage allows the [[western hemlock]] to grow rapidly into the sunlight, while other [[seedling]]s still struggle to emerge from the soil. The boughs of the growing western hemlock limit the sunlight for smaller trees and severely limit the chances of shade-intolerant trees, such as the Douglas-fir. Over the course of centuries, western hemlock typically come to dominate the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] of an old-growth lowland rainforest.\n\nDouglas-firs are seral trees in temperate rainforest, and possess thicker bark and a somewhat faster growth rate than most other climax trees of the area, such as the western hemlock and western redcedar. This quality often gives Douglas-firs a competitive advantage when the forest experiences a major disturbance such as fire. Periodically, portions of a [[Pacific Northwest]] lowland forest may be burned by wildfire, may be logged, or may be blown down by a wind-storm. These types of disturbances allow Douglas-fir to regenerate in openings, and low-intensity fires often leave Douglas-fir trees standing on drier sites, while less drought- and fire-tolerant species are unable to get established.\n\n[[Conifer]]s dominate the climax forests of the coast Douglas-fir. All of the climax conifers that grow alongside Douglas-fir can live for centuries, with a few species capable of living for over a millennium. Forests that exist on this time scale experience the type of sporadic disturbances that allow mature stands of Douglas-fir to establish themselves as a persistent element within a mature old-growth [[forest]]. When [[old growth forest]]s survive in a natural state, they often look like a patchwork quilt of different forest communities. Western hemlock typically dominate oldgrowth rainforests, but contain sections of Douglas-firs, redcedar, [[alder]], and even [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] forests on their southern extent, near the Oregon and California border, while [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]] increases in frequency with latitude.\n\nThe logging practices of the last 200 years created artificial disturbances that caused Douglas-firs to thrive. The Douglas-fir's useful wood and its quick growth make it the crop of choice for many timber companies, which typically replant a clear-cut area with Douglas-fir seedlings. The high-light conditions that exist within a clear-cut also naturally favor the regeneration of Douglas-fir. Because of clear-cut logging, almost all the Pacific Northwest forests not strictly set aside for protection are today dominated by Douglas-fir, while the normally dominant climax species, such as western hemlock and western redcedar are less common. On drier sites in California, where Douglas-fir behaves as a climax species in the absence of fire, the Douglas-fir has become somewhat invasive following fire suppression practices of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries; it is becoming a dominant species in many [[oak]] [[California oak woodland|woodlands]], in which it was previously a minor component.<ref>C.

Nicklas Str\u00f5mberg]</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nCoast Douglas-fir is one of the world's best timber producers and yields more timber than any other tree in North America. The wood is used for dimensional lumber, timbers, pilings, and [[plywood]]. [[Creosote]] treated pilings and decking are used in marine structures. The wood is also made into railroad ties, mine timbers, house logs, posts and poles, flooring, pulp, and furniture. Coast Douglas-fir is used extensively in landscaping. It is planted as a specimen tree or in mass screenings. It is also a popular [[Christmas tree]].<ref name=FEIS/>\n\n==Largest trees==\n[[File:Coast Douglas-fir in Vancouver 1887.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Coast Douglas-fir in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], 1887)]]\n* The tallest tree in the [[United Kingdom]] is a coast Douglas-fir.

Map 131, ''Quercus arizonica''.</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Arizona white oak is one of the largest southwestern oaks. This tree may grow up to 60&nbsp;ft (18 meters) with a trunk diameter of 3.3&nbsp;ft (1 meter). It also contains fat branches and a spreading crown along with thick leaves. The thick leaves are about 3.2&nbsp;inches (13&nbsp;mm) long and evergreen. It grows very slowly once it has become mature, approximately 0.1&nbsp;inches per year in diameter.<ref name=jill/>\n\n* Bark: The color is light grayish. The bark is initially thin and lenticeled but later the bark becomes quite thick with shallow fissures and scaly ridges.<ref name=jill/>\n* Twig: Are medium sized. Colors can be light brown, fuzzy; reddish brown. Twigs also have pointy and fat clusters of terminal buds.<ref name=jill/>\n* Leaves: They are alternate, evergreen, simple, and oblong. The color is yellowish green or blueish green. Leaves are usually 1{{frac|1|2}} to 3{{frac|1|2}}&nbsp;inches long and they are usually entire or toothed margin. The texture of the leaves are leathery and stiff. The veins are parallel veins that are sunken above and raised beneath. The leaves also have round shaped base. The leaves may begin to shed in late winter or when new leaves begin emerging during spring.<ref name=jill/>\n* Fruits: Oblong acorn that is 1/2 to 1&nbsp;inch long. Acorns also caps that is shaped like a bowl that takes up 1/3 of the nut. The acorns usually mature around fall. The amount of acorns produced can also vary year to year, one year there may be about 32,000 acorns and the next year there may be very few. The germination of acorns is highly correlated with the amount of moisture during the rainy season.<ref name=jill/>\n* Flowers: They are monoecious, meaning that male and female organs are in different flowers on the same tree. Female flowers have small spike in the axils of the leaves. Males flowers are found in long drooping catkins that are yellowish green color.<ref name=jill>[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233501008 Flora of North America, ''Quercus arizonica'' Sargent, 1895.  Arizona oak ]</ref><ref>[http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/34567435#page/106/mode/1up Sargent, Charles Sprague 1895. Garden & Forest 8: 92-93]</ref>\n\n== Cultivation ==\nThe Arizona white oak can be found in a vast array of habitats such as savannas, grasslands, and chaparrals. They are usually found in mountain like areas that are above about 1675&nbsp;meters in elevation. Water use is low and it requires sun or part shade. Soil moisture must be dry and it must be rocky or sandy soils. Soils may be clay loam, clay, medium loam, or rocky. The Arizona white oak is both heat and cold tolerant.\n\n== Response to fires ==\n[[File:Quercus arizonica leaves 2.jpg|thumb|right|Underside of leaves]]\n\nWhen Arizona white oaks are small they usually die by fire. The acorns are usually killed by fires as well. The foliage is extremely flammable but larger trees usually survive fires that are not as severe and if a stump survives a fire it will sprout rapidly after its survival.\n\n== Threats ==\nThe wood decaying fungus ''[[Inonotus andersoni]]'' affects the Arizona white oak negatively. Burning and herbicide treatment has also affected the growth of the Arizona white oak, so they are being managed by pinyon-juniper silvicultural systems.\n\n== Uses ==\nThe wood is usually used for fuel. Since the wood of the Arizona white oak is hard, heavy, and strong, it is rarely used for commercial reasons such as furniture production.\n\nThe Arizona white oak is very important to livestock and wildlife because the acorns it produces provide food for cattle and other wildlife. It also provides cover for such animals like deer, turkeys, [[javelinas]], desert sheep, songbirds, and quail. The white tailed deer is also known to utilize it for cover. For white-tailed and mule deer, the Arizona white oak is highly palatable as well.\n\nThe Arizona white oak can also be used as an ornamental plant.\n\n{{commons}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n* [[Linden Oak]], possibly the largest living white oak in the United States\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/queari/all.html Pavek, Diane S. 1994.

This tree is often found near [[stream|creeks]] and drainage [[Swale (geographical feature)|swales]] growing in moist cool [[habitat (ecology)|microhabitats]]. Its [[leaf|leaves]] are a glossy dark green on the upper surface with prominent spines; a further rapid identification arises from the leaves of canyon live oak being geometrically flat.

The elliptical to oblong leaves are 2.5 to 8.0 centimeters (1.0-3.2 inches) in length with widths of about half that dimension; moreover, leaves are short-pointed at the tip, but rounded or blunt at base. Although the leaves appear generally flat, they may have edge margins slightly turned under, typically with spiny teeth, particularly on young twigs. These leathery leaves are a glossy dark green above, with a nether surface a dull golden down,<ref>Bruce M. Pavlik, Pamela C.

Lateral roots and woody rhizomes are widespread near the soil surface. Ninety percent or more of shinnery oak's biomass is under ground, and fortuitous root grafting is common. These underground stems commonly spread to form plants 3 to 15 m or more in diameter.  Single clones are reported to cover up to 81 ha and to achieve ages over 13,000 years.<ref name=Peterson/>\n\n'''Flowers:'''  Shinnery oak is monoecious with both female and male flowers borne separately on the same plant.<ref name=Flora/>  Male [[catkins]] are densely flowered, 1.5-3.8&nbsp;cm long, and hang downward. Female catkins are 3\u20137&nbsp;mm long, contain 1 to 5 flowers, and are usually axillary on young shoots.  Shinnery oaks are wind pollinated, and flowering occurs in the spring.\n\n'''Acorns:''' Acorns develop in 1 year, maturing in the autumn.  Acorns occur alone or in clusters of 2 or 3, and are 12\u201325&nbsp;mm long by 14\u201318&nbsp;mm wide. A scaly cup covers about 1/3 to 1/2 of the nut.  On average, acorn crops are produced in 3 out of 10 years.<ref name=Gucker/>\n\n'''Foliage:'''  The leathery, highly variable leaves are grey green to olive green, have a lustrous upper surface, and are whitish and densely hairy below.   Leaves are [[Leaf#Arrangement on the stem|alternate]], [[Leaf#Divisions of the lamina (blade)|simple]], with variable [[Leaf shape|shape]] (oblong, ovate, or elliptical), and with wavy or shallowly lobed margins.  Length is 2 to 8&nbsp;cm and width 2 to 4&nbsp;cm.<ref name=OK/>\n\n'''Twigs:'''  Twigs are brown or grayish, 1-2.5&nbsp;mm diameter, glabrous or densely covered with short grayish or yellowish hairs, that are lost with age. Buds are dark red-brown, somewhat spherical, about 2&nbsp;mm long, and sparsely pubescent.\n\n'''Bark:'''  Bark on the larger stems is light gray and scaly.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nShinnery oak populations in Utah and Arizona are considered a variety of shinnery oak ([[Quercus havardii var. tuckeri|''Quercus havardii'' var. ''tuckeri'']]) by some taxonomists.  However, [[introgression]] of shinnery oak with Gambel oak (''[[Quercus gambelii]]'') and perhaps shrub live oak (''[[Quercus turbinella]]'') make taxonomic identification of these populations difficult.<ref name=Gucker/>\n\nShinnery oak hybridizes with Mohr oak (''[[Quercus mohriana]]'') and post oak (''[[Quercus stellata]]''). Post oak \u00d7 shinnery oak hybrids are likely to be a result of post oak's historic range, which extended more westerly than it does today. Mohr oak \u00d7 shinnery oak hybrids are restricted to habitats intermediate to those occupied by the two species. Mohr oak inhabits limestone soils, and shinnery oak occurs on deep sand soils.\n\n==Native range==\nShinnery oak is native to western [[Oklahoma]], west [[Texas]], eastern [[New Mexico]], and 2 isolated populations in southwest [[Kansas]].<ref name=KANU>[http://www.nhm.ku.edu/herbarium/ R.L. McGregor Herbarium. ''Quercus havardii Rydb.'' herbarium records]</ref> A variety also occurs in northeastern [[Arizona]] and southeastern [[Utah]].<ref>[http://www.efloras.org/object_page.aspx?object_id=6796&flora_id=1 Flora of North America. Quercus havardii: Range Map.]</ref> Sandy plains, sand dunes, and sand hills of the southern Great Plains are typical habitat.\n\n==Management==\nA majority of shinnery oak occurs on private land used for agriculture and/or livestock production. It is considered undesirable on grazing lands, because it competes with better livestock forage and its buds and leaves are toxic to cattle for several weeks in spring. In addition, where cotton is grown near shinnery oak, [[Boll Weevil|boll weevils]] overwinter in the oak litter and infest nearby cotton fields in spring.  Thus, most research and other human effort concerning shinnery oak have been devoted to its eradication.\n\nThe use of chemical and mechanical control methods has been extensive, making it likely that shinnery oak's distribution is decreasing.  Most authorities do not recommend complete eradication of shinnery oak, indicating that forage production is typically greater if some shinnery oak remains in the community.  Stocking rates and rotational grazing patterns exist that reduce the incidence of shinnery oak poisoning of cattle.  Excessive control of shinnery oak is controversial because it can open sandy soils to wind erosion and can conflict with wildlife-habitat quality.<ref name=Peterson/>\n\nShinnery oak sprouts prolifically from rhizomes soon after fire.  Researchers described the communities as \"extremely fire hardy\".<ref name=Gucker/>\n\n[[File:Quercus havardii resprouting.jpg|thumb|Quercus havardii resprouting]]\n\n==Uses==\nBecause shinnery oak thrives in a harsh environment, it functions as a sand dune stabilizer, protecting sandy soils from wind erosion.   It also provides diverse wildlife species cover and food. [[Collared peccaries]], [[lesser prairie-chicken]]s, [[northern bobwhite]]s, and many other wildlife species eat shinnery oak acorns.  [[White-tailed deer|Deer]], [[pronghorn]], and [[packrat|southern plains woodrat]]s browse shinnery oak.  Shinnery oak habitats are used by [[black-tailed jackrabbit]]s, [[desert cottontail]]s, [[eastern cottontail]]s, [[wild turkey]]s, [[western box turtle]]s, a diversity of arthropods, approximately 25 [[snake]] species, and approximately 10 [[lizard]] species, including the endangered sand dune lizard (''[[Sceloporus arenicolus]]'').<ref name=Peterson/>\n\nMany game species also rely on shinnery oak.  [[Scaled quail]] and northern bobwhites use shinnery oak habitats extensively, and shinnery oak habitats are considered \"the principal home for white-tailed deer in the southern Great Plains\".<ref name=Peterson/>\n\nShinnery oak provides rich habitat for wildlife compared with the surrounding [[Shortgrass prairie|shortgrass plains]].  Maintaining wildlife habitat and improving vegetation for livestock grazing are often in conflict, and should be carefully considered before undertaking control of shinnery oak.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Quercus havardii}}\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=QUHA3 USDA Plants Profile for ''Quercus havardii'' \u2014 Havard oak.]\n\n[[Category:Quercus|havardii]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Plains-Midwest (United States)]]\n[[Category:Endemic flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]",

It is most abundant in rich deep soils of valley floors below 600 meters (2000 feet) in elevation. Valley oak is found in dense [[riparian]] forests, open [[foothill woodland]]s and valley [[savanna]]s. Commonly associated trees are [[coast live oak]], [[interior live oak]], [[blue oak]], [[black walnut]], [[California sycamore]] and [[gray pine]].<ref name=j>Griffin, J. R., & Critchfield, W. B. (1972). The Distribution of Forest Trees in California. Berkeley: Pacific Southwest Forest Station and Range Experiment Station, United States Department of Agriculture</ref>\n\nThe valley oak is widely distributed in: the California [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]; many smaller valleys such as the [[San Fernando Valley]] (original Spanish place-name from [[California oak woodland|oak savannah]]), [[Conejo Valley]], and [[Santa Ynez Valley]]; the [[Inner Coast Ranges]] south of the [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]]; and the [[Transverse Ranges]] from the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] to the [[Simi Hills]], [[Santa Susana Mountains]]. It is also present on [[Santa Cruz Island]] and [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Some of the most picturesque stands are found in [[Sonoma Valley]], Round Valley in [[Mendocino County]] and the southern [[Salinas Valley]] near the up-river reaches of the [[Salinas River (California)|Salinas River]].<ref name=h/><ref name=j/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nValley oak is of the [[white oak]] [[evolution]]ary lineage, which is officially known as the [[subgenus]] ''Lepidobalanus''. This subgenus comprises numerous oaks from California and elsewhere, which species share similar leaves, acorns, bark and [[wood pulp]]. Early [[History of California before 1900|settlers]] used a variety of common names for the valley oak including: white oak, bottom oak, swamp oak, water oak and mush oak. The [[Spaniard]]s, because the tree looked like the white oaks in Europe, called the tree \"roble\".\n\n[[Image:Quercus lobata leaves Caswell Memorial State Park San Joaquin Valley California.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Leaves of ''Quercus lobata'']]\n\n==Historical accounts==\nIn 1792, the English explorer [[George Vancouver]] noted on his expedition through the [[Santa Clara Valley]], after seeing an expanse of valley oaks: \"For about twenty miles it could only be compared to a park which had originally been closely planted with the true old English oak; the underwood, that had probably attended its early growth, had the appearance of having been cleared away and left the stately lords of the forest in complete possession of the soil which was covered with luxuriant foliage.\"<ref name=z>Balls, E. K. (1972). ''Early Uses of California Plants'', University of California Press, Berkeley</ref>\n\nIn the year 1861, [[William Henry Brewer]], the chief [[botanist]] for the first [[California Geological Survey]] wrote of the valley oaks that he saw in [[Monterey County]]: \"First I passed through a wild canyon, then over hills covered with oats, with here and there trees--oaks and pines. Some of these oaks were noble ones indeed. How I wish one stood in our yard at home....I measured one [valley oak] with wide spreading and cragged branches, that was 26.5 feet in circumference.  Another had a diameter of over six feet, and the branches spread over 75 feet each way. I lay beneath its shade a little while before going on.\"<ref name=z/>\n\nThe [[Hooker Oak]] of [[Chico, California]], was once considered the largest known valley oak. When it fell on May 1, 1977, it was nearly a hundred feet tall (30 m) and 29 feet (8.8 m) in circumference eight feet (2.4 m) from the ground.\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Commercial wood interest===\nDifficulties in acquiring valley oak wood as well as issues stemming from its drying such as cracking and warping have shifted its consumption from a general purpose lumber to a primarily niche product.<ref name=USDA/> Valley oak wood has a small, but significant market for use in cabinetry though, and is also suitable for hardwood flooring.<ref name=USDA/> [[Tylose]]s present in the pores of valley oak wood increases its impermeability to fluids allowing it to be used in the production of water-tight vessels.<ref name=USDA/> Such vessels include wine barrels where valley oak wood sees limited role in the composition of and where it has similar properties to other [[List of Quercus species#Section Quercus|white oaks]] such as a reduced tannin load compared to the [[List of Quercus species#Section Lobatae|red oaks]] and an open grain that allows for an increased transfer of oxygen.<ref name=USDA/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n* [[California oak woodland]]\n* [[List of Quercus species]]\n* [[California chaparral and woodlands]]\n* [[California native plants]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons}}\n*[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_JM_treatment.pl?4316,4326,4346 Jepson Manual Treatment \u2014 ''Quercus lobata'']\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=qulo United States Department of Agriculture Plants Profile for ''Quercus lobata'' (valley oak)]\n*[http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?query_src=photos_index&where-taxon=Quercus+lobata ''Quercus lobata'' \u2014 CalPhoto gallery, University of California]\n\n[[Category:Quercus|lobata]]\n[[Category:Endemic flora of California]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the California chaparral and woodlands]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the California Coast Ranges]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the Central Valley (California)]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the Channel Islands of California]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the Santa Monica Mountains]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the Transverse Ranges]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mediterranean climate]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1801]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Drought-tolerant trees]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

The leaf arrangement is alternate.\n\nIts [[inflorescences]] which occur at the ends of branches consist of small, 5-petaled, flowers that appear to be pink, but upon closer examination actually have white to pink [[petals]] with red [[sepals]]. Additionally, the [[flowers]] may be either bisexual or pistillate. The fruit is a reddish, sticky [[drupe]], and is small, about 6 \u2013 8&nbsp;mm in [[diameter]].\n\n==Ecology==\nThe fruit and flowers are also popular with birds and butterflies and the plant itself provides good [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] for birds.\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Cultivation===\n''Rhus ovata'' prefers well-drained soil in a sunny location, with little water once established, being a very drought-tolerant plant. It does not respond to formal boxed pruning well; however, as needed for wildfire fuel reduction or rejuvenation, occasional autumnal cutting, down to above the base crown, is done for new basal sprouting.\n\n===Fruit===\nThe fruit of ''Rhus ovata'' can be used to make a drink similar to [[lemonade]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[California chaparral and woodlands]] - (''ecoregion'')\n*[[California coastal sage and chaparral ecoregion|California coastal sage and chaparral]]  - subecoregion\n*[[Coastal sage scrub]] - (''plant association'')\t\n*[[California montane chaparral and woodlands]]  - subecoregion\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2017}}\n*Saunders, Charles Francis.

It also occurs in scattered, isolated locales of [[Durango]], [[Sinaloa]], and in the northeast at [[Nuevo Leon]] and [[Tamaulipas]]: also extreme southern [[Baja California Sur]], (west of Sinaloa-Durango across the [[Gulf of California]]).<ref name=Little-183/> Besides parts of the Sierra Madre Occidental, locales occur in the southern [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] cordillera, but also small isolated locales as far northeast as the northeast states.\n\nIts range is similar to that of the Bonpland willow, ''[[Salix bonplandiana]]'', except ''S. bonplandiana'' covers almost the entire north-south extent of the Sierra Madre Occidentals; yewleaf is more intermittent in that range.\n\n===Similar ranges of ''S. taxifolia'', ''S. bonplandiana''===\nBoth ''S. taxifolia'', and ''[[Salix bonplandiana|S. bonpandiana]]'' have identical ranges: both species range from the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] southward, on an imaginary centerline into central [[Guatemala]]. Each is on the Pacific Coast, but leave the [[wildlife corridor|coastal strip]] before the range into central Guatemala. Both have their [[disjunct distribution|disjunct]] ranges in Arizona, both being in the [[Madrean Sky Islands]] region.

''S. taxifolia'' occurs ''west'' of the Occidental cordillera in the south Pacific Coast north to southern [[Sinaloa]]&ndash;southwest Durango. ''B. bonplandiana'' has a few locales on the [[Mexican Plateau]], (with both occurring in central [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], west of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua]]).<ref name=Little-166/> Other minor locale differences occur in central [[New Mexico]], far west [[Texas]], [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo Leon]], and [[Tamaulipas]].\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Salix taxifolia}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=SATA Lady Bird Johnson database]\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=SATA NRCS: USDA Plants Profile]\n\n[[Category:Salix|taxifolia]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Northwestern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Southern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Baja California Sur]]\n[[Category:Trees of Chiapas]]\n[[Category:Trees of Chihuahua (state)]]\n[[Category:Trees of Durango]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nayarit]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]\n[[Category:Trees of Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puebla]]\n[[Category:Trees of Sinaloa]]\n[[Category:Trees of Sonora]]\n[[Category:Trees of Tamaulipas]]\n[[Category:Trees of Veracruz]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:North American desert flora]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Chihuahuan Desert]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of Arizona]]\n[[Category:Flora of Sonora]]\n[[Category:Flora of New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Flora of Chihuahua (state)]]\n[[Category:Flora of Texas]]\n[[Category:Flora of Durango]]\n[[Category:Flora of Sinaloa]]\n[[Category:Flora of Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]\n[[Category:Flora of Tamaulipas]]\n[[Category:Flora of Baja California Sur]]",

(6.1&nbsp;m) in height in the western part of its range. Solitary trees though can grow as tall as 50&nbsp;ft. (15.2&nbsp;m) in height. In the western part of its range it is most often found growing at the head of prairie ravines, the margins of woodlands, the edges of fields or on rocky hillsides.\n\nThe leaves of the soapberry are alternate, pinnately compound, thick and leathery but deciduous, 8&nbsp;in. (20&nbsp;cm) to 15&nbsp;in. (38&nbsp;cm) in length, made up of 6 to 20 narrow lanceolate leaflets with smooth margins, long tapered tips, and uneven wedge-shaped bases which are 2&nbsp;in. to 5&nbsp;in. (5&nbsp;cm to 13&nbsp;cm) long and .75&nbsp;in. to 1.5&nbsp;in. (2&nbsp;cm to &nbsp;cm) wide. Midveins on leaves of var. ''saponaria'' are mostly winged, while those of var. ''drummondii'' are never winged.\n\nThe inflorescence are dense terminal panicles of small white flowers 6&nbsp;in. to 10&nbsp;in (15&nbsp;cm to 20&nbsp;cm) long. Flowering occurs in May\u2013June for var. ''drummondii'' and in November for var. ''saponaria''.\n\nThe fruit occur in large pyramidal clusters at the ends of branches. Each golden colored fruit is between 1.2&nbsp;in. to 1.4&nbsp;in. (3&nbsp;cm to 3.6&nbsp;cm) in diameter and becomes translucent and wrinkled when fully mature and contains a single black seed about .35&nbsp;in (9&nbsp;mm) in diameter. Fruits of var. ''drummondii'' ripen in October and often remain on the tree until spring, while those of var. ''saponaria'' ripen in spring.\n\nThe twigs of var. ''drummondii'' are gray-brown and hairy with short tan colored hairs while those of var. ''saponaria'' are gray and hairless. Buds on var. ''drummondii'' are small dark brown and hairy while those on var. ''saponaria'' are small brown and hairless.\n\nThe trunk of var.

(Note: \"cat's claw\" is also used to refer to ''[[Uncaria tomentosa]]'', a woody vine found in the tropical jungles of South and Central America)\n\nThe [[Botanical name|specific epithet]] ''greggii'' refers to [[Josiah Gregg]], author, explorer, and amateur naturalist of the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] and northern Mexico.\n\n==Ecology==\n''Senegalia greggii'' is most common in [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] where its roots have access to deep water. Its seeds require physical [[Scarification (botany)|scarification]] in order to germinate. This effectively prevents [[germination]] unless a [[flash flood]] disturbs the area and deposits enough water to increase the likelihood that seedlings will be able to establish deep enough roots to survive the dry season. Catclaw is fully [[drought]] [[deciduous]] and will usually lack [[Leaf|leaves]] for most of the year. ''S. greggii'' has [[Extrafloral nectary|extrafloral nectaries]], a trait shared with other senegalias. A tentative connection has been made between these glands and [[insect]]s that would suggest a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship (as found in other ''Senegalia'' species).  [[Ant]]s are known to use the glands as a source of food and water, and may provide some defense for the plant against [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] insects. Like other arroyo trees in family [[Fabaceae]], ''S. greggii'' is frequently afflicted with Desert Mistletoe, ''[[Phoradendron]] [[Phoradendron californicum|californicum]]''. Unlike other legumes, ''S. greggii'' is not known to form [[root nodule]] associations with [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[Diazotroph|bacteria]].\n\nIt is argued that this species may be an example of an evolutionary [[anachronism]], in which the range and renewal of the species is limited due to the [[Quaternary extinction event#The Pleistocene or Ice Age extinction event|extinction]] of the mammalian [[megafauna]] responsible for [[Endozoochory|seed dispersal]]. Within this model, the scarification required to germinate the seeds would have occurred during the chewing and [[digestion]] of the fruit by a large [[mammal]], who later passes the seed intact some distance from the original tree.\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Acacia greggii1.jpg|thumb|200px|<div style=\"text-align:center;\">''Senegalia greggii''</div>]]\nIt is a large [[shrub]] or small [[tree]] growing to {{convert|10|-|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall with a trunk up to {{convert|20|-|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter. The grey-green [[leaf|leaves]] are [[deciduous]], and bipinnate, divided into 1-3 pairs of pinnae, each pinna {{convert|2|-|3|cm|abbr=on}} long with 10-18 [[leaflet (botany)|leaflets]] that are {{convert|3|-|6|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Pinnae are most frequently in two pairs, with the proximal pair perpendicular to the petiolule and the distal pair forming a V at the tip.  \n\nThe blooms are produced in dense cylindrical spikes of numerous flowers, each individual flower with five cream colored {{convert|3|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[petal]]s and numerous creamy yellow {{convert|6|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[stamen]]s. The [[fruit]] is a flat, twisted [[legume]] (pod) {{convert|6|-|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, containing generally 3 to 5 hard, flattened, medium brown [[seed]]s.  The seed pod is constricted between seeds (a [[loment]]), and [[seed dispersal]] occurs both through [[Dehiscence (botany)|dehiscence]] and breaks at these constrictions.\n\n==Ethnobotany==\n''Senegalia greggii'', even though it is used as [[Fodder|forage]] for livestock, contains a potentially poisonous [[cyanogenic glycoside]] called [[prunasin]].<ref>[http://www.ivis.org/special_books/Knight/chap1/ivis.pdf Plants Causing Sudden Death by A. P. Knight and R. G. Walter]</ref>  Mature seeds are to be avoided, as the native people did. ''S. greggii'' young, unripe beans were gathered and eaten by desert [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|tribes]] of [[North America]], including the [[Chemehuevi]] of the [[Southern Paiute]], the [[Pima people|Pima]], and the [[Cahuilla]]. The Cahuilla also ground the dried beans for mush and cakes, while the [[Havasupai]] ground it to make flour for bread. The [[Seri people|Seri]] ground the beans to meal then mixed it with water and sea lion oil for [[porridge]]. The [[Diegueno]] used ''S. greggii'' as food for domesticated animals. \n\nThe Cahuilla and Pima used the fibers for sturdy construction material and firewood. The Havasupai split the twigs and used them for [[basketry]], but also used the twigs as a broom to brush off [[metate|metates]]. The O'odham (formerly called [[Tohono O'odham|Papago]]) used the broken twigs for baskets, and were curved to make intricate weaves in the baskets. The Pima used the dried bushes to pile them to make a brush fence. The branches were used to make cradle frames as well. \n\nThe Tohono O'odham fitted the branches around deer hunters' heads to make a disguise, and the buds and blossoms were dried to make perfume sachets by the women. The sticks were also used to dislodge [[saguaro]] fruits from the [[cactus]] body, and rods were curved to flesh animal skins. The Akimel O'odham made bows out of the wood.<ref name=\"U Michigan Native American Ethnobotany\">{{cite web|title=Acacia greggii Gray|url=http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl|website=http://herb.umd.umich.edu/|accessdate=2015}}</ref>\n[[Image:Acacia-greggii-flower.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Senegalia greggii'' Flower]]\n\n==Some chemical compounds found in ''Senegalia greggii''==\n*[[Beta-methyl-phenethylamine]]<ref name=\"chem\">[http://uvalde.tamu.edu/pdf/chemtdaf.pdf Chemistry of Acacias from South Texas]</ref>\n*[[Catechin]]<ref name=\"chem\"/>\n*[[Fisetin]]<ref name=\"chem\"/>\n*[[Hordenine]]<ref name=\"chem\"/>\n*[[Phenethylamine]]<ref name=\"chem\"/>\n*[[Quercetin]]<ref name=\"chem\"/>\n*[[Tyramine]]<ref name=\"chem\"/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Acacia greggii branch.jpg|<center>''Senegalia greggii'' branch</center>\nImage:Acacia greggii seeds.jpg|<center>''Senegalia greggii'' seeds</center>\nImage:Acacia greggii2.jpg|<center>Catclaw Acacia thorn</center>\nImage:Acacia-greggii-bark.jpg|<center>Bark</center>\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===General references===\n* Barlow, C.

Molecular studies have shown the three to be each other's closest relatives, generally with the redwood and giant sequoia (''[[Sequoiadendron giganteum]]'') as each other's closest relatives. However, Yang and colleagues in 2010 queried the polyploid state of the redwood and speculate that it may have arisen as an ancient hybrid between ancestors of the giant sequoia and dawn redwood (''[[Metasequoia]]''). Using two different single copy [[nuclear gene]]s, [[Leafy|LFY]] and [[NLY]], to generate [[phylogenetic tree]]s, they found that ''Sequoia'' was clustered with ''Metasequoia'' in the tree generated using the LFY gene, but with ''Sequoiadendron ''in the tree generated with the NLY gene. Further analysis strongly supported the hypothesis that ''Sequoia'' was the result of a [[hybridization event]] involving ''Metasequoia'' and ''Sequoiadendron''. Thus, Yang and colleagues hypothesize that the inconsistent relationships among ''Metasequoia'', ''Sequoia,'' and ''Sequoiadendron'' could be a sign of [[reticulate evolution]] (in which two species hybridize and give rise to a third) among the three genera. However, the long evolutionary history of the three genera (the earliest fossil remains being from the [[Jurassic]]) make resolving the specifics of when and how ''Sequoia'' originated once and for all a difficult matter\u2014especially since it in part depends on an incomplete fossil record.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|title = Three Genome-based Phylogeny of Cupressaceae s.l: Further Evidence for the Evolution of Gymnosperms and Southern Hemisphere Biogeography|year = 2012|last = Yang|first = Z.Y.|last2 = Ran|first2 = J.H.|last3 = Wang|first3 = X.Q.|journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume = 64|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2012.05.004|pages=452\u2013470|pmid=22609823}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Coast redwood bark.jpg|thumb|left|Bark detail]]\n\nThe coast redwood can reach {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall with a trunk diameter of {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Flora of North America\">{{cite web|url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=200005399|title=Sequoia sempervirens (D.

Cool coastal air and [[fog drip]] keep this forest consistently damp year round. Several factors, including the heavy rainfall, create a soil with fewer nutrients than the trees need, causing them to depend heavily on the entire biotic community of the forest, especially complete recycling of the trees when dead. This forest community includes [[coast Douglas fir]], [[Pacific madrone]], [[tanoak]], [[western hemlock]], and other trees, along with a wide variety of [[fern]]s, [[moss]]es, [[fungus|mushrooms]], and [[redwood sorrel]].

[[Old-growth]] redwood stands provide habitat for the federally threatened [[spotted owl]] and the California-endangered [[marbled murrelet]].\n\nCoast redwoods are resistant to insect attack, fungal infection, and rot.

Seed production begins at 10\u201315 years of age. The trees produce flowers in the winter which later mature into cones by fall. Coast redwoods produce many cones, with redwoods in new forests producing thousands per year.<ref name=\":2\" /> The cones themselves hold 90\u2013150 seeds, but viability of seed are low, typically well below 15% with one estimate of average rates being 3 to 10 percent.<ref name=ucberkeley1>{{cite web|title=Botanical Garden Logistics|work=UC Berkeley \u2013 Biology 1B \u2013 Plants & Their Environments (p. 13)|publisher=Department of Integrative Biology, University of California-Berkeley|location=Berkeley, California|url=http://ib.berkeley.edu/courses/bio1b/labschedfall07/labexercises/PlantsEnvironments3_4_3.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513135321/http://ib.berkeley.edu/courses/bio1b/labschedfall07/labexercises/PlantsEnvironments3_4_3.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-13|accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref><ref name=\":2\" /> The low viability may discourage seed predators, which do not want to waste time sorting chaff (empty seeds) from edible seeds. Successful germination often requires a fire or flood, reducing competition for seedlings. The winged seeds are small and light, weighing 3.3\u20135.0&nbsp;mg (200\u2013300 seeds/g; 5,600\u20138,500/ounce). The wings are not effective for wide dispersal, and seeds are dispersed by wind an average of only {{convert|60|\u2013|120|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the parent tree. Seedlings are susceptible to fungal infection and predation by [[banana slug]]s, [[Brush rabbit|bush rabbits]], and [[nematode]]s.<ref name=\":03\" /> Most seedlings do not survive their first three years.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, those that become established grow very fast, with young trees known to reach {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall in 20 years.\n\nCoast redwoods can also reproduce asexually by layering or sprouting from the root crown, stump, or even fallen branches; if a tree falls over, it will regenerate a row of new trees along the trunk, so many trees naturally grow in a straight line. Sprouts originate from dormant or adventitious buds at or under the surface of the bark. The dormant sprouts are stimulated when the main adult stem gets damaged or starts to die. Many sprouts spontaneously erupt and develop around the circumference of the tree trunk. Within a short period after sprouting, each sprout will develop its own root system, with the dominant sprouts forming a ring of trees around the parent root crown or stump. This ring of trees is called a \"fairy ring\". Sprouts can achieve heights of {{convert|2.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in a single growing season.\n\nRedwoods may also reproduce using [[burl]]s. A burl is a woody [[lignotuber]] that commonly appears on a redwood tree below the soil line, though usually within {{convert|3|m|ft|0}} in depth from the soil surface. Coast redwoods develop burls as seedlings from the axils of their [[cotyledon]], a trait that is extremely rare in conifers.<ref name=\":2\" /> When provoked by damage, dormant buds in the burls sprout new shoots and roots. Burls are also capable of sprouting into new trees when detached from the parent tree, though exactly how this happens is yet to be studied. Shoot clones commonly sprout from burls and are often turned into decorative hedges when found in suburbia.\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[File:Coast_Redwood_2015-06_103.jpg|thumb|left|An example of a [[bonsai]] redwood, from the Pacific\nBonsai Museum]]\n[[File:Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail 3.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail]] passing through a fallen California redwood tree]]\nCoast redwood is one of the most valuable [[timber]] species in the lumbering industry.

Many of the old ties have been recycled for use in gardens as borders, steps, house beams, etc. Redwood burls are used in the production of table tops, veneers, and turned goods.\n\nThe [[Yurok]] people, who occupied the region before European settlement, carried out regular burnings of redwood forests to bolster [[Notholithocarpus|tanoak]] populations from which they harvested acorns, to maintain forest openings, and to boost populations of useful plant species such as those for medicine or basketmaking.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/925183647|title=The Redwood Forest: History, Ecology, and Conservation of the Coast Redwoods|last=Noss|first=Reed|last2=|first2=|date=|publisher=Island Press|year=2000|isbn=1559637269|location=|pages=|oclc=925183647}}</ref>\n\nExtensive logging of redwoods began in the early nineteenth century.

This [[montane forest]], situated at over {{convert|6000|ft|m|-2}} [[above mean sea level]] in the western [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] of [[California]], covers an area of {{convert|1880|acre|km2}}. The Giant Forest is the most accessible of all [[List of giant sequoia groves|giant sequoia groves]], as it has over {{convert|40|mi|km}} of [[hiking]] [[trail]]s.\n\nFive of the ten most massive trees on the planet are located within the Giant Forest. The largest of these, the [[General Sherman (tree)|General Sherman tree]], measures {{convert|36.5|ft|m}} across the base. The giant sequoia tree is the most massive species of tree on earth, and one of just five tree species documented to grow to 300 feet in height (the others are [[Coast Redwood]], [[Eucalyptus regnans|Eucalyptus Regnans]], [[Douglas fir]], and [[Sitka spruce|Sitka Spruce]]). It is also among the [[List of oldest trees|longest-lived]] of all trees on the planet.\n\n\n==The area==\n[[File:Sequoia-Grove-Map.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Map showing location of Giant Forest]]\n\nGiant Forest is close to [[Crystal Cave (Sequoia National Park)|Crystal Cave]], [[Moro Rock]] and [[Crescent Meadow]].\n\nThe western trailhead of the [[High Sierra Trail]] which crosses the Sierra Nevada to [[Mount Whitney]] is at the Crescent Meadow parking area.\n\n[[Ponderosa pine|Ponderosa]], [[Jeffrey Pine|Jeffrey]], [[Sugar pine|Sugar]], and [[Lodgepole pine|Lodgepole]] [[pine]] trees are common here, as well as [[Abies concolor|white]] and [[Abies magnifica|red fir]]. Visitors often see [[mule deer]], [[Douglas squirrel]], and [[American black bear]]. The [[National Park Service]] warns visitors not to leave any food in unattended vehicles because bears may break in to steal food.\n\n==Giant Forest Village==\nThe [[giant sequoia]] trees are first encountered on the approach from the south at Giant Forest Village - a small cluster of buildings that is dwarfed by the surrounding trees. Some of the sequoias have become unstable due to root damage caused by building development and hence visitor services in this area have been reduced, including transfer of lodging to Wuksachi Village, {{convert|7|mi|km}} north. The sequoia forest extends mainly east of the village, and is accessed by a {{convert|3|mi|km|sing=on}} side road plus many interconnecting foot trails. These range from 1 to {{convert|5|mi|km}} in length, leading to various named individual trees and clusters of particular importance. The area is generally quite sheltered and receives high rainfall, which is one reason why the sequoia attain such size, but these conditions are also ideal for mosquitoes, which are abundant in the forests most of the year. These provide the only real hazard - the paths are generally quite level and well shaded from the sun.\n\n==History==\nOnce the home of nearly 300 buildings, the region now has four, with no commercial activity. It is a designated \"day use\" area. The [[Giant Forest Lodge Historic District]] was designated in 1978, encompassing the main area of development in the Giant Forest grove. The development was demolished between 1995 and 2000, with day use features moving to the nearby [[Giant Forest Village-Camp Kaweah Historic District]], which was itself extensively altered, and overnight visitor services moving to Wuksachi Village. The area within the grove was restored to nearly natural conditions, allowing the use of fire for forest management and the germination of new sequoia seedlings.\n\n==Access==\nThe forest can be reached from [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] by [[California State Route 180|State Route 180]] or from [[Visalia, California|Visalia]] by [[California State Route 198|State Route 198]]. The [[Generals Highway|Generals' Highway]] connects Giant Forest to [[Kings Canyon National Park]] and the [[General Grant Grove]], home to the [[General Grant tree]] among other giant sequoias.\n\n==Noteworthy trees==\n[[File:General Sherman Tree 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[General Sherman (tree)|General Sherman]], the most massive tree in the world]]\n\nSome of the trees found in the grove that are worthy of special note are:\n* [[General Sherman (tree)|General Sherman]]: In 1931 this tree was established to be the largest living thing in the world, therefore, also the largest tree in the world. It has a volume of 52,508 cubic feet (1,487 cubic meters). The top of the Sherman is a dead limb that at one time served as a leader branch. Its largest limb is around {{convert|7|ft|m}} in diameter. The second-largest tree in the world, the General Grant, is located about 27 miles away in Kings Canyon National Park.\n* [[President (tree)|President]]: Recent measurements by arborists who climbed up into the crown of the tree and rappelled down through the limbs have discovered that the President Tree is actually bigger than the General Grant Tree and is even beginning to rival the General Sherman Tree as the world's largest.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n* Chief Sequoyah: Just uphill from the President tree is the massive and very impressive Chief Sequoyah. This tree is one of the most startlingly rugged trees in the forest.\n* [[Lincoln (tree)]]: This is the fourth largest tree at 44,471 cubic feet (1,259 cubic meters)\n* [[Franklin (tree)]]: Although it is the eighth-largest tree in the world, this tree has been largely ignored, perhaps because it is in such a massive grove with many other large specimens.

All naturally occurring [[Grove (nature)|groves]] of [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|giant sequoias]] are located in moist, unglaciated ridges and valleys of the west slope of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] range in [[California]], [[United States]]. They occur between 1370{{spaced ndash}}2000 meters (4500\u20136500&nbsp;ft) elevation in the northern half of the range, and 1700\u20132250 m (5500\u20137500&nbsp;ft) in the south.\n\nGroves in the northern half of the range (north of the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]]) are widely scattered and mostly small, while those south of the Kings River are more numerous. The total area of all the groves combined is approximately 14,416 ha (35,607 acres). The groves are listed from north to south in the list below.\n\nThis list is based on five different sources, with slightly varying views on what constitutes a discrete grove; the differing interpretations are noted ''in italics''. The lists of groves were compiled by Rundel (1972; recognizing 75 groves), Flint (1987; recognizing 65 groves), Willard (1994; recognizing 65 groves), the ''[[Giant Sequoia National Monument]] Visitor's Guide'' (2003) and the Draft Giant Sequoia National Monument Plan 2010. Currently, the [[United States|U.S.]] [[National Park Service]] cites Rundel's total of 75 groves in its visitor publications. The updated lists from Willard and Flint are now known to be more accurate, therefore some of Rundel's 75 groves have been removed from this list. Below compiles a list of 68 sequoia groves.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr151/psw_gtr151_28_willard.pdf|publisher=USFS|title=The Natural Giant Sequoia (''Sequoiadendron Giganteum'') Groves of the Sierra Nevada, California\u2014An Updated Annotated List|first=Dwight|last=Willard|accessdate=2014-05-14|series=USDA Forest Service Gen.

Because most of the neighboring trees are also quite large, it can be difficult to appreciate the size of an individual giant sequoia. The largest giant sequoias are as tall as a 26-story building, and the width of their bases can exceed that of a city street. They grow at such a rate as to produce roughly {{Convert|40|ft3|m3}} of wood each year, approximately equal to the volume of a 50-foot-tall tree one foot in diameter.<ref name=NPS2009/> This makes them among the fastest growing organisms on Earth, in terms of annual increase in mass.\n\n==Distribution==\n[[File:General Grant Tree in Kings Canyon National Park.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[General Grant (tree)|General Grant tree]], [[General Grant Grove]], [[Kings Canyon National Park]], 2007]]\n\nGiant sequoias occur naturally in only one place on Earth\u2014the western slope of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range in [[California]], on moist, [[Glacier|unglaciated]] ridges and valleys<ref name=Zinke1994/> at an altitude of {{Convert|5000|to|8000|ft|m|0}} [[above mean sea level]]. There are 65\u201375 groves of giant sequoias in the Sierra Nevada, depending upon the criteria used to define a grove.<ref name=GSNM2010/><ref name=Willard1994/> The northernmost of these groves is [[Tahoe National Forest#Groves|Placer County Grove]] in the [[Tahoe National Forest]], [[Placer County, California]],<ref name=Schaffer1998/> while the southernmost grove is [[Deer Creek Grove]] in the [[Giant Sequoia National Monument]], [[Tulare County, California]].<ref name=Willard1994/> The combined total area of [[List of giant sequoia groves|all groves of giant sequoias]] is approximately {{Convert|35600|acre|ha|0}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n==Fire limits growth==\n{{anchor|Damaging agents}}\n\nGiant sequoias are in many ways adapted to forest fires. Their bark is unusually fire resistant, and their cones will normally open immediately after a fire.<ref>National Geographic Magazine, December 2012</ref> However, fire is also the most serious damaging agent of giant sequoias. Seedlings and saplings are highly susceptible to death or serious injury by fire. Larger giant sequoias are more resistant to fire damage, due to their thick protective layer of nonresinous [[bark]] and elevated crowns. However, repeated fires over many centuries may penetrate the bark and destroy the [[vascular cambium]]. Nearly all of the larger trees have fire scars, many of which cover a large area of the base of the tree. Older trees are rarely killed by fire alone, but the resulting structural damage may predispose a tree to collapse and fire scars also provide entry for [[fungus|fungi]] which may cause [[Laminated root rot|root disease]] and [[heart rot]]. The resulting decayed wood is then more easily consumed by subsequent fires. The result of this cycle is further structural weakening of the tree, which may eventually lead to its collapse.<ref name=Weatherspoon1990/>\n\nFire scars are thought to be the main cause of dead tops. Although [[lightning strike]]s rarely kill mature trees, lightning sometimes knocks out large portions of crowns or ignites dead tops. The most common cause of death in mature giant sequoias is toppling, due to weakening of the roots and lower trunk by fire and decay. The extreme weight of the trees coupled with their shallow root systems contributes to this weakening. Other causative factors include wind, water-softened soils, undercutting by streams, and heavy snow loads in the crowns<ref name=Weatherspoon1990/>\n[[File:Washington Tree 2007.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Washington (tree)|Washington tree]], Giant Forest Grove, Sequoia National Park, 2007]]\n\nThe [[Washington (tree)|Washington tree]], located in the [[Giant Forest|Giant Forest Grove]] in [[Sequoia National Park]] provides a good example of the aforementioned phenomena. This tree was the second largest tree in the world (only the [[General Sherman (tree)|General Sherman tree]] was larger) until just a few years ago.<ref name=Martin2005/><ref name=Sillett2001/> In September 2003, the tree lost a portion of its crown as a result of a fire caused by a lightning strike. This reduced its height from nearly {{convert|255|ft|m}} to about {{convert|229|ft|m}}. The structurally weakened tree partially collapsed in January 2005, as the result of a heavy snow load in the remaining portion of its crown; it is now approximately {{convert|115|ft|m}} tall.<ref name=Martin2005/><ref name=Block2005/>\n\n==Tree measurement==\nAs with other trees, measurement of giant sequoias is conducted using established [[dendrometry|dendrometric]] techniques. The most frequent measurements acquired in the field include the height of the tree, the horizontal dimension of its canopy, and its [[diameter at breast height]] (DBH). These measurements are then subjected to [[tree allometry]], which employs certain mathematical and [[Statistics|statistical]] principles to estimate the amount of [[Lumber|timber]] volume in a tree.\n\nCalculating the volume of a standing tree is the practical equivalent of calculating the [[Volume#Cone|volume of an irregular cone]],<ref name=NPS1997/> and is subject to error for various reasons. This is partly due to technical difficulties in measurement, and variations in the shape of trees and their trunks. Measurements of trunk [[circumference]] are taken at only a few predetermined heights up the trunk, and assume that the trunk is circular in [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]], and that taper between measurement points is even. Also, only the volume of the trunk (including the restored volume of basal fire scars) is taken into account, and not the volume of wood in the branches or roots.<ref name=NPS1997/> The volume measurements also do not take cavities into account. For example, while studying sequoia tree canopies in 1999, researchers discovered that the Washington tree in Giant Forest Grove was largely hollow.<ref name=Block2005/>\n\n==List of largest giant sequoias by trunk volume==\nThe following table is a list of the largest giant sequoias, all of which are located in California. The table is sorted by [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] volume, ignoring wood in the branches of the tree. Many sequoias cut down in the past were probably far larger, such as the [[Mother of the Forest]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Rank\n! Name\n! Location<ref name=Flint2002/>\n!

Record trees have been measured to be {{convert|94.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height. Claims of {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=on}} diameter have been touted by taking an author's writing<ref name=\"Flint 2002\">{{Harvnb|Flint|2002}}</ref> out of context, but the widest known at chest height is closer to {{convert|8.2|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Between 2014 and 2016, specimens of [[Sequoia sempervirens|coast redwood]] were found to have larger trunk diameters than all known giant sequoias.<ref name=\"mdvaden.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mdvaden.com/redwood_year_discovery.shtml|title=Coast Redwood Discovery. Sequoia sempervirens|first=M.D.|last=Vaden}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest known giant sequoia based on [[dendrochronology|ring count]] is 3,500 years old. Giant Sequoias are among [[List of longest-living organisms|the oldest living things]] on Earth. Sequoia bark is fibrous, furrowed, and may be {{convert|90|cm|ft|abbr=on}} thick at the base of the columnar trunk. It provides significant fire protection for the trees. The leaves are [[evergreen]], awl-shaped, {{convert|3|-|6|mm}} long, and arranged spirally on the shoots. The seed [[Conifer cone|cones]] are {{convert|4|-|7|cm}} long and mature in 18\u201320 months, though they typically remain green and closed for up to 20 years; each cone has 30\u201350 spirally arranged scales, with several [[seed]]s on each scale, giving an average of 230 seeds per cone. The seed is dark brown, {{convert|4|-|5|mm}} long and {{convert|1|mm}} broad, with a {{convert|1|mm|adj=on}} wide, yellow-brown wing along each side. Some seeds are shed when the cone scales shrink during hot weather in late summer, but most are liberated when the cone dries from fire heat or is damaged by insects.\n\n[[File:Sequoiadendron giganteum MHNT.BOT.2004.0.191.jpg|thumb|left|Giant sequoia cones and seed]]\nThe giant sequoia regenerates by seed. Young trees start to bear cones at the age of 12 years. Trees up to about 20 years old may produce stump sprouts subsequent to injury, but unlike coast redwoods, shoots do not form on the stumps of mature trees. Giant sequoias of all ages may sprout from their [[Bole (botany)|bole]]s when branches are lost to fire or breakage.\n\nAt any given time, a large tree may be expected to have about 11,000 cones. Cone production is greatest in the upper portion of the canopy. A mature giant sequoia has been estimated to disperse 300,000\u2013400,000 seeds per year. The winged seeds may be carried up to {{convert|180|m|ft}} from the parent tree.\n\nLower branches die fairly readily from shading, but trees less than 100 years old retain most of their dead branches. Trunks of mature trees in groves are generally free of branches to a height of {{convert|20|-|50|m}}, but solitary trees will retain low branches.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Biology==\nBecause of its size, the tree has been studied for its water pull. Water from the roots can be pushed up only a few meters by [[osmotic pressure]] but can reach extreme heights by using a system of branching [[capillarity]] (capillary action) in the tree's [[xylem]] (the water tubules) and sub-pressure from evaporating water at the leaves.<ref>[http://www.cropsreview.com/transpiration-pull.html water pull] at Cropsview  (an agriculture science magazine) website</ref> Sequoias supplement water from the soil with fog, taken up through [[air root]]s, at heights to where the root water cannot be pulled.<ref>[http://www.howstuffworks.com/life/botany/tree-grow.htm Studies on tree height limits, and the Sequoia in particular]</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\n[[File:A014, Sequoia National Park, California, USA, 1998.jpg|thumb|The [[Generals Highway]] passes between giant sequoias in Sequoia National Park]]\nThe natural distribution of giant sequoias is restricted to a limited area of the western [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], [[California]]. They occur in scattered groves, with a total of 68 groves (see [[list of sequoia groves]] for a full inventory), comprising a total area of only {{convert|144.16|km2|acre|abbr=on}}. Nowhere does it grow in pure stands, although in a few small areas, stands do approach a pure condition. The northern two-thirds of its range, from the [[American River]] in [[Placer County, California|Placer County]] southward to the [[Kings River (California)|Kings River]], has only eight disjunct groves. The remaining southern groves are concentrated between the Kings River and the Deer Creek Grove in southern [[Tulare County, California|Tulare County]]. Groves range in size from {{convert|12.4|km2|acre|abbr=on}} with 20,000 mature trees, to small groves with only six living trees. Many are protected in [[Sequoia National Park|Sequoia]] and [[Kings Canyon National Park]]s and [[Giant Sequoia National Monument]].\n\nThe giant sequoia is usually found in a humid climate characterized by dry summers and [[snow]]y winters. Most giant sequoia groves are on granitic-based residual and [[alluvium|alluvial]] soils. The elevation of the giant sequoia groves generally ranges from {{convert|1400|-|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the north, to {{convert|1700|-|2150|m|ft}} to the south. Giant sequoias generally occur on the south-facing sides of northern mountains, and on the northern faces of more southerly slopes.\n\nHigh levels of reproduction are not necessary to maintain the present population levels. Few groves, however, have sufficient young trees to maintain the present density of mature giant sequoias for the future. The majority of giant sequoias are currently undergoing a gradual decline in density since European settlement.\n\nWhile the present day distribution of this species is limited to a small area of California, it was once much more widely distributed in prehistoric times, and was a reasonably common species in North American and Eurasian coniferous forests until its range was greatly reduced by the last [[ice age]]. Older fossil specimens reliably identified as giant sequoia have been found in [[Cretaceous]] era sediments from a number of sites in North America and Europe, and even as far afield as New Zealand<ref>James E Eckenwalder. Conifers of the World, The Complete Reference. p 586. Timber Press 2009. ISBN 9780881929744</ref> and Australia.<ref>Bryan G Bowes. Trees and Forests, a colour guide. pp 48-49. Manson Publishing 2010. ISBN 9781840760859</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Sequoia trees.JPG|thumb|Two giant sequoias, [[Sequoia National Park]]. Note the large fire scar at the base of the right-hand tree; fires do not typically kill the trees but do remove competing thin-barked species, and aid giant sequoia regeneration.]]\n\nGiant sequoias are in many ways adapted to forest fires. Their bark is unusually fire resistant, and their cones will normally open immediately after a fire.<ref>National Geographic Magazine December 2012</ref> The giant sequoias are having difficulty reproducing in their original habitat (and very rarely reproduce in cultivation) due to the seeds only being able to grow successfully in full sun and in mineral-rich soils, free from competing vegetation. Although the seeds can germinate in moist needle [[humus]] in the spring, these seedlings will die as the duff dries in the summer. They therefore require periodic [[wildfire]] to clear competing vegetation and soil humus before successful regeneration can occur. Without fire, shade-loving species will crowd out young sequoia seedlings, and sequoia seeds will not germinate. When fully grown, these trees typically require large amounts of water and are therefore often concentrated near streams.\n\nFires also bring hot air high into the canopy via [[convection]], which in turn dries and opens the cones. The subsequent release of large quantities of seeds coincides with the optimal postfire [[seedbed]] conditions. Loose ground ash may also act as a cover to protect the fallen seeds from [[ultraviolet radiation]] damage.\n\nDue to fire suppression efforts and livestock grazing during the early and mid 20th century, low-intensity fires no longer occurred naturally in many groves, and still do not occur in some groves today. The suppression of fires also led to ground fuel build-up and the dense growth of fire-sensitive [[white fir]]. This increased the risk of more intense fires that can use the firs as ladders to threaten mature giant sequoia crowns. Natural fires may also be important in keeping [[carpenter ant]]s in check.\n\nIn 1970, the [[National Park Service]] began controlled burns of its groves to correct these problems. Current policies also allow natural fires to burn. One of these untamed burns severely damaged the second-largest tree in the world, the [[Washington tree]], in September 2003, 45 days after the fire started. This damage made it unable to withstand the snowstorm of January 2005, leading to the collapse of over half the trunk.\n\nIn addition to fire, two animal agents also assist giant sequoia seed release. The more significant of the two is a [[longhorn beetle]] (''[[Phymatodes nitidus]]'') that lays eggs on the cones, into which the larvae then bore holes. This cuts the vascular water supply to the cone scales, allowing the cones to dry and open for the seeds to fall. Cones damaged by the beetles during the summer will slowly open over the next several months. Some research indicates many cones, particularly higher in the crowns, may need to be partially dried by beetle damage before fire can fully open them. The other agent is the [[Douglas squirrel]] (''Tamiasciurus douglasi'') that gnaws on the fleshy green scales of younger cones. The squirrels are active year round, and some seeds are dislodged and dropped as the cone is eaten.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nps.gov/seki/naturescience/upload/hh_tt67.pdf|title=The Fire Ecology of Sequoia Regeneration|journal=Tall Timbers Fire Ecology Conference|volume=7|page=7|first1=RJ|last1=Hartesveldt|first2=HT|last2=Harvey|year=1967}}</ref>\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Giant sequoia exhibitionism.jpg|thumb|Shortly after their discovery by Europeans, giant sequoias were subject to much exhibition]]\nThe giant sequoia was well known to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes living in its area. Native American names for the species include ''wawona'', ''toos-pung-ish'' and ''hea-mi-withic'', the latter two in the language of the Tule River Tribe.\n\nThe first reference to the giant sequoia by Europeans is in 1833, in the diary of the explorer J. K. Leonard; the reference does not mention any locality, but his route would have taken him through the [[Calaveras Big Trees State Park|Calaveras Grove]].<ref name=\"farquhar\">{{cite journal|last=Farquhar|first=Francis P.|title=Discovery of the Sierra Nevada|year=1925|journal=California Historical Society Quarterly|volume=4|pages=3\u201358|url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/exploration_of_the_sierra_nevada/|issue=1|doi=10.2307/25177743}}, Yosemite.ca.us</ref> This discovery was not publicized. The next European to see the species was John M. Wooster, who carved his initials in the bark of the 'Hercules' tree in the Calaveras Grove in 1850; again, this received no publicity. Much more publicity was given to the \"discovery\" by Augustus T. Dowd of the Calaveras Grove in 1852, and this is commonly cited as the species' discovery.<ref name=\"farquhar\"/> The tree found by Dowd, christened the 'Discovery Tree', was felled in 1853.\n\nThe first scientific naming of the species was by [[John Lindley]] in December 1853, who named it ''Wellingtonia gigantea'', without realizing this was an invalid name under the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|botanical code]] as the name ''Wellingtonia'' had already been used earlier for another unrelated plant (''[[Wellingtonia arnottiana]]'' in the family [[Sabiaceae]]). The name \"Wellingtonia\" has persisted in England as a common name.<ref>{{cite book|first=R.|last=Ornduff|editor-last=Aune|editor-first=P.

The name ''Washingtonia californica'' was also applied to it by Winslow in 1854, though this too is invalid, belonging to the [[Arecaceae|palm]] genus ''[[Washingtonia]]''.\n[[File:Closepintree.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Clothespin tree in the [[Mariposa Grove]], [[Yosemite National Park]]]]\nIn 1907, it was placed by [[Carl Ernst Otto Kuntze]] in the otherwise [[fossil]] genus ''[[Steinhauera]]'', but doubt as to whether the giant sequoia is related to the fossil originally so named makes this name invalid.\n\nThe nomenclatural oversights were finally corrected in 1939 by [[John T. Buchholz|J. Buchholz]], who also pointed out the giant sequoia is distinct from the coast redwood at the genus level and coined the name ''Sequoiadendron giganteum'' for it.\n\nThe etymology of the genus name has been presumed{{mdash}}initially in ''The Yosemite Book'' by [[Josiah Whitney]] in 1868<ref name=cnps1/>{{mdash}}to be in honor of [[Sequoyah]] (1767\u20131843), who was the inventor of the [[Cherokee syllabary]].<ref name=natcomp/> An etymological study published in 2012, however, concluded that the name was more likely to have originated from the Latin ''sequi'' (meaning ''to follow'') since the number of seeds per cone in the newly-classified genus fell in mathematical sequence with the other four genera in the suborder.<ref name=cnps2/>\n\n[[John Muir]] wrote of the species in about 1870:<blockquote>\n\"Do behold the King in his glory, King Sequoia! Behold! Behold! seems all I can say. Some time ago I left all for Sequoia and have been and am at his feet, fasting and praying for light, for is he not the greatest light in the woods, in the world? Where are such columns of sunshine, tangible, accessible, terrestrialized?' <ref>{{cite book |last1=Muir|first1=John|editor1-first=Terry|editor1-last=Gifford|title=John Muir: His Life and Letters and Other Writings|date=November 1996|publisher=Mountaineers Books|isbn=0898864631|pages=139\u2013140}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Uses==\n\nWood from mature giant sequoias is highly resistant to decay, but due to being fibrous and brittle, it is generally unsuitable for construction. From the 1880s through the 1920s, logging took place in many groves in spite of marginal commercial returns. The [[Hume-Bennett Lumber Company]] was the last to harvest giant sequoia, going out of business in 1924.<ref>{{cite web|title = Battle against Rough fire intensifies as blaze bears down on Hume Lake|url = http://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article31640498.html|website = fresnobee|accessdate = 2015-10-18}}</ref> Due to their weight and brittleness, trees would often shatter when they hit the ground, wasting much of the wood. Loggers attempted to cushion the impact by digging trenches and filling them with branches. Still, as little as 50% of the timber is estimated to have made it from groves to the mill. The wood was used mainly for shingles and fence posts, or even for matchsticks.\n\nPictures of the once majestic trees broken and abandoned in formerly pristine groves, and the thought of the giants put to such modest use, spurred the public outcry that caused most of the groves to be preserved as protected land. The public can visit an example of 1880s clear-cutting at [[Big Stump Grove]] near [[General Grant Grove]]. As late as the 1980s, some immature trees were logged in [[Sequoia National Forest]], publicity of which helped lead to the creation of [[Giant Sequoia National Monument]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe wood from immature trees is less brittle, with recent tests on young [[plantation]]-grown trees showing it similar to coast redwood wood in quality. This is resulting in some interest in cultivating giant sequoia as a very high-yielding timber crop tree, both in California and also in parts of western Europe, where it may grow more efficiently than coast redwoods. In the northwest [[United States]], some entrepreneurs have also begun growing giant sequoias for [[Christmas tree]]s. Besides these attempts at tree farming, the principal economic uses for giant sequoia today are [[tourism]] and [[horticulture]].\n\n==Cultivation==\n[[File:Benmore.jpg|thumb|The well-known giant sequoia avenue at [[Benmore Botanic Garden]], planted in 1863. These trees are all over 50 m tall.]]\nGiant sequoia is a very popular [[ornamental tree]] in many areas. It is successfully grown in most of western and southern Europe, the Pacific Northwest of North America north to southwest [[British Columbia]], the southern United States, southeast Australia, New Zealand and central-southern [[Chile]]. It is also grown, though less successfully, in parts of eastern North America.\n\nTrees can withstand temperatures of \u221231&nbsp;\u00b0C (\u221225&nbsp;\u00b0F) or colder for short periods of time, provided the ground around the roots is insulated with either heavy snow or mulch.

Brigham Young University Press, Provo.</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe Pacific yew is a small to medium-sized evergreen [[tree]], growing 10\u201315&nbsp;m tall and with a trunk up to 50&nbsp;cm diameter, rarely more. In some instances, trees with heights in excess of 20&nbsp;m occur in parks and other protected areas, quite often in gullies. The tree is extremely slow growing, and has a habit of rotting from the inside, creating hollow forms. This makes it difficult and sometimes impossible to make accurate rings counts to determine a specimen's true age. Often damaged by succession of the forest, it usually ends up in a squat, multiple leader form.\n\nIt has thin scaly brown [[bark]], covering a thin layer of off-white sap wood with a darker heartwood that varies in color from brown to a magenta/purplish hue. The [[leaf|leaves]] are lanceolate, flat, dark green, 1\u20133&nbsp;cm long and 2\u20133&nbsp;mm broad, arranged spirally on the stem, but with the leaf bases twisted to align the leaves in two flat rows either side of the stem except on erect leading shoots where the spiral arrangement is more obvious.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|seed cones]] are highly modified, each cone containing a single [[seed]] 4\u20137&nbsp;mm long partly surrounded by a modified scale which develops into a soft, bright red [[Berry (botany)|berry]]-like structure called an [[aril]], 8\u201315&nbsp;mm long and wide and open at the end. The arils are mature 6\u20139 months after pollination. The seeds contained in the arils are eaten by [[Thrush (bird)|thrushes]] and other [[bird]]s, which disperse the hard seeds undamaged in their droppings; maturation of the arils is spread over 2\u20133 months, increasing the chances of successful seed dispersal. The male cones are globose, 3\u20136&nbsp;mm diameter, and shed their [[pollen]] in early spring. It is mostly [[Plant sexuality|dioecious]], but occasional individuals can be variably [[Plant sexuality|monoecious]], or change sex with time.\n\n==Habitat==\nPacific yew grows in varying types of environments; however, in drier environments it is mostly limited to stream side habitats, whereas in moist environments it will grow up onto slopes and ridgetops.<ref name = Bolsinger1965/> Pacific yew is [[Shade tolerance|shade tolerant]]; however it can also grow in sun.<ref name = Mitchell>{{cite journal|last = Mitchell| first = A. |title = Acclimation of Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia) foliage to sun and shade | journal = Tree Physiology | volume = 18| url = http://treephys.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/11/749.full.pdf+html}}</ref> The tree's shade tolerance allows it to form an [[understory]], which means that it can grow along streams providing shade to maintain water temperature.<ref>{{cite web| title = Pacific Yew: a Faculative Riparian Conifer with an Uncertain Future | last = Scher | first = Stanley | last2 = Schwarzschild | first2 = Bert | year = 1989 | url = http://gis.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr110/psw_gtr110_d_scher.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Varieties of Pacific yew (''Taxus brevifolia'')==\n\n'''''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''reptaneta'''''. Although ''T. brevifolia'' is typically a tree as described above, ''T. brevifolia'' var. ''reptaneta'' is a shrub variety that generally occurs in the mid to upper elevation range of the typical variety, 3,500 to 4,000&nbsp;ft (1000\u20131219 m) at its southernmost occurrence in the [[Klamath Mountains]] region, and at lower elevations further north.<ref name=\"Spjut2007b\">Spjut, R. W. 2007. Taxonomy and nomenclature of ''Taxus''.  J. Bot. Res. Inst. Texas 1(1): 203\u2013289.</ref>  It is distinguished from young trees of the typical variety (var. ''brevifolia'') by its stems initially creeping along the ground for a short distance before ascending (curving) upwards and by the branches growing off to one side of the stem, usually the upper side.<ref>Web page, World Botanical Associates, ''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''reptaneta''; http://www.worldbotanical.com/taxus_brevifolia_var_reptaneta.htm. Retrieved 9 Dec 2014</ref> The epithet ''reptaneta'' is from the Latin reptans which means \u201ccreeping, prostrate, and rooting,\u201d<ref>Stearn, W. T.  1983.  Botanical Latin.  3rd ed.  David & Charles, London</ref> which is exactly what this variety does; in rooting it forms yew thickets; hence, the epithet ''reptaneta'' (etum means collective place of growth) and hence the common name, thicket yew. Unlike the typical variety, thicket yew grows in abundance on open sunny avalanche shoots or ravines as well as in the forest understory.  It also occurs along forest margins. In northwestern Montana, a variant of the thicket yew does not ascend upwards; rather, it remains along the ground.<ref name=\"Spjut2007b\" />  This is probably the ancestral form; the upright form with branches along the upper side would be the expected growth pattern that might evolve from one with stems that strictly creep along the ground since branches can only arise from the upper surface.\n\n''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''reptaneta'' has been arbitrarily indicated synonymous with typical yew, ''T. brevifolia'' (var. ''brevifolia''); there are no studies to support this view.  Even though the two varieties may be genetically distinct, some botanists recognize species or varieties only if they have different geographically ranges. For example, ''T. mairei'' var. ''speciosa'', which occurs with the typical variety in southern China in 10 of 13 provinces, was rejected because \u201cthere is no geographic reason\u201d for recognizing it<ref>M\u00f6ller M, Gao L-M, Mill RR, Liu J, Zhang D-Q, Poudel RC, Li D-Z, 2013. A multidisciplinary approach reveals hidden taxonomic diversity in the morphologically challenging ''Taxus wallichiana'' complex. Taxon 62: 1161\u20131177.</ref> even though it appears genetically distinct.<ref>Gao L-M, M\u00f6ller M, Zhang X-M, Hollingsworth ML, Liu J, Mill RR, Gibby M, Li D-Z, 2007. High variation and strong phylogeographic pattern among cpDNA haplotypes in ''Taxus wallichiana'' (Taxaceae) in China and North Vietnam. Molec. Ecol. 16: 4684\u20134698.</ref>\n\n''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''reptaneta'' has also been proposed to be elevated to subspecies status without justification or explanation. Such a change would likely cause considerable confusion in view of the subspecies rank having already been used in the genus ''Taxus'' for defining geographically separated subspecies of a single species (''T. baccata'').<ref>Pilger R, 1903. Taxaceae-Taxoideae\u2014Taxeae. ''Taxus''. In: Das Pflanzenreich IV (Engler A. ed.): 110\u2013116.</ref>  Further, it has been recommended that taxonomists be strongly discouraged from \u201celevating a \u2018variety\u2019 to a \u2018subspecies\u2019 unless there is sufficient scientific evidence to warrant such an elevation,\u201d and that \u201cit is crucial to provide continuity.\u201d<ref>Ellison AM, Davis CC, Calie PJ, Naczi RFC, 2014. Pitcher plants (''Sarracenia'') provide a 21st-century perspective on infraspecific ranks and interspecific hybrids: A modest proposal for appropriate recognition and usage. Syst. Bot. 39: 939\u2013949.</ref>\n\n'''''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''polychaeta'''''.  Typical ''Taxus brevifolia'', like most species in the genus, usually produces a single ovule on a complex scaly shoot, composed of a primary shoot and a secondary short shoot. To the casual observer they appear as one funnelform shoot with an ovule at the apex.<ref>Florin R, 1951. Evolution in cordaites and conifers. Acta Horti Berg. 16: 285\u2013388, plate</ref>  However, ''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''polychaeta'' differs from var. ''brevifolia'' in producing a relatively longer primary shoot<ref name=\"Spjut2007b\" /> with as many five secondary shoots.<ref>Web page, World Botanical Associates, Overview of the genus ''Taxus'', http://www.worldbotanical.com/TAXNA.HTM, retrieved 9 Dec 2014</ref> The epithet, ''polychaeta'', is in reference to the primary shoot resembling a [[polychaete]] worm; hence, its common name \u201cworm cone yew.\u201d Variety ''polychaeta'' appears to be relatively rare. It may have been [[extirpated]] from the type locality\u2014around Mud Bay near Olympia, Washington\u2014as a result of urban expansion. It is also known from northern Idaho and Sonoma County, California.<ref name=\"Spjut2007b\" /><ref>Web page, World Botanical Associates, ''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''polychaeta''; http://www.worldbotanical.com/taxus_brevifolia_var_polychaeta.htm; retrieved 9 Dec 2014</ref>\n\nAs in the case with thicket yew, worm yew has been indicated to be the same as the typical variety, but again there are no specific studies to support this conclusion.  The authority of thicket yew and worm cone yew has been involved in the study of the genus ''Taxus'' for 25 years at the time the varieties were described.<ref name=\"Spjut2007b\" /><ref>Spjut, R.

As it was already becoming scarce when its chemotherapeutic potential was realized, the Pacific yew was never commercially harvested from its habitat at a large scale; the widespread use of the paclitaxel (taxol) was enabled when a semi-synthetic pathway was developed from extracts of cultivated yews of other species. Unlicensed pharmaceutical production use of closely related wild yew species in India and China may be threatening some of those species.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = BGCI\n  | first = \n  | title = \u2018Miracle\u2019 Cures Face Extinction\n  | url=http://www.bgci.org/medicinal/2040\n  | accessdate = 2008-07-21 }}\n</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage: PacificYew_7684.jpg|Pacific Yew foliage underside\nImage: PacificYew_8544.jpg|Pacific Yew form\nImage: PacificYew_8538.jpg|Pacific Yew foliage\nImage:PacificYew_7790.jpg|Pacific Yew mat form\nImage: PacificYew_8566.jpg|Pacific Yew bark\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons-inline}}\n* {{IUCN2006|assessor=Conifer Specialist Group|year=1998|id=34041|title=Taxus brevifolia|downloaded=05 May 2006}}\n* Heiken, D.

Saplings that do not produce the chemical often rot at an early stage, causing some trees to grow with a somewhat hollow, rotten trunk.<ref name=\"stewart 22\"/>\n\nIt is also widely used throughout Europe and America for making [[beehive]] frames.\n\n== Role in indigenous societies ==\n[[File:Klallam people near canoe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Klallam]] people and canoe, ca. 1914]]\n\nWestern redcedar has an extensive history of use by [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Native Americans]] of coastal Oregon to southeast Alaska. Some northwest coast tribes refer to themselves as \"people of the redcedar\" because of their extensive dependence on the tree for basic materials. The wood has been used for constructing housing and [[totem pole]]s, and crafted into many objects, including masks, utensils, boxes, boards, instruments, canoes, vessels, houses, and ceremonial objects. Roots and bark were used for baskets, bowls, ropes, clothing, blankets, and rings.<ref name=\"stewart 17 19\">Stewart, pp. 17\u201319</ref><ref>Van Pelt, p. 30</ref>\n\n===History===\nA huge number of archeological finds point to the continuous use of redcedar wood in native societies. Woodworking tools dating between 8000 and 5000 years ago, such as carved antlers, were discovered in [[shell midden]]s at the Glenrose site, near [[Vancouver]], British Columbia.<ref name=\"stewart 27\">Stewart, p. 27</ref> In [[Yuquot, British Columbia|Yuquot]], on the west coast of Vancouver Island, tools dating 4000 to 3000 years old have been found.<ref name=\"stewart 27\"/> The Musqueam site, also near Vancouver, yielded bark baskets woven in five different styles, along with ropes and ships dated to 3000 years ago. At [[Pitt River]], [[adze]]s and baskets were dated around 2900 years aol. Wooden artifacts 1000 years old were unearthed on the east coast of [[Vancouver Island]].<ref name=\"stewart 26\">Stewart, p. 26</ref>\n\nRed cedar was used extensively wherever it was found along the northwest coast ([[British Columbia]], [[Washington state]], Parts of [[Alaska]]). Evidence of this use is found in CMTs ([[Culturally Modified Trees]]) that are found throughout the coast. When First Nations people removed the bark from cedars, it left a scar - which is considered a CMT. Other types of harvest (for planks, tinder, and other uses) leave different types of evidence of cultural modification.\n\nA legend amongst the [[Coast Salish peoples]] describes the origins of the western redcedar. In this legend, there was a generous man who gave the people whatever they needed. When the [[Great Spirit]] saw this, he declared that when the generous man died, a great redcedar tree will grow where he is buried, and that the cedar will be useful to all the people, providing its roots for baskets, bark for clothing, and wood for shelter.<ref name=\"stewart 27\"/>\n\n=== Tools ===\nThe wood was worked primarily with the [[adze]], which was preferred over all other tools, even ones introduced by European settlers. Alexander Walker, an ensign on the fur trade ship ''Captain Cook'', reported that the indigenous peoples used an elbow adze, which they valued over new tools brought by the Europeans, such as the [[saw]] or the [[axe]], going so far as to modify traded tools back into an adze. Tools were generally made from stone, bone, [[obsidian]], or a harder wood such as [[Tsuga|hemlock]]. A variety of hand [[Post maul|maul]]s, wedges, chisels, and knives were used. Excavations done at [[Ozette, Washington]] turned up iron tools nearly 800 years old, far before European contact. When [[James Cook]] passed the area, he observed that almost all tools were made of iron.<ref name=\"stewart 36\">Stewart, p. 36</ref> There has been speculation on the origin of these iron tools. Some theories include shipwrecks from [[East Asia]] or possible contact with iron-using cultures from [[Siberia]], as hinted in the more advanced woodworking found in northern tribes such as the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]].<ref name=\"stewart 36\"/><ref>Pritzker, p. 292</ref><ref>Miller, p. 67</ref><ref>DeCapua, pp. 16\u201320</ref>\n\n=== Wood ===\n[[File:Moa-4.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A pole outside a six-post house at the [[University of British Columbia]]]]\nHarvesting redcedars required some ceremony and included propitiation of the tree's spirits as well as those of the surrounding trees. In particular, many people specifically requested the tree and its brethren not to fall or drop heavy branches on the harvester,<ref name=\"stewart 39\">Stewart, p. 39</ref> a situation which is mentioned in a number of different stories of people who were not sufficiently careful. Some professional loggers of Native American descent have mentioned that they offer quiet or silent propitiations to trees which they fell, following in this tradition.\n\nFelling of large trees such as redcedar before the introduction of steel tools was a complex and time-consuming art. Typically the bark was removed around the base of the tree above the buttresses. Then some amount of cutting and splitting with stone adzes and mauls would be done, creating a wide triangular cut. The area above and below the cut would be covered with a mixture of wet moss and clay as a firebreak. Then the cut would be packed with tinder and small kindling and slowly burned. The process of cutting and burning would alternate until the tree was mostly penetrated through, and then careful tending of the fire would fell the tree in the best direction for handling. This process could take many days. Constant rotation of workers was involved to keep the fires burning through night and day, often in a remote and forbidding location.<ref name=\"stewart 37 38\">Stewart, pp. 37\u201338</ref>\n\nOnce the tree was felled, the work had only just begun, as it then had to be stripped and dragged down to shore. If the tree was to become canoes, then it would often be divided into sections and worked into rough canoe shapes before transport. If it were to be used for a totem pole or building materials, it would be towed in the round to the village.<ref name=\"stewart 40\">Stewart, p. 40</ref> Many trees are still felled in this traditional manner for use as totem poles and canoes, particularly by artists who feel that using modern tools is detrimental to the traditional spirit of the art. Non-traditionalists simply buy redcedar logs or lumber at mills or lumber yards, a practice that is commonly followed by most working in smaller sizes such as for masks and staves.\n\nBecause felling required such an extraordinary amount of work, if only planks for housing were needed, these would be split from the living tree. The bark was stripped and saved, and two cuts were made at the ends of the planking. Then wedges would be pounded in along the sides and the planks slowly split off the side of the tree.<ref name=\"stewart 42\">Stewart, p. 42</ref> Trees which have been so harvested are still visible in some places in the rainforest, with obvious chunks taken off of their sides. Such trees usually continue to grow perfectly well, since redcedar wood is resistant to decay. Planks are straightened by a variety of methods, including weighing them down with stones, lashing them together with rope, or forcing them between a line of stakes.<ref name=\"stewart 43\">Stewart, p. 43</ref>\n\n[[File:Thuja plicata bark.png|thumb|upright|Illustration of women pulling bark from a tree, from ''Indian Legends of Vancouver Island'' by Alfred Carmichael]]\nRedcedar wood is used to make huge [[monoxyla]] [[canoe]]s in which the men went out to high sea to harpoon [[whale]]s and conduct trade.<ref>McNeese, p. 43</ref> One of those canoes, a {{convert|38|ft|m|adj=on}} craft dug out about a century ago, was bought in 1901 by Captain [[John Voss (sailor)|John Voss]], an adventurer. He gave her the name of [[Tilikum (boat)|Tilikum]] (\"Friend\" in Chinook jargon), rigged her, and led her in a hectic three-year voyage from British Columbia to [[London]].<ref>Dill, pp. 127\u2013128</ref>\n\nRedcedar branches are very flexible and have good tensile strength. They were stripped and used as strong cords for [[fishing]] line, rope cores, twine, and other purposes where bark cord was not strong enough or might fray. Both the branches and bark rope have been replaced by modern fiber and nylon cordage among the aboriginal northwest coast peoples, though the bark is still in use for the other purposes mentioned above.\n\n=== Bark ===\nAt the right time of year, the [[bark]] is easily removed from live trees in long strips. It is harvested for use in making mats, [[rope]] and cordage, [[basket]]ry, rain hats, [[clothing]], and other soft goods. The harvesting of bark must be done with care because, if the tree is completely stripped, it will die. To prevent this, the harvester usually only harvests from trees which have not been stripped before.<ref name=\"stewart 116\">Stewart, p. 116</ref> After harvesting the tree is not used for bark again, although it may later be felled for wood. Stripping bark is usually started with a series of cuts at the base of the tree above any buttresses, after which the bark is peeled upwards. To remove bark high up, a pair of platforms strung on rope around the tree are used and the harvester climbs by alternating between them for support. Since redcedars lose their lower branches as all tall trees do in the rainforest, the harvester may climb {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} or more into the tree by this method. The harvested bark is folded and carried in backpacks.<ref name=\"stewart 115\">Stewart, p. 115</ref> It can be stored for quite some time as mold does not grow on it, and is moistened before unfolding and working. It is then split lengthwise into the required width and woven or twisted into shape. Bark harvesting was mostly done by women, despite the danger of climbing 10 meters in the air, because they were the primary makers of bark goods.<ref name=\"stewart 113\">Stewart, p. 113</ref>\n\nToday bark rope making is a lost art in many communities, although it is still practiced for decoration or art in a few places. Other uses of bark are still common for artistic or practical purposes. In recent years there has been a revival of cedar weaving in some communities, and along with it, new forms of cedar bark products. For example, in some recent weddings cedar roses are used to decorate the tables.\n\n==Legal status==\nWestern red cedar is export-restricted in the United States under the [[Export Administration Regulations]].\n\n== Health and safety ==\nWestern red cedar is highly allergenic and woodworkers or [[loggers]] who work with it may have adverse reactions, including the development of [[occupational asthma]], exacerbation of existing [[asthma]], reduction of [[lung function]], and eye irritation. Approximately 5% of workers are allergic to western red cedar. The US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has set a [[permissible exposure limit]] for red cedar dust of 2.5&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> as a time-weighted average over 8 hours.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pel88/WOODDUST.html|title = Wood Dust|date = 28 September 2011|accessdate = |website = |publisher = OSHA/NIOSH}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n* [[Cedar wood]]\n* [[List of superlative trees]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|24em}}\n\n==Works cited==\n{{refbegin|32em}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bitner|first=Richard L.|title=Conifers for Gardens: an Illustrated Encyclopedia|year=2007|publisher=Timber Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=0-88192-830-5}}\n*{{cite journal |author=Chedgy, Russell J. |author2=Young Woon Lim |author3=Colette Breuil |last-author-amp=yes |year=2009 |title=Effects of leaching on fungal growth and decay of western redcedar (''Thuja plicata'') |journal=[[Canadian Journal of Microbiology]] |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=578\u2013586 |pmid=19483786 |doi=10.1139/W08-161}}\n*{{cite book|last=DeCapua|first=Sarah|title=The Tlingit|series=First Americans|location=Tarrytown, New York|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Benchmark|year=2010|isbn=0-7614-4135-2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Dill|first=J.

It is also an important [[timber]] tree throughout the region, along with many of its large coniferous associates.<ref name=packee>{{Silvics |last=Packee |first=E.C. |genus=Tsuga |species=heterophylla |volume=1}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nWestern hemlock is a large [[evergreen]] [[pinophyta|coniferous]] [[tree]] growing to {{convert|165|\u2013|230|ft|m|round=5|abbr=on}} tall, exceptionally {{convert|273.42|ft|m|abbr=on}},<ref name=mdv>Tallest Hemlock, M. D. Vaden, Arborist: [http://www.mdvaden.com/hemlock_tallest.shtml ''Tallest known Hemlock, Tsuga heterophylla'']</ref> and with a trunk diameter of up to {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}}. It is the largest species of [[Tsuga|hemlock]], with the next largest ([[mountain hemlock]], ''T. mertensiana'') reaching a maximum of {{convert|194|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The [[bark]] is brown, thin and furrowed. The crown is a very neat broad conic shape in young trees with a strongly drooping lead shoot, becoming cylindric in older trees; old trees may have no branches in the lowest {{convert|100|\u2013|130|ft|m|round=5|abbr=on}}. At all ages, it is readily distinguished by the pendulous branchlet tips. The shoots are very pale buff-brown, almost white, with pale pubescence about {{convert|1|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, {{convert|5|\u2013|23|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2|mm|frac=64|abbr=on}} broad, strongly flattened in cross-section, with a finely [[serrate]]d margin and a bluntly acute apex. They are mid to dark green above; the underside has two distinctive white bands of [[stoma]]ta with only a narrow green midrib between the bands. They are arranged spirally on the shoots but are twisted at the base to lie in two ranks on either side of the shoot. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are small, pendulous, slender cylindrical, {{convert|14|\u2013|30|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|7|\u2013|8|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} broad when closed, opening to {{convert|18|\u2013|25|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} broad. They have 15\u201325 thin, flexible scales {{convert|7|\u2013|13|mm|frac=32|abbr=on}} long. The immature cones are green, maturing gray-brown 5\u20137 months after pollination. The [[seed]]s are brown, {{convert|2|\u2013|3|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long, with a slender, {{convert|7|\u2013|9|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long pale brown wing.<ref name=farjon /><ref name=gd />\n\n== Ecology ==\nWestern hemlock is closely associated with [[temperate rain forests]], and most of its range is less than {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. There is however an inland population in the [[Columbia Mountains]] in southeast [[British Columbia]], northern [[Idaho]] and western [[Montana]]. It mostly grows at low altitudes, from sea level to {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but up to {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the interior part of its range in Idaho.<ref name=farjon /><ref name=gd />\n\nIt is a very shade-tolerant tree; among associated species in the Pacific Northwest, it is matched or exceeded in shade tolerance only by [[Taxus brevifolia|Pacific yew]] and [[Abies amabilis|Pacific silver fir]].<ref name=packee />   Young plants typically grow up under the canopy of other conifers such as [[Sitka spruce]] or [[Douglas-fir]], where they can persist for decades waiting to exploit a gap in the canopy.  They eventually replace these conifers, which are relatively shade-intolerant, in climax forest. However, [[storm]]s and [[wildfire]]s will create larger openings in the forest where these other species can then regenerate.\n\nInitial growth is slow; one-year-old seedlings are commonly only {{convert|3|\u2013|5|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} tall, and two-year-old seedlings {{convert|10|\u2013|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} tall. Once established, saplings in full light may have an average growth rate of {{convert|50|\u2013|120|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} (rarely {{convert|140|cm|in|0|disp=comma|abbr=on}}) annually until they are {{convert|20|\u2013|30|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall, and in good conditions still {{convert|30|\u2013|40|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} annually when {{convert|40|\u2013|50|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall.  The tallest specimen, {{convert|82.83|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, is in [[Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park]], [[California]] (United States). It is long-lived, with trees over 1200 years old known.<ref name=gd />\n\nWestern hemlock forms [[ectomycorrhiza]]l associations with some well-known [[edible mushroom|edible fungi]] such as chanterelles (''[[Cantharellus formosus]]'', ''[[Cantharellus subalbidus|C. subalbidus]]'', and ''[[Craterellus tubaeformis]]'').<ref name=dun06 /><ref name=trappe04 />\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Tsuga heterophylla1.jpg|left|thumb|Young western hemlock]]\nWestern hemlock is the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].<ref>{{cite web |website=Washington State Government |url=http://www.leg.wa.gov/Legislature/StateSymbols/ |title=State Symbols}}</ref>\n\n=== Cultivation ===\nWestern hemlock is cultivated as an [[ornamental tree]] in gardens in its native habitats and along the U.S. Pacific Coast, where its best reliability is seen in wetter regions. In relatively dry areas, as at [[Victoria, British Columbia]], it is exacting about soil conditions. It needs a high level of organic matter (well-rotted wood from an old log or stump is best; animal manures may have too much [[nitrogen]] and [[salt]]), in a moist, acidic soil. It is also cultivated in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions worldwide.  It has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector \u2013 ''Tsuga heterophylla''|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1957|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Forestry ===\nWhen planted well upon the banks along a river, western hemlock can help to reduce erosion.\n\nOutside of its native range, western hemlock is of importance in [[forestry]] for timber and [[paper]] production, and as an [[ornamental tree]] in large [[garden]]s, in northwest Europe and southern New Zealand.\n\nIt has [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] in some parts of Great Britain and New Zealand, not so extensively as to be considered an [[invasive species]], but an [[introduced species]] tree.\n[[File:Tsuga heterophylla forest.jpg|thumb|right|''T. heterophylla'' often grows on [[coarse woody debris]] such as [[nurse log]]s and cut stumps]]\n\n=== Food ===\nThe edible [[Cork cambium|cambium]] can be collected by scraping slabs of removed bark. The resulting shavings can be eaten immediately, or can be dried and pressed into cakes for preservation. The bark also serves as a source of [[tannin]] for [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]].\n\nTender new growth needles (leaves) can be chewed directly or made into a bitter tea, rich in [[vitamin C]] (similar to some other hemlock and pine species).\n\nWestern hemlock boughs are used to collect [[herring]] eggs during the spring spawn in [[southeast Alaska]]. The boughs provide an easily collectible surface for the eggs to attach to as well as providing a distinctive taste. This practice originates from traditional gathering methods used by [[Alaska Natives|Native Alaskans]] from southeast Alaska, specifically the [[Tlingit people]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n\n* [[Tsuga canadensis]] the Eastern Hemlock\n\n== References ==\n{{commons+cat}}\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=trappe04>{{cite journal| journal=Mycologia|date=May\u2013Jun 2004| volume=96| issue=3| pages=498\u2013509| title=Habitat and host associations of ''Craterellus tubaeformis'' in northwestern Oregon| last=Trappe| first=MJ| pmid=21148873| url=http://www.mycologia.org/content/96/3/498.full| doi=10.2307/3762170}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=dun06>{{cite journal| title=Forest stand age and the occurrence of chanterelle (''Cantharellus'') species in Oregon\u2019s central Cascade Mountains| first=Susie M.| last=Dunham| first2=Thomas E.| last2=O'Dell| first3=Randy| last3=Molina| journal=Mycological Research| volume=110| year=2006| pages=1433\u201340| url=http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/bitstream/10113/13297/1/IND44024112.pdf| format=PDF| doi=10.1016/j.mycres.2006.09.007| pmid=17123812}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n[[Category:Pacific temperate rainforests ecoregion]]\n[[Category:Tsuga|heterophylla]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the West Coast of the United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Cascade Range]]\n[[Category:Trees of Alaska]]\n[[Category:Trees of British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of mild maritime climate]]\n[[Category:Least concern plants]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]\n[[Category:Trees of Subarctic America]]\n[[Category:Trees of Western Canada]]",

[[Arborescent]] individuals that have narrowly conical crowns until old age (300 to 400 years) and shrubby [[krummholz]] on cold, windy sites near timberline add beauty to mountain landscapes. Areas occupied by mountain hemlock generally have a cool to cold [[maritime climate]] that includes mild to cold winters, a short, warm-to-cool growing season and moderate to high precipitation.<ref name=silvics>{{Silvics |volume=1 |genus=Tsuga |species=mertensiana |first=Joseph E. |last=Means}}</ref>\n\nBest development of mountain hemlock is on loose, coarse-textured, well-drained soils with adequate moisture, and in [[British Columbia]], on thick and very acidic organic matter and decayed wood.<ref name=zone>{{cite book|last1=Brooke|first1=Robert C.|first2=E.

From southern British Columbia south, the tree grows better on northerly exposures. The preference for relatively moist, cool sites evidently becomes a necessity as the climate becomes more [[continental climate|continental]] in western Montana and more [[mediterranean climate|mediterranean]] in the central [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] at these extremes of its range.<ref name=Montana>{{cite journal|last=Habeck|first=James R.|year=1967|title=Mountain hemlock communities in western Montana|journal=Northwest Science|volume=41|issue=4|pages=169\u2013177}}</ref> In these locations, mountain hemlock typically grows in isolated populations in north-facing glens and [[cirque]] basins where snow collects and may remain well into summer.<ref name=silvics/>\n\nMountain hemlock is adapted to sites with long-lasting [[snowpack]]s. In the spring, mountain hemlocks emerging through {{convert|2|to|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} of snow were [[evapotranspiration|transpiring]], whereas nearby [[whitebark pine]]s did not transpire until the soil beneath them was free of snow.<ref name=silvics/> Mountain hemlock is well adapted to cope with heavy snow and ice loads, with tough branches and the drooping branchlets shedding snow readily.<ref name=gd/>\n\nMountain hemlock is tolerant of shade and other forms of competition.

J.|editor-last=Krajina|publisher=University of British Columbia, Department of Biology|location=Vancouver, BC}}</ref> Mountain hemlock is considered a minor climax species on most of its habitats; however, it pioneers on glacial moraines in British Columbia and Alaska. Pacific silver fir is a major climax species in many communities of the mountain hemlock forest in British Columbia and Washington and northern Oregon.<ref name=zone/><ref name=BC/> Alaska cedar, [[western redcedar]], and western hemlock are climax associates on some sites. Mountain hemlock is more commonly the major climax species in the mountain hemlock zone south of central Oregon where Pacific silver fir does not occur.<ref name=silvics/>\n\nMountain hemlock often succeeds [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]] or [[subalpine fir]] when these species pioneer on drier sites. It also tends to replace [[Picea engelmannii|Engelmann spruce]] when the two species occur together, possibly because hemlock is better able to withstand the [[Allelopathy|allelopathic]] effects of spruce than are other associated species.<ref name=silvics/>\n\n==Cultivation==\nOutside of its native range, mountain hemlock is grown as an [[ornamental tree]]. It is planted as a specimen tree in [[native plant]] [[landscape]]s in [[California]], and particularly in [[garden]]s in northern [[Great Britain]] and [[Scandinavia]], where it is appreciated for its blue\u2013green color and tolerance of severe weather.

The California Fan Palm Tree is also known as the Desert Fan Palm, American Cotton Palm and Arizona Fan Palm.\n\nThe [[frond]]s are up to {{convert|3.5|- |4|m|ft}} long, made up of a [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] up to {{convert|2|m|ft}} long, bearing a fan of leaflets {{convert|1.5|-|2|m|ft}} long. They have long thread-like white fibers and the petioles are pure green with yellow edges and ''filifera''-filaments, between the segments. The trunk is gray and tan and the leaves are gray green. When the fronds die they remain attached and drop down to cloak the trunk in a wide skirt. The shelter that the skirt creates provides a microhabitat for many small birds and invertebrates. If there is any red color present on petioles or trunk it is not a pure filifera but a fila-busta hybrid.\n\n''Washingtonia filifera'' can live from 80 to 250 years or more.\n\n==Ecology==\nDesert fan palms provide habitat for the giant palm boring beetle, western yellow bat, hooded oriole and many other bird species. Hooded orioles rely on the trees for food and places to build nests. Numerous insect species visit the hanging inflorescences that appear in late spring.<ref>Cornett, J. W. 1986.

Pan Pacific Entomologist 62(3):224-225.</ref>\n\n===Threats===\nThe palm boring beetle ''[[Dinapate wrightii]]'' ([[Bostrichidae]]) can chew through the trunks of this as well as other palms. Eventually a continued infestation of beetles can kill various genera and species of palms.

This may have kept palms restricted to a lesser range than indicated by the availability of water.\n\nToday's oasis environment may have been protected from colder climatic changes over the course of its evolution. Thus this palm is restricted by both water and climate to widely separated [[relict]] groves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xeri.com/Moapa/relict.htm|title=Desert Fan Palms-Evidence suggests \"Relict Genus\"|website=www.xeri.com|access-date=2016-12-10}}</ref> The trees in these groves show little if any genetic differentiation, (through electrophoretic examination) suggesting that the genus is genetically very stable.\n\n==Access==\n[[Joshua Tree National Park]] in the Mojave Desert preserves and protects healthy riparian palm habitat examples in the Little San Bernardino Mountains, and westward where water rises through the San Andreas Fault on the east valley side. In the central Coachella Valley the [[Indio Hills Palms|Indio Hills Palms State Reserve]] and nearby [[Coachella Valley National Wildlife Refuge|Coachella Valley Preserve]], other large oases are protected and accessible. The [[Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument]], and [[Anza-Borrego Desert State Park]] both have large and diverse ''W. filifera'' canyon oasis habitats.\n\n==Native Americans==\nThe fruit of the fan palm was eaten raw, cooked, or ground into flour for cakes.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cornett|first1=James W.|title=Indian Uses of Desert Plants|date=2011|publisher=Nature Trails Press|location=Palm Springs, California|isbn=978-0-937794-45-6|edition=Third}}</ref> The Cahuilla and related tribes used the leaves to make sandals, thatch roofs, and baskets.

The tree extends down to sea level in many areas, particularly in Oregon and Washington. It is the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[Idaho]], and is sometimes known as the '''Idaho pine'''.<ref name=\"Moore2008\">{{cite book |author1=Moore, Gerry |author2=Kershner, Bruce |author3=Craig Tufts |author4=Daniel Mathews |author5=Gil Nelson |author6=Spellenberg, Richard |author7=Thieret, John W. |author8=Terry Purinton |author9=Block, Andrew |title=National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Trees of North America |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |year=2008 |page=78 |isbn=1-4027-3875-7}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Pinus monticola0.jpg|thumb|left|Foliage and cones]]\n\nWestern white pine (''Pinus monticola'') is a large [[tree]], regularly growing to {{convert|30|\u2013|50|m|ft}} and exceptionally up to {{convert|70|m|ft}} tall. It is a member of the [[Pinus classification|white pine]] group, ''[[Pinus]]'' subgenus ''[[Strobus]]'', and like all members of that group, the leaves ('needles') are in [[Fascicle (botany)|fascicles]] (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. The needles are finely serrated, and {{convert|5|\u2013|13|cm|in}} long. The cones are long and slender, {{convert|12|\u2013|32|cm|in}} long and {{convert|3|\u2013|4|cm|in}} broad (closed), opening to {{convert|5|\u2013|8|cm|in}} broad; the scales are thin and flexible. The seeds are small, 4\u20137&nbsp;mm long, and have a long slender wing 15\u201322&nbsp;mm long.\n\nIt is related to the [[Eastern white pine]] (''Pinus strobus''), differing from it in having larger cones, slightly longer-lasting leaves (2\u20133 years, rather than 1.5\u20132 years) with more prominent [[stoma]]tal bands, and a somewhat denser and narrower habit. The branches are borne in regular whorls, produced at the rate of one a year; this is pronounced in narrow, stand-grown trees, while open specimens may have a more rounded form with wide-reaching limbs. It is widely grown as an [[ornamental tree]], but has been heavily logged throughout much of its range in the past.\n\n==Threats==\n[[File:Pinus monticola Umatilla.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Large ''P. monticola'']]\nWestern white pine  (''Pinus monticola'') has been seriously affected by the [[Cronartium ribicola|white pine blister rust]] (''Cronartium ribicola''), a fungus that was accidentally introduced from [[Europe]] in 1909. The [[United States Forest Service]] estimates that 90% of the Western white pines have been killed by the blister rust west of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]]. Large stands have been succeeded by other pines or non-pine species. The rust has also killed much of the [[Whitebark pine]] outside of [[California]]. Blister rust is less severe in California, and Western white and whitebark pines have survived there in great numbers.\n\nResistance to the blister rust is genetic, and due to Western white pine's genetic variability some individuals are relatively unaffected by the rust. The Forest Service has a program for locating and breeding rust-resistant Western white pine and [[sugar pine]]. Seedlings of these trees have been introduced into the wild. {{clear|left}}\n\n[[File:Western white pine.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Western white pine in [[St. Joe National Forest]].

This tree has a top-heavy branch system, but also what has been described as a \"deep and extensive\" root system, with roots reaching up to {{convert|11|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Gucker 2006\" /> If it survives the rigors of the desert, it can live for hundreds of years; some specimens survive a thousand years. The tallest trees reach about {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. New plants can grow from [[seed]], but in some populations, new stems grow from underground [[rhizome]]s that spread out around the parent tree.\n\nThe [[evergreen]] [[leaf|leaves]] are dark green, linear, bayonet-shaped, 15\u201335&nbsp;cm long and 7\u201315&nbsp;mm broad at the base, tapering to a sharp point; they are borne in a dense spiral arrangement at the apex of the stems.

The tepals are [[lanceolate]] and are fused to the middle. The fused [[pistil]]s are 3&nbsp;cm tall and the stigma cavity is surrounded by lobes. The semi-fleshy fruit that is produced is green-brown, elliptical, and contains many flat seeds. Joshua trees usually do not branch until after they bloom (though branching may also occur if the growing tip is destroyed by the yucca-boring [[weevil]]), and they do not bloom every year. Like most desert plants, their blooming depends on rainfall at the proper time. They also need a winter freeze before they bloom.\n\nOnce they bloom, the trees are pollinated by the [[yucca moth]], which spreads pollen while laying her eggs inside the flower. The [[moth]] [[larva]]e feed on the seeds of the tree, but enough seeds are left behind to produce more trees. The Joshua tree is also able to actively abort ovaries in which too many eggs have been laid.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n\n''Yucca brevifolia'' is [[endemism|endemic]] to the [[Southwestern United States]] with populations in western [[Arizona]], southeastern [[California]], southern [[Nevada]], and southwestern [[Utah]].

Gray\n|}}\n'''''Ziziphus obtusifolia''''' is a species of flowering plant in the [[Rhamnaceae|buckthorn family]] known by several common names, including '''lotebush''', '''graythorn''', '''gumdrop tree''', and '''Texas buckthorn'''.<ref name=fs>[http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/shrub/zizobt/all.html US Forest Service Fire Ecology]</ref> \n\n==Distribution==\nThe plant is native to the South Central and [[Southwestern United States]], the [[California]] deserts, and central through northern [[Mexico]]. <ref>[http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?105422 NPGS/GRIN information for ''Ziziphus obtusifolia'']</ref>\n\nIt grows in shrubby and scrubby [[desert]] habitats, [[grassland]]s and [[prairie]], woodlands, and other habitat types. It can be found among desert plants such as [[Prosopis glandulosa|honey mesquite]], [[Prosopis laevigata|smooth mesquite]], [[Fouquieria splendens|ocotillo]] and [[Larrea tridentata|creosote]].<ref name=fs/> \n\n==Description==\n''Ziziphus obtusifolia'' is a [[shrub]] with many branches forming a thorny tangle which may exceed {{convert|3|m|ft}} tall and approach {{convert|4|m|ft}}  at times. \n\nThe leaves are [[deciduous]] and are absent for much of the year, leaving the shrub a naked thicket of gray twigs coated in waxy whitish hairs. The ends of the twigs taper into sharp-tipped thorns. The thick, glandular gray or green leaves have oval blades 1 or 2 centimeters long. \n\nThe [[inflorescence]] is a cluster of several dull yellow-green flowers. The fruit is a mealy, juicy [[drupe]] containing one seed.\n\nThe fruit provides food for many species of birds and mammals.<ref name=fs/> Birds use the shrub as a nesting site and the [[southern plains woodrat]] uses the twigs to build its houses.<ref name=fs/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ZIOB USDA Plants Profile for ''Ziziphus obtusifolia'' (Lotebush)]\n*[http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-taxon=Ziziphus+obtusifolia CalFlora Database: ''Ziziphus obtusifolia'' (Lotebush)]\n*[http://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=ZIOB NPIN\u2212Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center Native Plant Information Network: ''Ziziphus obtusifolia'' (Lotebush, Lote-bush condalia)]\n*[http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-taxon=Ziziphus+obtusifolia+var.+canescens CalFlora Database: ''Ziziphus obtusifolia'' var.
