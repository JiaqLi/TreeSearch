Pinophytes are [[gymnosperms]]. They are [[Conifer cone|cone-bearing]] seed [[plant]]s with [[Vascular plant|vascular]] tissue; all extant conifers are [[woody plant]]s, the great majority being [[tree]]s with just a few being [[shrub]]s. Typical examples of conifers include [[Cedrus|cedar]]s, [[Douglas-fir]]s, [[Cupressaceae|cypresses]], [[fir]]s, [[juniper]]s, [[Agathis|kauris]], [[larch]]es, [[pine]]s, [[Tsuga|hemlock]]s, [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]]s, [[spruce]]s, and [[Taxaceae|yew]]s.<ref name=campbell>Campbell, Reece, \"Phylum Coniferophyta.\"Biology. 7th. 2005.

It is also commonly referred to as the '''white fir''', '''red fir''', '''lovely fir''', '''Amabilis fir''', '''Cascades fir''', or '''silver fir'''.<ref name=\"GDB\">[http://www.conifers.org/pi/Abies_amabilis.php ''Abies amabilis''], The Gymnosperm Database. Accessed 31 July 2012.</ref> It grows at altitudes of sea level to {{convert|1500|m}} in the north of the range, and {{convert|1000|-|2300|m|abbr=on}} in the south of the range, always in [[temperate rain forest]] with relatively high precipitation and cool, humid summers. Common associate trees are [[Douglas fir]] and in the extreme southern area of its range, [[California buckeye]].<ref>C.M. Hogan, 2008</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:PacificSilverFir 7645.jpg|left|210px|thumb|Pacific silver fir bark]]\n[[File:Abama-twig.jpg|left|thumb|210px|Close-up of shoot from below, showing shoot pubescence and white stomatal bands]]\nIt is a large [[evergreen]] [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] [[tree]] growing to {{convert|30|\u2013|45|m|abbr=on}}, exceptionally {{convert|72|m|abbr=on}} tall,<ref>Gymnosperm database, 2008</ref> and with a trunk diameter of up to {{convert|1.2|m|abbr=on}}, exceptionally {{convert|2.3|m|abbr=on}}. The [[bark]] on younger trees is light grey, thin and covered with [[resin]] blisters. On older trees, it darkens and develops scales and furrows. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, flattened, {{convert|2|-|4.5|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|mm|abbr=on}} wide by {{convert|0.5|mm|abbr=on|2}} thick, matte dark green above, and with two white bands of [[stomata]] below, and slightly notched at the tip.<ref>Flora of North America, 2008</ref> The leaf arrangement is spiral on the shoot, but with each leaf variably twisted at the base so they lie flat to either side of and above the shoot, with none below the shoot. The shoots are orange-red with dense velvety pubescence. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are {{convert|9|\u2013|17|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4|\u2013|6|cm|abbr=on}} broad, dark purple before maturity; the scale bracts are short, and hidden in the closed cone. The winged [[seed]]s are released when the cones disintegrate at maturity about 6\u20137 months after pollination.\n\nPacific silver fir is very closely related to [[Maries' fir]] ''A. mariesii'' from [[Japan]], which is distinguished by its slightly shorter leaves\u2014{{convert|1.5|-|2.5|cm|abbr=on}}\u2014and smaller cones, which are {{convert|5|\u2013|11|cm|abbr=on}} long.\n\n==Uses==\nThe [[wood]] is soft and not very strong; it is used for [[paper]] making, packing crates and other cheap construction work. The foliage has an attractive scent and is sometimes used for [[Christmas]] decoration, including [[Christmas tree]]s.\n\nIt is also planted as an [[ornamental tree]] in large parks, though its requirement for cool, humid summers limits the areas where it grows well; successful growth away from its native range is restricted to areas like western [[Scotland]] and southern [[New Zealand]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:PacificSilverFir_7644.jpg|Foliage bottom\nFile:PacificSilverFir_7785.jpg|Foliage top\nFile:Abies amabilis 26395.JPG|Cone growth\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*{{IUCN2013.2| assessor=Farjon, A.| year=2013| id= 42271| title=Abies amabilis| downloaded=2 May 2014}}\n*[http://www.conifers.org/pi/Abies_amabilis.php Gymnosperm Database: ''Abies amabilis'' (2011)]\n*[http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_info.asp?thingid=82383 C.Michael Hogan (2008) ''Aesculus californica'', Globaltwitcher.com, ed.

''concolor'']]\nAs treated here, there are two [[subspecies]]; these are also variously treated at either the lower rank of [[variety (biology)|variety]] by some authors, or as distinct [[species]] by others:\n\n====''Abies concolor'' subsp. ''concolor''====\n* '''''Abies concolor'' subsp. ''concolor''''' \u2014 '''Colorado white fir''' or '''Rocky Mountains white fir'''. In the [[United States]], at altitudes of {{convert|1700|\u2013|3400|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the [[Rocky Mountains]] from southern [[Idaho]], south through [[Utah]] and [[Colorado]], to [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]], and on the higher [[Great Basin]] mountains of [[Nevada]] and extreme southeastern [[California]], and a short distance into northern [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]]. A smaller tree to {{convert|25|\u2013|35|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall, rarely {{convert|45|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}}. Foliage strongly upcurved to erect on all except weak shaded shoots in the lower crown; leaves mostly {{convert|3.5|\u2013|6|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}}, and strongly glaucous on the upper side with numerous stomata. Tolerates winter [[temperature]]s down to about {{convert|-40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.\n\n====''Abies concolor'' subsp. ''lowiana''====\n* '''''Abies concolor'' subsp. ''lowiana''''' ([[syn.]] ''Abies lowiana'') \u2014 '''Low's white fir''' or '''Sierra Nevada white fir'''. In the [[United States]], at altitudes of {{convert|900|\u2013|2700|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] of central [[Oregon]] south through [[California]] ([[Klamath Mountains]], [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]) to northern [[Baja California]], [[Mexico]]. A larger tree to {{convert|40|\u2013|60|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall. Foliage flattened on lower crown shoots, the leaves often raised above the shoot on upper crown shoots but not often strongly upcurved; leaves mostly {{convert|2.5|\u2013|5|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}}, and only weakly glaucous on the upper side with few or no stomata. Tolerates winter temperatures down to about {{convert|-30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Related species===\nWhite fir is very closely related to [[grand fir]] (''Abies grandis''), with subspecies ''lowiana'' being particularly similar to the interior variety of grand fir ''A. grandis'' var. ''idahoensis'', intergrading with it where they meet in the Cascades of central Oregon. To the south in Mexico, it is replaced by further close relatives, [[Durango fir]] (''A. durangensis'') and [[Mexican fir]] (''A. mexicana'').\n...\n\n==Forest succession==\nWhite fir, being shade tolerant, is a [[climax species]] in forest succession in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and in the presence of modern human controls against forest fires, it has flourished over the past two centuries. It is sometimes regarded as a pest by those in the lumber industry, as it drives out trees of greater stature (such as the [[sugar pine]] and [[incense cedar]]), has weaker, knottier wood than its competitors, and retains its lower limbs. This latter trait creates a fire ladder that allows flames to reach up to the canopy, thinning out [[giant sequoia]] stands that would escape smaller forest fires with minimal damage.<ref>[http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/science/hartesveldt/chap6.htm The Giant Sequoia of the Sierra Nevada] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022031750/http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/science/hartesveldt/chap6.htm |date=October 22, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n== Discovery ==\nThis tree was discovered by [[William Lobb]] on his expedition to California of 1849\u20131853, having been overlooked previously by [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]].<ref>{{cite book | author= Toby Musgrave | author2= Chris Gardner | author3= Will Musgrave | last-author-amp= yes | title=The Plant Hunters| publisher=[[Orion Publishing Group|Seven Dials]] | year=1999|page=147| isbn=1-84188-001-9}}</ref><ref>Hildebrand, Friedrich Hermann Gustav.

It is a major constituent of the [[Ecology of the North Cascades#Grand Fir/Douglas Fir ecoregion|Grand Fir/Douglas Fir Ecoregion]] of the [[Cascade Range]].\n\nThe tree typically grows to 40\u201370 m in height. There are two [[variety (biology)|varieties]], the taller '''coast grand fir,''' found west of the Cascade Mountains, and the shorter '''interior grand fir''', found east of the Cascades. It was first described in 1831 by [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]].<ref name=\"whitefir\"/>\n\nIt is closely related to [[white fir]]. The bark has historical medicinal properties, and it is popular in the United States as a [[Christmas tree]]. Its [[lumber]] is a [[softwood]], and it is harvested as a '''hem fir'''. It is used in paper-making, as well as construction for [[Framing (construction)|framing]] and flooring, where it is desired for its resistance to splitting and splintering.\n\n==Description==\n{{double image|left|Abies grandis 5357.JPG|203|Abies grandis 5359.JPG|90|The bottom (left) and top (right) of the foliage}}\nThe grand fir was first described by Scottish botanical explorer [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]], who in 1831 collected specimens of the tree along the [[Columbia River]] in the [[Pacific Northwest]].<ref name=\"whitefir\"/>\n\n''Abies grandis'' is a large [[evergreen]] [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] [[tree]] growing to 40&ndash;70&nbsp;m (exceptionally 100&nbsp;m) tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 2&nbsp;m. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, flattened, 3\u20136&nbsp;cm long and 2&nbsp;mm wide by 0.5&nbsp;mm thick, glossy dark green above, and with two green-white bands of [[stomata]] below, and slightly notched at the tip. The leaf arrangement is spiral on the shoot, but with each leaf variably twisted at the base so they all lie in two more-or-less flat ranks on either side of the shoot. On the lower leaf surface, two green-white bands of stomata are prominent. The base of each leaf is twisted a variable amount so that the leaves are nearly [[Coplanarity|coplanar]]. Different length leaves, but all lined up in a flat plane, is a useful way to quickly distinguish this species. [[File:Abies grandis cones.jpg|thumb|left|Cones]] The [[conifer cone|cones]] are 6&ndash;12&nbsp;cm long and 3.5&ndash;4.5&nbsp;cm broad, with about 100-150 scales; the scale bracts are short, and hidden in the closed cone. The winged [[seed]]s are released when the cones disintegrate at maturity about 6 months after pollination.<ref name=\"one\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Varieties===\n[[File:Abies grandis oldtrees.jpg|300px|thumb|left|[[Old-growth]] copse in inland [[Oregon]]]]\nThere are two [[variety (biology)|varieties]], probably better treated at [[subspecies]] rank though not yet formally published as such:\n* ''Abies grandis'' var. ''grandis''. '''Coast grand fir'''. Coastal lowland forests, at sea level to 900&nbsp;m altitude, from [[Vancouver Island]] and coastal [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], south to [[Sonoma County, California]], [[United States]]. A large, very fast-growing tree to 70 m tall. Foliage strongly flattened on all shoots. Cones slightly narrower (mostly less than 4&nbsp;cm broad), with thinner, fairly flexible scales. Tolerates winter [[temperature]]s down to about -25\u00b0 to -30&nbsp;\u00b0C; growth on good sites may exceed 1.5&nbsp;m per year when young.<ref name=\"one\"/>\n* ''Abies grandis'' var. ''idahoensis''. '''Interior grand fir'''. Interior forests, at (600&ndash;) 900&ndash;1800&nbsp;m altitude, on the east slope of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and northern [[Oregon]] and in the [[Rocky Mountains]] from southeast [[British Columbia]] south to central [[Idaho]], northeast [[Oregon]] and western [[Montana]]. A smaller, slow-growing tree to 40\u201345&nbsp;m tall. Foliage not strongly flattened on all shoots, the leaves often raised above the shoot, particularly on upper crown shoots. Cones slightly stouter (mostly over 4&nbsp;cm broad), with thicker, slightly woody scales. Tolerates winter temperatures down to about -40&nbsp;\u00b0C; growth on good sites not exceeding 0.6&nbsp;m per year even when young.<ref name=\"one\"/>\n\nGrand fir is very closely related to [[white fir]], with the interior variety ''idahoensis'' particularly similar to the western forms of white fir from western Oregon and California, intergrading with it where they meet in the Cascades of central Oregon.<ref name=\"one\"/>\n\n==Uses==\nThe inner bark of the grand fir was used by some [[Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau|Plateau Indian]] tribes for treating [[common cold|cold]]s and [[fever]].<ref name=\"hunn\"/> The foliage has an attractive [[citrus]]-like scent, and is sometimes used for [[Christmas]] decorations in the United States, including [[Christmas tree]]s. It is also planted as an ornamental tree in large parks.\n\n===Timber===\n[[File:Abies grandis cross section.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Trunk cross-section]]\nThe lumber is non-resinous and fine textured.<ref name=\"whitefir\"/>\nIn the North American [[logging]] industry, the grand fir is often referred to as \"hem fir\", with hem fir being a blanket term that can be applied to a number of species with interchangeable types of wood (specifically the [[Abies magnifica|California red fir]], [[noble fir]], [[Pacific silver fir]], [[white fir]], and [[western hemlock]]). Grand fir is often shipped along with these other species. It can also referred to as \"white fir\" lumber, an umbrella term also referring to ''[[Abies amabilis]]'', ''[[Abies concolor]]'', and ''[[Abies magnifica]]''.\n\n[[Lumber]] from the grand fir is considered a [[softwood]]. As such, it is used for [[paper]] making, packing crates, and construction. Hem fir is frequently used for [[Framing (construction)|framing]], and is able to meet the [[building code]] [[Span (architecture)|span requirements]] of numerous construction projects.<ref name=\"hefir\"/>\n\nAs a hem fir, the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] of the grand fir is considered slightly below the \"[[Douglas fir]]-[[larch]]\" species combination in strength, and stronger than the \"Douglas fir-South\" and \"spruce-pine-fir (South)\" species combos (both umbrella terms for a number of species with similar wood). Because it is nearly as strong as Douglas fir-larch, it often meets the structural [[load-bearing wall|load-bearing]] requirements for framing in residential, light commercial, and heavy construction. Excluding Douglas fir-larch, hem fir's [[modulus of elasticity]] value as a stiffness factor in floor systems (denoted as MOE or E) is stronger than all other western species combinations. Hem fir is preferred by many builders because of its ability to hold and not be split by nails and screws, and its low propensity for splintering when sawed.<ref name=\"hefir\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist| refs =\n<ref name=\"whitefir\">{{cite news\n| title       = Brochure: White Fir Facts\n| first       = \n| last        = \n| url         = http://www.spi-ind.com/html/documents/brochure-WhiteFirFacts.pdf\n| newspaper   = \n| publisher   = SPI\n| date        = \n| accessdate  = 2012-01-12\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"hunn\">{{cite book |last= Hunn |first= Eugene S. |title= Nch'i-Wana, \"The Big River\": Mid-Columbia Indians and Their Land |publisher=[[University of Washington Press]] |year= 1990 |isbn= 0-295-97119-3| page=351}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"hefir\">{{cite news\n| title       = Hem-Fir species group\n| url         = http://www2.wwpa.org/SPECIESPRODUCTS/HemFir/tabid/299/Default.aspx#char\n| publisher   = Western Woods Products Association\n| date        = March 1997\n| accessdate  = 2012-07-10\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"one\">{{IUCN2006|assessor=Conifer Specialist Group|year=1998|id=42284|title=Abies grandis|downloaded=12 May 2006}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Abies grandis}}\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*[http://www.conifers.org/pi/Abies_grandis.php Gymnosperm Database: ''Abies grandis'']\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ABGR USDA Plants Profile of ''Abies grandis'' (grand fir)]\n*[http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/abies-grandis-grand-fir-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map of ''Abies grandis'']\n*[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_IJM.pl?tid=11526  Jepson eFlora: ''Abies grandis'']\n*[http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-taxon=Abies+grandis CalFlora Database: ''Abies grandis'' (grand fir)]\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Abies grandis}}\n[[Category:Abies|grandis]]\n[[Category:Trees of the West Coast of the United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Cascade Range]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Klamath Mountains]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Rocky Mountains]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the California Coast Ranges]]\n[[Category:Trees of mild maritime climate]]\n[[Category:Trees of humid continental climate]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of California]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]",

''bifolia'', or not distinguished from typical ''A. lasiocarpa'' at all. It occurs in the [[Rocky Mountains]] from southeast Alaska (eastern [[Alaska Range]]) south to Colorado. It differs primarily in [[resin]] composition, and in the fresh leaf scars being yellow-brown, not reddish. The ''Flora of North America'' treats it as a distinct species (see external links, below); the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] includes it within ''A. lasiocarpa'' without distinction.\n*The '''corkbark fir''' ''Abies lasiocarpa'' var. ''arizonica'' occurs in Arizona and New Mexico. It differs in thicker, [[Cork (material)|corky]] [[bark]] and more strongly glaucous foliage. In resin composition it is closer to ''A. bifolia'' than to typical ''A. lasiocarpa'', though the combination \"Abies bifolia var. arizonica\" has not been formally published. The ''Flora of North America'' includes it within ''A. bifolia'' without distinction; the USDA treats it as a distinct variety of ''A. lasiocarpa''.

It is a high elevation tree, typically occurring at {{convert|1400|-|2700|m|ft}} elevation, though only rarely reaching [[tree line]]. The name red fir derives from the [[bark]] color of old trees.\n\n==Description==\n''Abies magnifica'' is a large [[evergreen]] [[tree]] typically up to {{convert|40|-|60|m|ft}} tall and {{convert|2|m|ft}} trunk diameter, rarely to {{convert|76.5|m|ft}} tall and {{convert|3|m|ft}} diameter, with a narrow conic crown. The [[bark]] on young trees is smooth, grey, and with [[resin]] blisters, becoming orange-red, rough and fissured on old trees. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, 2-3.5&nbsp;cm long, glaucous blue-green above and below with strong [[stomata]]l bands, and an acute tip. They are arranged spirally on the shoot, but twisted slightly s-shaped to be upcurved above the shoot.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|cones]] are erect, 9\u201321&nbsp;cm long, yellow-green (occasionally purple), ripening brown and disintegrating to release the winged [[seed]]s in fall.\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"left\"\n| [[Image:Abies magnifica 8016t.jpg|left|thumb|''Abies magnifica'': Cones stand upright on branches]]\n|-\n| [[Image:Abies magnifica 8009.jpg|left|thumb|''Abies magnifica'': Needle-like leaves bend upward]]\n|}\n\n===Varieties===\nThere are two, perhaps three varieties:\n* '''''Abies magnifica'' var. ''magnifica''''', '''red fir''' \u2014 cones large (14\u201321&nbsp;cm), cone bract scales short, not visible on the closed cones. Most of the species' range, primarily in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].\n* '''''Abies magnifica'' var. ''shastensis''''', '''Shasta red fir''' \u2014 cones large (14\u201321&nbsp;cm), cone bract scales longer, visible on the closed cone. The northwest of the species' range, in southwest Oregon and [[Shasta County, California|Shasta]], [[Siskiyou County, California|Siskiyou]] and [[Trinity County, California|Trinity]] Counties in northwest California.\n* ''A. magnifica'' on the eastern slopes of southern Sierra Nevada  \u2014 possibly a third variety, have not been formally named, also having long bracts, and additionally have smaller cones, 9\u201315&nbsp;cm long.\n\n===Related===\nRed fir is very closely related to [[noble fir]] (''Abies procera''), which replaces it further north in the [[Cascade Range]]. They are best distinguished by the leaves; noble fir leaves have a groove along the midrib on the upper side, while red fir does not show this. Red fir also tends to have the leaves less closely packed, with the shoot bark visible between the leaves, whereas the shoot is largely hidden in noble fir. Some botanists treat ''Abies magnifica'' var. ''shastensis'' as a natural hybrid between red fir and noble fir.\n\n==Discovery==\nThis tree was discovered by [[William Lobb]] on his expedition to California of 1849 \u2013 1853, having been overlooked previously by [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]].<ref>{{cite book | author= Toby Musgrave | author2= Chris Gardner | author3= Will Musgrave | last-author-amp= yes | title=The Plant Hunters| publisher=[[Orion Publishing Group|Seven Dials]] | year=1999|page=147| isbn=1-84188-001-9}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nThe [[wood]] is used for general structural purposes and [[paper]] manufacture.

The [[bark]] is dark brown to gray, with narrow fissures and flat ridges creating plate-like scales; it is thin and easily damaged. The [[leaf|leaves]] are opposite, simple, 6\u201312&nbsp;cm long and broad, with three to five deep, bluntly-pointed lobes, three of the lobes large and two small ones (not always present) at the leaf base; the three major lobes each have 3\u20135 small subsidiary lobules. The leaves turn golden yellow to red in fall (this trait is less reliable in warmer areas).\n\nThe [[flower]]s appear with the leaves in mid spring; they are produced in [[corymb]]s of 5\u201315 together, each flower yellow-green, about 4\u20135&nbsp;mm diameter, with no petals. The [[fruit]] is a paired samara (two winged [[seed]]s joined at the base), green to reddish-pink in color, maturing brown in early fall; each seed is globose, 7\u201310&nbsp;mm diameter, with a single wing 2\u20133&nbsp;cm long.\n\n[[Image:Red leaves (Acer grandidentatum) - Little Cottonwood Canyon, Utah (2003).jpg|left|180px]]\nIt commonly grows in [[limestone]] soils but can adapt to a wide range of well-drained soils, from sand to clays to even white limestone areas. It prefers sheltered canyons, valleys, and the banks of mountain streams, primarily at higher elevations but occasionally at lower elevations in disjunct locales such as the southern edge of the [[Edwards Plateau]] in [[Texas]] and in the [[Wichita Mountains]] of [[southwestern Oklahoma]]. Although [[continental climate]]s prevail over all of its natural range, it grows well in the [[maritime climate]] of [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]]. It is slow growing when young, and does not have many pests.\n\nIt is occasionally planted as an ornamental tree, valued for its drought tolerance and ability to grow in rocky landscapes.\n\nOther vernacular names occasionally used include lost maple, Sabinal maple, western sugar maple, Uvalde big tooth maple, canyon maple, southwestern big tooth maple, plateau big tooth maple, limerock maple, Wasatch maple and Rocky Mountain sugar maple.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lost Maples State Natural Area]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{commons|Acer grandidentatum}}\n\n[[Category:Acer|grandidentatum]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Rocky Mountains]]",

It often has several trunks and can form impenetrable thickets.<ref name=\"gelderen\">van Gelderen, C.J. & van Gelderen, D.M. (1999). ''Maples for Gardens: A Color Encyclopedia''.</ref>\n\nThe shoots are green, often with a whitish to pink or violet [[wax]]y coating when young.  Branches are smooth, somewhat brittle, and tend to retain a fresh green colour rather than forming a [[bark]] of dead, protective tissue.  The bark on its trunks is pale gray or light brown, deeply cleft into broad ridges, and scaly.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nUnlike most other maples (which usually have [[simple leaf|simple]], [[palmate]]ly [[lobed leaf|lobed]] [[leaf|leaves]]), ''Acer negundo'' has [[pinnate]]ly [[compound leaf|compound]] leaves that usually have three to seven leaflets.  Simple leaves are also occasionally present;  technically, these are single-leaflet compound leaves.  Although some other maples (such as ''[[Acer griseum]]'', ''[[Acer mandshuricum]]'' and the closely related [[Acer cissifolium|''A. cissifolium'']]) have [[leaf shape|trifoliate]] leaves, only ''A. negundo'' regularly displays more than three leaflets.\n\nThe leaflets are about {{convert|5|-|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}} long and {{convert|3|-|7|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} wide with slightly serrate margins.  Leaves have a [[translucence|translucent]] light green color and turn yellow in the [[Autumn|fall]].\n\nThe [[flower]]s are small and appear in early spring on drooping [[raceme]]s {{convert|10|-|20|cm|in|0|sp=us}} long.  The [[fruit]]s are paired [[Samara (fruit)|samaras]], each seed slender, {{convert|1|-|2|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long, with a {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} incurved wing; they drop in autumn or they may persist through winter.  Seeds are usually both prolific and [[fertility|fertile]].\n\nUnlike most other maples, ''A. negundo'' is fully [[dioecious]] and both a male and female tree are needed for either to reproduce.\n\n* Winter buds: Terminal buds acute, an eighth of an inch long.  Lateral buds obtuse.  The inner scales enlarge when spring growth begins and often become an inch long before they fall.\n* Flowers: April, before the leaves, yellow green; staminate flowers in clusters on slender hairy pedicels one and a half to two inches long.  Pistillate flowers in narrow drooping racemes.\n* Calyx: Yellow green; staminate flowers campanulate, five-lobed, hairy.  Pistillate flowers smaller, five-parted; disk rudimentary.\n* Corolla: Wanting.\n* Stamens: Four to six, exserted; filaments slender, hairy; anthers linear, connective pointed.\n* Pistil: Ovary hairy, borne on disk, partly enclosed by calyx, two-celled, wing-margined.  Styles separate at base into two stigmatic lobes.\n* Fruit: Maple keys, full size in early summer.  Borne in drooping racemes, pedicels one to two inches long.  Key an inch and a half to two inches long, nutlets diverging, wings straight or incurved.  September.  Seed half an inch long.  Cotyledons, thin, narrow.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\n=== Subspecies ===\n[[File:Acer negundo.jpg|thumb|right|''A. negundo'' leaves and fruits]]\n\n''Acer negundo'' is often discussed as comprising three subspecies, each of which was originally described as a separate species.  These are:\n\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''negundo'' is the main variety and the type to which characteristics described in the article most universally apply.  Its natural range is from the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] to the Rocky Mountains.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''interius'' has more leaf serration than the main species and a more [[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]] leaf surface.  As the name ''interus'' indicates, its natural range of [[Saskatchewan]] to [[New Mexico]] is sandwiched between that of the other two subspecies.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''californicum'' has larger leaves than the main species.  Leaves also have a velvety texture which is essential to distinguish it from ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''negundo''.  It is found in parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]].<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n\nSome authors further subdivide subsp. ''negundo'' into a number of regional varieties but these intergrade and their maintenance as distinct [[taxa]] is disputed by many.  Even the differences between recognized subspecies are probably a matter of gradient [[speciation]].\n\nFinally, note that a few botanists treat boxelder maple as its own distinct genus (''Negundo aceroides'') but this is not widely accepted.\n\n== Distribution ==\nAs noted, varieties thrive across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It may also be found as far south as [[Guatemala]].\n\nAlthough native to [[North America]], it is considered an [[invasive species]] in some areas of that continent. It can quickly [[colonize]] both cultivated and uncultivated areas and the range is therefore expanding both in North America and elsewhere. In Europe where it was introduced in 1688 as a park tree it is able to spread quickly in places and is considered an invasive species in parts of Central Europe (Germany and the Czech Republic, middle Danube, Vistula river valley in Poland) where it can form mass growth in lowlands, disturbed areas and riparian biomes on calcareous soils. It has also become [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] in eastern [[China]]<ref name=\"gelderen\" />  and can be found in some of the cooler areas of the [[Australian continent]] where it is listed as a pest [[invasive species]].\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Acer negundo tree.jpg|thumb|Boxelder, Manitoba Maple. Tree. ND, USA.]]\n\nThis species prefers bright sunlight. It often grows on flood plains and other disturbed areas with ample water supply, such as [[riparian]] habitats. Human influence has greatly favoured this species; it grows around houses and in hedges, as well as on disturbed ground and vacant lots.\n\nSeveral [[bird]]s and some [[squirrel]]s feed on the seeds.  The [[evening grosbeak]] uses them extensively. The [[Maple Bug]] (also known as the Boxelder Bug) lays its [[egg]]s on all maples, but prefers this species.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nAlthough its weak wood, irregular form, and prolific seeding might make it seem like a poor choice for a landscape tree, ''A. negundo'' is one of the most common maples in cultivation and many interesting [[cultivar]]s have been developed, including:<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* 'Auratum'&nbsp;\u2013 yellowish leaves with smooth undersides\n* 'Aureomarginatum'&nbsp;\u2013 creamy yellow leaf margins\n* 'Baron'&nbsp;\u2013 Hardier & seedless variety\n* 'Elegans'&nbsp;\u2013 distinctively convex leaves\n* 'Flamingo'&nbsp;\u2013 pink and white [[variegation]] (very popular)\n* [[Acer negundo 'Pendulum'|'Pendulum']]&nbsp;\u2013 with weeping branches.\n* 'Variegatum'&nbsp;\u2013 creamy white leaf margins\n* 'Violaceum'&nbsp;\u2013 younger shoots and branches have bluish colour\n\n== Uses ==\nAlthough its light, close-grained, soft wood is considered undesirable for most uses, this tree has been considered as a commercial source of wood fiber, for use in [[fiberboard]].\n\nThere is some commercial use of the tree for various decorative applications, such as turned items (bowls, stem-ware, pens). Primarily burl wood and injured wood, where the primary reason is this wood's reaction to injury, where the injured wood develops a red stain.\n\n=== Use by Native Americans ===\nThe [[Navajo people|Navajo]] use the wood to make tubes for bellows.<ref>Elmore, Francis H. 1944 Ethnobotany of the Navajo.

This design pre-dates the earliest extant [[Native American flute]] (which use a two-chambered design) by approximately 1,200 years.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Philips, Roger.

The official tallest red alder (1979) stands {{convert|32|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall in [[Clatsop County, Oregon]] (USA). The name derives from the bright rusty red color that develops in bruised or scraped bark. The bark is mottled, ashy-gray and smooth, often draped with [[moss]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] are ovate, {{convert|7|to|15|cm|in}} long, with bluntly serrated edges and a distinct point at the end; the leaf margin is revolute, the very edge being curled under, a diagnostic character which distinguishes it from all other alders. The leaves turn yellow in the autumn before falling. The male [[flower]]s are dangling reddish [[catkin]]s {{convert|10|to|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} long in early spring, and female flowers are erect catkins which develop into small, woody, superficially [[conifer cone|cone]]-like oval dry [[fruit]] {{convert|2|to|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The [[seed]]s develop between the woody bracts of the 'cones' they are shed in the autumn and winter.\n\n==Distribution==\n''Alnus rubra'' grows from southeast [[Alaska]] south to central coastal [[California]], nearly always within about {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the [[Pacific]] coast, except for an extension {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}} inland across [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]] into northernmost [[Montana]].<ref name=asdadadadada/>\n\n==Ecology==\n[[Image:RedAlder 7504.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Red alder, western hemlock and bigleaf maple forest]]\nIn southern [[Alaska]], western [[British Columbia]] and the northwestern [[Coast Ranges]] of the United States, red alder grows on cool and moist slopes; inland and at the southern end of its range (California) it grows mostly along the margins of watercourses and wetlands.\n\n===Commonly associated trees===\nRed alder is associated with [[coast Douglas-fir]] ''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' subsp. ''menziesii'', [[western hemlock]] ''Tsuga heterophylla'', [[Abies grandis|grand fir]] ''Abies grandis'', [[Thuja plicata|western redcedar]] ''Thuja plicata'', and [[Sitka spruce]] ''Picea sitchensis'' forests.\n\nAlong streambanks it is commonly associated with [[willow]]s ''Salix'' spp., [[red osier dogwood]] ''Cornus stolonifera'', [[Oregon ash]] ''Fraxinus latifolia'' and [[bigleaf maple]] ''Acer macrophyllum''.\n\n===In marginal habitat===\nTo the southeast of its range it is replaced by [[Alnus rhombifolia|white alder]] (''Alnus rhombifolia''), which is closely related but differs in the leaf margins not being rolled under. In the high mountains it is replaced by the smaller [[Green Alder|Sitka alder]] (''Alnus viridis'' subsp. ''sinuata''), and east of the [[Cascade Mountains]] by [[Grey Alder|thinleaf alder]] (''Alnus incana'' subsp. ''tenuifolia'').\n\n===As pioneer species===\nIn moist forest areas ''Alnus rubra'' will rapidly cover a former burn or [[clearcutting|clearcut]], temporarily preventing the growth of [[conifer]]s but also improving soil fertility for future growth of conifers. It is a prolific seed producer, but the seeds require an open area of mineral [[soil]] to [[Germination|germinate]], and so skid trails and other areas disturbed by logging or fire are ideal seedbeds. Such areas may host several hundred thousand to several million seedlings per hectare in the first year after landscape disturbance (Zavitkovski & Stevens, 1972).\n\n===Role as wildlife fodder===\nTwigs and buds of alder are only fair browse for wildlife, though [[deer]] and [[Red Deer|elk]] do browse the twigs in fall and twigs and buds in the winter and spring. [[Beaver]]s eat the bark. Several [[finch]]es eat alder seeds, notably [[common redpoll]] and [[pine siskin]], and as do [[deer mouse|deer mice]].\n\n===As soil enricher===\n''Alnus rubra'' is also very valuable for playing host to the [[nitrogen fixing]] [[actinomycete]] ''[[Frankia]]''. It is this ability which allows alder to grow in [[nitrate]]-poor soils.\n\n==Uses==\n[[Image:Alnus rubra 28199.JPG|right|thumb|Broken branch showing red weathered bark]]\n[[Image:Alder showing ozone discolouration.jpg|thumb|right|Red Alder leaf, showing the typical discolouration caused by [[ozone]] pollution.]]\n\n===As dye===\nA russet dye can be made from a decoction of the bark and was used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] to dye fishing nets so as to make them less visible underwater.\n\n===Traditional  medicine usage===\nNative Americans used red alder bark ''(Alnus rubra)'' to treat poison oak, insect bites, and skin irritations.  Blackfeet Indians used an infusion made from the bark of red alder to treat lymphatic disorders and tuberculosis.  Recent clinical studies have verified that red alder contains [[betulin]] and [[lupeol]], compounds shown to be effective against a variety of [[tumor]]s.<ref>Edible and Medicinal Plants of the West, Gregory L. Tilford, ISBN 0-87842-359-1</ref>\n\n===In restoration===\n''Alnus rubra'' is an important [[forestry]] tree. Its rapid growth makes it useful in covering disturbed land, such as [[Mining|mine]] spoils. Alder leaves, shed in the fall, decay readily to form a [[nitrogen]]-enriched [[humus]]. It is being considered as a [[crop rotation|rotation crop]] to discourage the conifer root [[pathogen]] ''[[Phellinus weirii]]'' (Laminated root rot).\n\n''Alnus rubra'' are planted as [[ornamental tree]]s and will do well in wet [[swale]]s, [[riparian]] areas, or on stream banks.\n\nIf used domestically they should be planted well away from drainpipes, [[sewage]] pipes, and water lines, as the roots may invade and clog the lines{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. ''Alnus rubra'' are known for growing easily in burned or destroyed land, and are used as \"pioneering\" or \"reclamation\" trees.\n\n===In woodworking===\nAlder lumber is not considered to be a durable option for outdoor applications,{{Who|date=April 2010}} but due to its workability and ease of finishing it is increasingly used for furniture and cabinetry. Because it is softer than other popular hardwoods such as [[maple]], [[walnut]] and [[fraxinus|ash]], historically alder has not been considered of high value for [[timber]].  However it is now becoming one of the more popular hardwood alternatives as it is more economically priced when compared to other hardwoods. In the world of musical instrument construction, red alder is valued by some electric guitar / electric bass builders for its balanced tonality. Alder is frequently used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for making masks, bowls, tool handles, and other small goods.\n\nThe appearance of alder lumber ranges from white through pinkish to light brown, has a relatively soft hardwood texture, and has medium luster. It is easily worked, glues well, and takes a good finish.\n\n===In fish smoking===\nBecause of its oily smoke, ''A. rubra'' is the wood of choice for smoking salmon.<ref>Ewing, Susan. The Great Alaska Nature Factbook. Portland: Alaska Northwest Books, 1996.</ref>\n\n===As an environmental indicator===\nAdditionally, red alder is often used by scientists as a [[biomonitoring]] organism to locate areas prone to [[ozone]] pollution, as the leaves will react to the presence of high ozone levels by developing red to brown or purple discolourations.<ref name=EONASA>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Library/OzoneWx/|accessdate=2008-10-11|title=Watching Our Ozone Weather|date=2003-08-22|author=Jeannie Allen|publisher=NASA Earth Observatory| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081020145630/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Library/OzoneWx/| archivedate=2008-10-20 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n==Forestry==\nThe vigorous growth has in the past earned it the designation of a \"trash tree\" by the timber industry.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} [[Herbicide]] spraying of red alder over large areas of coastal [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] has resulted in a number of lawsuits, with the claim this spraying has caused health problems, including [[birth defect]]s and other side effects.\n\nIncreasing value of the wood, combined with a better understanding of the species' benefits to other trees, has largely led to a cessation of this practice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n==Genetic Diversity==\n\nFor a population to adapt to changes in the environment, [[genetic diversity]] must exist.<ref name=\"Hughes, A. 2008\">Hughes, A., Inouye, B., Johnson, M., Underwood, N., & Vellend, M.

In the eastern and central regions of its range it is often associated with [[red spruce]] and [[balsam fir]].<ref name=\"fed\" /> It may also be associated with [[Big-Toothed Aspen|big-toothed aspen]], [[yellow birch]], ''[[Betula populifolia]]'', and [[Acer (plant)|maples]]\n\nShrubs often associated with paper birch in the eastern part of its range include: beaked hazel (''[[Corylus cornuta]]''), common bearberry (''[[Arctostaphylos uva-ursi]]''), dwarf bush-honeysuckle (''[[Diervilla lonicera]]''), wintergreen (''[[Gaultheria procumbens]]''), wild sarsaparilla (''[[Aralia nudicaulis]]''), blueberries (''[[Vaccinium]] spp.''), raspberries and blackberries (''[[Rubus]] spp.''), elderberry (''[[Sambucus]] spp.''), and hobblebush (''[[Viburnum alnifolium]]'').\n\n=== Successional relationships ===\n[[File:Boreal forestfire.jpg|thumb|left|A prescribed fire in a black spruce-paper birch-quaking aspen community in boreal Alaska.]]\n\n''Betula papyrifera'' is a [[pioneer species]] meaning it is often one of the first trees to grow in an area after other trees are removed by some sort of disturbance. Typical disturbances colonized by paper birch are [[wildfire]], [[avalanche]], or [[windthrow]] areas where the wind has blown down all trees. When it grows in these pioneer, or early [[secondary succession|successional]], woodlands it often forms stands of trees where it is the only species.<ref name=\"fs\">{{cite web|title=Betula papyrifera|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/betpap/all.html|website=www.fs.fed.us|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nPaper birch is considered well adapted to fires it recovers quickly by means of reseeding the area or regrowth from the burned tree. The lightweight seeds are easily carried by the wind to burned areas where they quickly germinate and grow into new trees. Paper birch is adapted to ecosystems where fires occur every 50\u2013150 years<ref name=\"fs\" /> For example, it is frequently an early invader after fire in [[black spruce]] [[boreal forest]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 |title=Black Spruce (Picea mariana) |first=C.

Since these stands are fire resistant they may become seed trees to reseed the area around them which was burned. However, in dry periods paper birch is flammable and will burn rapidly.<ref name=\"fs\" /> As the bark is flammable it will often burn and may [[Girdling|girdle]] the tree.\n\n=== Wildlife ===\nBirch bark is a winter staple food for [[moose]]. The nutritional quality is poor due to the large quantities of [[lignin]], which make digestion difficult, but is important to wintering moose because of its sheer abundance.<ref name=\"fs\" /> Moose prefer paper birch over [[aspen]], [[alder]], and [[balsam poplar]] but they prefer willow (''[[salix|Salix spp.]]'') over birch and the other species listed. Although moose consume large amounts of paper birch in the winter, if they were to only eat paper birch they may die.<ref name=\"fs\" />\n\nAlthough [[white-tailed deer]] consider birch a \"secondary-choice food\", it is an important dietary component. In Minnesota, white-tailed deer eat considerable amounts of paper birch leaves in the fall. [[Snowshoe hare]]s browse paper birch seedlings.<ref name=\"fs\" /> [[North American porcupine|Porcupines]] feed on the inner bark of the tree and beavers will also feed on the tree. The seeds of paper birch are an important part of the diet of many birds and small mammals including [[chickadee]]s, [[redpoll]]s, [[vole]]s, and [[ruffed grouse]]. [[Yellow bellied sapsucker]]s drill holes in the bark of paper birch to get at the sap, this is one of their favorite trees for feeding on.<ref name=\"fs\" />\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:White birch at Acadia National Park, ME IMG 2177.JPG|200px|thumb|right|White birch at [[Acadia National Park]] in [[Maine]]]]\n\n''Betula papyrifera'' has a soft,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} yet moderately heavy, white wood.

The raw sap contains 0.9% carbohydrates ([[glucose]], [[fructose]], [[sucrose]])<ref name=\"fed\" /> as compared to 2-3% within [[sugar maple]] sap. The sap flows later in the season than maples.  Currently, only a few small scale operations in Alaska and [[Yukon]] currently produce birch syrup from this species.<ref name=\"fed\" />\n\n=== Bark ===\n[[File:Ecorce de bouleau.JPG|thumb|left|Peeling bark]]\nIts bark is an excellent fire starter; it ignites at high temperatures even when wet. The bark has an energy density of 5740 cal/g and 3209 cal/cm{{sup|3}}, the highest per unit weight of 24 species tested.<ref name=\"fed\" />\n\nPanels of bark can be fitted or sewn together to make cartons and boxes (a birchbark box is called a ''[[wiigwaasi-makak]]'' in the Anishinaabe language). The bark is also used to create a durable waterproof layer in the construction of sod-roofed houses.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\" /> Many indigenous groups (i.e. Wabanaki peoples) use birch-bark for making various items such as canoes, containers and wigwams.\n\n=== Plantings ===\nPaper birch is planted to reclaim old mines and other disturbed sites, often bare-root or small saplings are planted when this is the goal.<ref name=\"fs\" /> Since paper birch is an adaptable pioneer species it is a prime candidate for reforesting drastically disturbed areas.\n\nWhen used in landscape planting, it should not be planted near [[black walnut]] as the chemical [[juglone]], exuded from the roots of black walnut, is very toxic to paper birch.\n\nIt is frequently planted as an ornamental due to its graceful form and attractive bark. The bark changes to the white color at about 3 years of growth.<ref name=\"dirr\" /> Paper birch grows best in USDA zones 2-6;<ref name=\"dirr\" /> due to its intolerance of high temperatures, ''[[Betula nigra]]'', or river birch, is recommended for warm-climate areas warmer than zone 6 where paper birch is rarely successful.<ref name=\"ifas\">{{cite web|title=http://hort.ifas.ufl.edu/trees/BETPAPA.pdf|url=http://hort.ifas.ufl.edu/trees/BETPAPA.pdf|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> ''B. papyrifera'' is more resistant to the bronze birch borer than ''[[Betula pendula]]'' which is similarly planted as a landscape tree.\n\n== Pests ==\n[[Birch skeletonizer]] is a small larvea which feeds on the leaves and causes browning.<ref name=\"ifas\" />\n\n[[Birch leafminer]] is a common pest which feeds from inside of the leaf and causes the leaf to turn brown, the first generation appears in May but there will be several generations per year. Severe infestations may stress the tree and make it more vulnerable to the bronze birch borer.<ref name=\"ifas\" />\n\nWhen stressed, [[bronze birch borer]]s may kill a tree. The insect bores into the sapwood, beginning at the top of the tree and causing death of the tree crown.<ref name=\"ifas\" /> The insect has a D shaped emergance hole where it chews out of the tree.  Healthy trees are resistant to the borer but when grown in subideal conditions the defense mechanisms of the tree may not function properly.

The larva of the [[spruce budworm]] eat the buds and growing shoots while the [[spruce needle miner]] hollows out the needles and makes them coalesce in a webbed mass. An elongated white [[scale insect]], the [[Chionaspis pinifoliae|pine needle scale]] feeds on the needles causing fluffy white patches on the twigs and aphids also suck sap from the needles and may cause them to fall and possibly dieback.

The largest known tree, located in [[Umpqua National Forest]], [[Oregon]], is {{convert|69.8|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall with a {{convert|175|cm|in|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} diameter trunk.<ref name=gd>Gymnosperm Database: [http://www.conifers.org/cu/calo/decurrens.htm ''Calocedrus decurrens'']</ref> It has a broad conic crown of spreading branches. The [[bark]] is orange-brown weathering grayish, smooth at first, becoming fissured and exfoliating in long strips on the lower trunk on old trees.\n\nThe foliage is produced in flattened sprays with scale-like [[leaf|leaves]] {{convert|2\u201315|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long; they are arranged in [[opposite (botany)|opposite]] [[decussate]] pairs, with the successive pairs closely then distantly spaced, so forming apparent whorls of four; the facial pairs are flat, with the lateral pairs folded over their bases. The leaves are bright green on both sides of the shoots with only inconspicuous [[stoma]]ta.<ref name=farjon /> The foliage, when crushed, gives off an aroma somewhat akin to shoe-polish.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|seed cones]] are {{convert|20\u201335|mm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} long, pale green to yellow, with four (rarely six) scales arranged in opposite decussate pairs; the outer pair of scales each bears two winged [[seed]]s, the inner pair(s) usually being sterile and fused together in a flat plate. The cones turn orange to yellow-brown when mature about 8 months after pollination. The pollen cones are {{convert|6\u20138|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long.<ref name=farjon />\n\n== Ecology ==\nThis tree is the preferred host of a [[wood wasp]], ''[[Syntexis libocedrii]]'' a [[living fossil]] species which lays its eggs in the smoldering wood immediately after a forest fire.<ref name=usfs /> The tree is also host to incense-cedar mistletoe (''[[Phoradendron libocedri]]''), a [[parasitic plant]] which can often be found hanging from its branches.<ref>[http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_JM_treatment.pl?7836,7852,7856 Jepson Manual Treatment: ''Phoradendron libocedri'' (Incense-cedar mistletoe)]</ref>\n\nThe incense cedar is one of the most fire and drought tolerant plants in California. Although the tree is killed by hot, stand-replacing crown fire, it spreads rapidly after lower intensity burns.<ref>Franklin, Janet; Spears-Lebrun, Linnea A.; Deutschman, Douglas H.; Marsden, Kim. 2006.

[65016]</ref> This has given the incense cedar a competitive advantage over other species such as the [[Pseudotsuga macrocarpa|bigcone Douglas-fir]] in recent years.\n\n== Uses ==\nThe wood is the primary material for wooden [[pencil]]s, because it is soft and tends to sharpen easily without forming splinters.\n\n=== Native Americans ===\nThe [[Indigenous peoples of California|Native Americans of California]] used the plant in traditional medicine{{how|date=July 2016}}, [[basket making]], [[bow and arrow|hunting bows]], building materials, and to produce fire by friction.<ref>[http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Calocedrus+decurrens  University of Michigan\u2014Dearborn: Native American Ethnobotany of ''Calocedrus decurrens'']</ref>\n\nThe [[Maidu]] [[Maidu#Local divisions|Concow tribe]] name for the plant is '''h\u00f6\u2019-t\u00e4''' ([[Konkow language]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chesnut | first1 =Victor King |title=Plants used by the Indians of Mendocino County, California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLkUAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=24 August 2012|year=1902|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office|Government Printing Office]]|page = 404}}</ref>\n\n=== Cultivation ===\n''Calocedrus decurrens'' is cultivated by [[plant nursery|plant nurseries]] as an [[ornamental tree]], for planting in gardens and parks. It is used in traditional, [[xeriscape|xeriscapic]], [[native plant]], and [[wildlife garden]]s; and used in designed [[natural landscaping]] and [[habitat restoration]] projects in [[California]]. It is valued for its columnar form and evergreen foliage textures.\n\nThe tree is also grown in gardens and parks in cool summer climates, including the [[Pacific Northwest]] in the [[Northwestern United States]] and [[British Columbia]], eastern Great Britain and continental [[Northern Europe]]. In these areas it can develop an especially narrow columnar crown, an unexplained consequence of the cooler climatic conditions that is rare in trees within its warm summer natural range in the [[California Floristic Province]].

It is very similar to ''C. macrolepis'', and some botanists treat it as a variety of that, ''C. macrolepis'' var. ''formosana''. It is a medium-sized tree, growing to 25\u201330 m tall, and is rare in the wild, occurring only as scattered trees in mixed forests. The leaves are glaucous green on the upper side of the shoots, and conspicuously marked with bright white stomatal patches on the underside.

This disease is also a problem for horticultural plantings in some parts of North America. The tree is sometimes killed, though less often, by other species of ''[[Phytophthora]]''.\n\n''Phytophthora lateralis'' infection begins when mycelium, from a germinated spore, invade the roots. The infection then spreads through the inner bark and cambium around the base of the tree. Spread up the trunk is generally limited. Infected tissue dies and effectively girdles the tree. Large trees are more likely to be infected than small trees due to larger root areas (although all trees at the edges of infected streams will eventually succumb). However, large trees can often live with the infections for a longer duration (up to several years).\n\n''C. lawsoniana'' in streamside populations are highly susceptible to ''Phytophthora lateralis'' infection. However, the rate of ''Phytophthora'' spread through populations in dry upland areas appears to be slow. ''Phytophthora lateralis'' spreads through water via mobile spores ([[zoospore]]s). The fungus also produces resting spores ([[chlamydospore]]s) that can persist in soil for a long period of time. New infections generally begin when soil is transferred from an infected population to a non-infected population via human or animal movement. After initial infection in streamside populations, secondary spread via zoospores quickly infects all downstream individuals.\n\nHuman facilitated spread is thought to be responsible for most new, and all long-distance, infections. Soil on vehicle tires, especially logging trucks and other off road vehicles, is considered the most pressing problem due to the volume of soil that can be carried and the traffic rate in and between susceptible areas. Spread on boots and mountain bike tires has also been suggested and probably contributes to new infections locally.<ref>{{cite news |title=Roads in the Six Rivers National Forest close to prevent spread of root disease |newspaper=[[Times-Standard]] |location=Eureka, CA |first=Tabitha |last=Soden |date=October 19, 2015 |access-date=8 September 2016 |url=http://www.times-standard.com/article/NJ/20151019/NEWS/151019809 }}</ref> Animal facilitated spread is thought to occur, but is localized.\n\nThe [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) and [[United States Forest Service]] ([[USFS]]) attempt to prevent ''Phytophthora'' spread through road closures, monitoring, research and education.

This species goes by many common names including: '''Nootka cypress''', '''yellow cypress''', '''Alaska cypress''', '''Nootka cedar''', '''yellow cedar''', '''Alaska cedar''', and '''Alaska yellow cedar'''. The specific epithet \"nootkatensis\" is derived from its discovery on the lands of a [[First Nation]] of [[Canada]], those lands of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people]] of [[Vancouver Island]], [[British Columbia]], who were formerly referred to as the Nootka.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nFirst described in the genus ''[[Cupressus]]'' as ''Cupressus nootkatensis'' in 1824, it was transferred to ''[[Chamaecyparis]]'' in 1841 on the basis of its foliage being in flattened sprays, as in other ''Chamaecyparis'', but unlike most (though not all) other ''Cupressus'' species.\n\nHowever, this placement does not fit with the morphology and phenology of the cones, which are far more like ''Cupressus'', like them maturing in two years, not one. Genetic evidence, published by Gadek et al.,<ref>Gadek, P. A., Alpers, D. L., Heslewood, M. M., & Quinn, C. J. 2000. Relationships within Cupressaceae sensu lato: a combined morphological and molecular approach. ''American Journal of Botany'' 87: 1044\u20131057. [http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/abstract/87/7/1044 Abstract]</ref> strongly supported its return to ''Cupressus'' and exclusion from ''Chamaecyparis''.\n\nMore recently, Farjon ''et al.'' (2002) transferred it to a new genus ''Xanthocyparis'', together with the newly discovered [[Xanthocyparis vietnamensis|Vietnamese golden cypress]] ''Xanthocyparis vietnamensis''; this species is remarkably similar to Nootka Cypress and the treatment has many arguments in its favour, as while they are not related to ''Chamaecyparis'', neither do they fit fully in ''Cupressus'' despite the many similarities.\n\nLittle et al.,<ref>Little, D.

The [[Caren Range]] on the west coast of British Columbia is home to the oldest Nootka Cypress specimens in the world, with one specimen found to be 1,834 years old (Gymnosperm Database).<ref name=\"Klinkenberg2014\">{{cite web | url= http://linnet.geog.ubc.ca/Atlas/Atlas.aspx?sciname=Xanthocyparis%20nootkatensis | last= Klinkenberg | first= Brian (Editor) | date= 2014 | title= ''Xanthocyparis nootkatensis'' | website= E-Flora BC: Electronic Atlas of the Plants of British Columbia [eflora.bc.ca]. | publisher= Lab for Advanced Spatial Analysis, Department of Geography, University of British Columbia, Vancouver | accessdate= 2015-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\"WTU Herbarium2015\">{{cite web | url= http://biology.burke.washington.edu/herbarium/imagecollection.php?Genus=Callitropsis&Species=nootkatensis | last= Giblin | first= David (Editor) | date= 2015 | title= ''Callitropsis nootkatensis'' | website= WTU Herbarium Image Collection | publisher= Burke Museum, University of Washington | accessdate= 2015-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\"Jepson\">{{cite web | url= http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_IJM.pl?tid=Callitropsis%20nootkatensis | date= 2015 | title= ''Callitropsis nootkatensis'' | website= Jepson eFlora: Taxon page | publisher= Jepson Herbarium; University of California, Berkeley | accessdate= 2015-03-31}}</ref>\n\n''Cupressus nootkatensis'' is one of the parents of the [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] [[Leyland Cypress]]; as the other parent, [[Cupressus macrocarpa|Monterey Cypress]], is also in genus ''Cupressus'', the ready formation of this hybrid is a further argument for the placement of the Nootka Cypress close to ''Cupressus''.\n\n===Climate-related Mortality===\nIn Alaska, where the tree is primarily referred to as \"yellow cedar,\" extensive research has been conducted into large-scale die-offs of yellow cedar stands. These studies have concluded that the tree has depended upon heavy coastal snowpacks to insulate its shallow roots from cold Arctic winters. The impacts of [[climate change]] have resulted in thinner, less-persistent snowpacks, in turn causing increased susceptibility to freeze damage.<ref name=PNWRS>[http://www.fs.fed.us/pnw/news/2012/02/yellow-cedar.shtml Yellow-cedar are dying in Alaska; scientists now know why]</ref>  This mortality has been observed over 7% of the species range, covering approximately 10 degrees of latitude from northern southeast Alaska to southern British Columbia.

The wood has been used for flooring, interior finish and shipbuilding<ref>Peattie, Donald Culross.  Trees You Want to Know.  Whitman Publishing Company, Racine, Wisconsin, 1934 page 30</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe various physical properties of the [[wood]] make it an attractive material for both general construction and boat building. Due to its slow growth it is hard and, like other cypress woods it is durable; it therefore offers good dimensional stability, and is resistant to weather, insects, and contact with soil. It works easily with hand or machine tools; it turns and carves quite well. It can be fastened with glues, screws, and nails. Nootka Cypress's texture, uniform color, and straight grain will take a fine finish. It resists splintering and wears smoothly over time. When fresh cut it has a somewhat unpleasant bitter scent, but when seasoned it has barely any discernible scent, hence its traditional use in face masks.\n\nDue to its expense, it is used mainly for finished carpentry. Typical uses include exterior siding, shingles, decking, exposed beams, glue-laminated beams, paneling, cabinetry, and [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]]. In [[historic preservation]] it can be used as a substitute for ''[[Thuja plicata]]'' (Western Red Cedar) and ''[[Taxodium distichum]]'' (Baldcypress), due to current difficulties in obtaining quality timber of those species due to environmental concern and past over-exploitation, although this applies equally to Nootka Cypress.\n\nOther uses for Nootka Cypress include saunas, and battery containers due to its resistance to acids. Traditionally, paddles, masks, dishes, and bows were made from the wood.\n\n=== Landscaping ===\n[[Image:Chamaecyparis Nootkatensis.jpg|thumb|right|Cultivated Specimens at [[Morton Arboretum]]]]\n\nThe drooping branchlets give the tree a graceful weeping appearance. It makes an attractive specimen tree in [[park]]s and open spaces. It can also be used as a tall [[Hedge (gardening)|hedge]].\n\nIt will grow in [[USDA plant hardiness zone]]s 5-9, but can be difficult to grow. Best growth is in light or heavy soil, preferably well drained, and in climates with cool summers. It prefers semi-shade to full sun.\n\nNootka Cypress can also be used in [[bonsai]].\n\nThe [[cultivar]] ''C. nootkatensis'' 'Pendula' has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Cupressus nootkatensis'' 'Pendula'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=404|accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Firewood ===\nNootka Cypress has extreme heartwood qualities that make this one of the most desired sources of heat on the west coast. A dead tree can last up to 100 years for firewood. This wood burns very hot and lasts a long time as embers.\n\n== Indigenous societies ==\n\nSee main article for [[Indigenous Uses of Yellow Cedar]].\n\nThe Nootka Cypress is used extensively by the [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]], along with another cypress, ''[[Thuja plicata]]'' (Western Red Cedar).  While Western Red Cedar was preferred for larger projects (houses, canoes), Nootka Cypress was used for smaller carvings such as vessels and utensils.\n\nA legend amongst the Nootka peoples of the [[Hesquiaht First Nation]] tells of the origins of the Nootka Cypress.  In the legend, a [[raven]] encounters three young women drying salmon on the beach.  He asks the women if they are afraid of being alone, if they are afraid of bears, wolves, and other animals.  Each women responded \"no\".  But when asked about [[owl]]s, the women were indeed afraid of owls.  Hearing this, the trickster raven hid in the forests, and made the calls of an owl.  The terrified women ran up the mountains, but turned into Nootka Cypress trees when they were out of breath.  According to the Nootka, this is why Nootka Cypress grows on the sides of mountains, and also why the bark is silky like a woman's hair, the young trunk is smooth like a woman's body.<ref>Stewart, Hilary.

''glauca'']])}}\n}}\n\n'''''Pseudotsuga menziesii''''', commonly known as '''Douglas fir''' or '''Douglas-fir''', is an [[evergreen]] [[conifer]] [[species]] [[native plant|native]] to western [[North America]]. One variety, the coast Douglas fir, grows along the Pacific Ocean from central [[British Columbia]] south to central [[California]]. A second variety, the Rocky Mountain Douglas fir, grows in the [[Rocky Mountains]] from British Columbia south to [[Mexico]]. The tree is dominant in western [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. It is extensively used for timber, worldwide.\n\n== Naming ==\nThe common name honors [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]], a Scottish botanist and collector who first reported the extraordinary nature and potential of the species. The common name is misleading since it is not a true fir, i.e., not a member of the genus ''[[Abies]]''. For this reason the name is often written as '''Douglas-fir''' (a name also used for the genus ''[[Pseudotsuga]]'' as a whole).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oregonstate.edu/trees/conifer_genera/douglas_fir.html |title=Douglas-fir (''Pseudotsuga'') |work=Common Trees of the Pacific Northwest |publisher=Oregon State University |accessdate=March 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe specific epithet, ''menziesii'', is after [[Archibald Menzies]], a Scottish physician and rival [[Natural history|naturalist]] to [[David Douglas (botanist)|David Douglas]]. Menzies first documented the tree on [[Vancouver Island]] in 1791. Colloquially, the species is also known simply as '''Doug-fir''' or as '''Douglas pine''' (although the latter common name may also refer to ''[[Pinus douglasiana]]'').\n\nOne [[Coast Salish]] name for the tree, used in the [[Halkomelem]] language, is ''l\u00e1:yelhp''.<ref>Dictionary of Upriver Halkomelem, Volume I, pp. 213. Galloway, Brent Douglas.</ref>\n\n==Description==\nDouglas firs are medium-size to extremely large [[evergreen]] [[tree]]s, {{convert|20|-|100|m|-1}} tall (although only coast Douglas firs reach such great height).<ref>{{cite book|title=Forest Giants of the World Past and Present|first=Al|last=Carder|year=1995|pages=3\u20134}}</ref> The [[leaf|leaves]] are flat, soft, linear, {{convert|2|-|4|cm|in|1}} long, generally resembling those of the firs, occurring singly rather than in [[fascicle (botany)|fascicle]]s; they completely encircle the branches, which can be useful in recognizing the species. As the trees grow taller in denser forest, they lose their lower branches, such that the foliage may start high off the ground. Douglas firs in environments with more light may have branches much closer to the ground.\n\nThe female [[Conifer cone|cones]] are pendulous, with persistent scales unlike true firs. They are distinctive in having a long tridentine (three-pointed) [[bract]] that protrudes prominently above each scale (it resembles the back half of a mouse, with two feet and a tail).\n\n== Distribution ==\nOne [[Variety (botany)|variety]], [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|coast Douglas fir]] (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var. ''menziesii''), grows in the coastal regions, from west-central [[British Columbia]] southward to central [[California]]. In [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], its range is continuous from the eastern edge of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] west to the [[Pacific Coast Ranges]] and Pacific Ocean. In California, it is found in the [[Klamath Mountains|Klamath]] and [[California Coast Ranges]] as far south as the [[Santa Lucia Range]], with a small stand as far south as the [[Purisima Hills]] in Santa Barbara County.<ref>{{cite journal |title=A New Douglas-Fir Locality in Southern California |author=James R.

It occurs from near sea level along the coast to {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level in the mountains of California.\n\nFurther inland, coast Douglas fir is replaced by another variety, [[Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca|Rocky Mountain or interior Douglas fir]] (''P.&nbsp;menziesii'' var. ''glauca''). Interior Douglas fir intergrades with coast Douglas fir in the Cascades of northern Washington and southern British Columbia, and from there ranges northward to central British Columbia and southeastward to the Mexican border, becoming increasingly disjunct as latitude decreases and altitude increases.  [[Pseudotsuga lindleyana|Mexican Douglas fir]] (''P.&nbsp;lindleyana''), which ranges as far south as [[Oaxaca]], is often considered a variety of ''P. menziesii''.\n\n== Ecology ==\nDouglas-fir prefers acidic or neutral soils.<ref>https://www.arborday.org/trees/treeguide/treedetail.cfm?itemID=836</ref>  However, Douglas fir exhibits considerable morphological plasticity, and on drier sites coast Douglas fir will generate deeper taproots.  Interior Douglas fir exhibits even greater plasticity, occurring in stands of interior temperate rainforest in British Columbia, as well as at the edge of semi-arid sagebrush steppe throughout much of its range, where it generates even deeper taproots than coast Douglas fir is capable.\n[[File:Pseudotsuga menziesii 01221.JPG|left|thumb|upright|A [[snag (ecology)|snag]] provides nest cavities for birds]]\n\nMature or \"old-growth\" Douglas fir forest is the primary habitat of the [[red tree vole]] (''Arborimus longicaudus'') and the [[spotted owl]] (''Strix occidentalis''). Home range requirements for breeding pairs of spotted owls are at least 400&nbsp;ha ({{convert|4|km2|acre|disp=comma}}) of old-growth. Red tree voles may also be found in immature forests if Douglas fir is a significant component. This animal nests almost exclusively in the foliage of Douglas fir trees. Nests are located {{convert|2|-|50|m|ft|round=5}} above the ground. The red vole's diet consists chiefly of Douglas fir needles. A [[parasitic plant]] sometimes utilizing ''P. menziesii'' is [[Douglas-fir dwarf mistletoe]] (''Arceuthobium douglasii'').\n\nThe leaves are also used by the [[Adelgidae|woolly conifer aphid]] ''[[Adelges cooleyi]]''; this 0.5&nbsp;mm long [[Sap (plant)|sap]]-sucking [[insect]] is conspicuous on the undersides of the leaves by the small white \"fluff spots\" of protective wax that it produces. It is often present in large numbers, and can cause the foliage to turn yellowish from the damage in causes. Exceptionally, trees may be partially defoliated by it, but the damage is rarely this severe. Among [[Lepidoptera]], apart from some that feed on ''[[Pseudotsuga]]'' in general (see there) the [[gelechiid moth]]s ''Chionodes abella'' and ''C. periculella'' as well as the cone scale-eating [[tortrix moth]] ''[[Cydia illutana]]'' have been recorded specifically on ''P. menziesii''.\n\n[[File:Pseudotsuga menziesii 7971.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Mature individual in the [[Wenatchee Mountains]]]]\n\nThe coast Douglas fir variety is the dominant tree west of the Cascade Mountains in the [[Pacific Northwest]], occurring in nearly all forest types, competes well on most parent materials, aspects, and slopes. Adapted to a moist, mild climate, it grows larger and faster than [[Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir|Rocky Mountain Douglas fir]]. Associated trees include [[western hemlock]], [[Sitka spruce]], [[sugar pine]], [[western white pine]], [[ponderosa pine]], [[grand fir]], [[coast redwood]], [[western redcedar]], [[incense-cedar|California incense-cedar]], [[Chamaecyparis lawsoniana|Lawson's cypress]], [[tanoak]], [[bigleaf maple]] and several others. Pure stands are also common, particularly north of the [[Umpqua River]] in Oregon.\n\n[[Poriol]] is a flavanone, a type of flavonoid, produced by ''P. menziesii'' in reaction to infection by ''[[Poria weirii]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Barton | first1 = G.M. | year = 1972 | title = New C-methylflavanones from Douglas fir | url = | journal = Phytochemistry | volume = 11 | issue = 1| pages = 426\u2013429 | doi = 10.1016/S0031-9422(00)90036-0 }}</ref>\n\n== Forest succession ==\nThe shade-intolerance of Douglas fir plays a large role in the forest [[Ecological succession|succession]] of lowland old growth rainforest communities of the Pacific Northwest. While mature stands of lowland old-growth rainforest contain many [[western hemlock]] (''Tsuga heterophylla'') seedlings, and some [[western redcedar]] (''Thuja plicata'') seedlings, Douglas fir dominated stands contain almost no Douglas fir seedlings. This seeming contradiction occurs because Douglas firs are intolerant of deep shade and rarely survive for long within the shaded understory.  When a tree dies in a mature [[forest]] the canopy opens up and sunlight becomes available as a source of energy for new growth. The shade-tolerant western hemlock seedlings that sprout beneath the canopy have a head-start on other seedlings. This competitive advantage allows the western hemlock to grow rapidly into the sunlight, while other [[seedling]]s still struggle to emerge from the soil. The boughs of the growing western hemlock limit the sunlight for smaller trees and severely limit the chances of shade-intolerant trees, such as the Douglas fir. Over the course of centuries, western hemlock typically come to dominate the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] of an old-growth lowland rainforest.\n\nDouglas firs are [[seral]] trees in [[temperate rainforest]], and possess thicker bark and a somewhat faster growth rate than most other climax trees of the area, such as the western hemlock and western redcedar. This quality often gives Douglas firs a competitive advantage when the forest experiences a major disturbance such as fire. Periodically, portions of a Pacific Northwest lowland forest may be burned by wildfire, may be logged, or may be blown down by a wind storm. These types of disturbances allow Douglas fir to regenerate in openings, and low-intensity fires often leave Douglas fir trees standing on drier sites, while less drought- and fire-tolerant species are unable to get established.\n\n[[File:Red Creek Fir.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Red Creek fir]], about {{convert|15|km|mi}} from [[Port Renfrew]], in [[British Columbia]], measures {{convert|43.7|ft|m}} around its base and stretches {{convert|242|ft|m}} high]]\n\nConifers dominate the climax forests of the coast Douglas fir. All of the climax conifers that grow alongside it can live for centuries, with a few species capable of living for over a millennium. Forests that exist on this time scale experience the type of sporadic disturbances that allow mature stands of Douglas fir to establish themselves as a persistent element within a mature old-growth forest. When [[old growth forests]] survive in a natural state, they often look like a patchwork quilt of different forest communities. Western hemlock typically dominate oldgrowth rainforests, but contain sections of Douglas firs, redcedar, [[alder]], and even [[coast redwood]] forests on their southern extent, near the Oregon and California border, while [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]] increases in frequency with latitude.\n\nThe logging practices of the last 200 years created artificial disturbances that caused Douglas firs to thrive. The Douglas fir's useful wood and its quick growth make it the crop of choice for many timber companies, which typically replant a clear-cut area with Douglas fir seedlings. The high-light conditions that exist within a clear-cut also naturally favor the regeneration of Douglas fir. Because of clear-cut logging, almost all the Pacific Northwest forests not strictly set aside for protection are today dominated by Douglas fir, while the normally dominant climax species, such as western hemlock and western redcedar are less common. On drier sites in California, where Douglas fir behaves as a climax species in the absence of fire, the Douglas fir has become somewhat invasive following fire suppression practices of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries; it is becoming a dominant species in many [[oak]] [[California oak woodland|woodlands]], in which it was previously a minor component.<ref>C.

It is native to the [[southwestern United States]] and northern [[Mexico]], where it grows in a number of habitats including [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|desert scrub]] and [[chaparral]]. It is unusual in the genus in that some (though not all) specimens have simple leaves instead of the pinnate leaves more characteristic of the group.\n\n==Description==\n''Fraxinus anomala'' is a deciduous [[shrub]] or small tree approaching maximum heights of five to six meters. The leaf may be simple or it may be compound, composed of up to five leaflets which look like individual leaves. Each leaflet is oval-shaped to round and may have teeth along the edges. The nondescript brownish flowers lack petals. The fruit is a flat [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] up to two centimeters long and one wide, green when young and tan to brown when mature. The samaras hang in bunches.\n\n==Distribution==\nIn [[Arizona]], singleleaf ash is found along the [[Arizona transition zone]] of the [[Mogollon Rim]]. In northern Arizona's [[Grand Canyon]], the range extends down the main canyons from southern and southeastern [[Utah]], its major range area, where the [[Canyon Lands]] also show the range entering upper reaches of river basins flowing from western [[Colorado]] &ndash; [[Colorado River|Colorado]] and [[Dolores River]]s; also the shorter [[Yellowjacket River|Yellowjacket]] and [[McElmo River]]s in Colorado's extreme southwest.<ref>Little.

Scientifically for red ash this is because modern cultivars utilized regionally were parented from sometimes only four individual trees selected for unique traits and male seedless flowering. Proclaiming a harsh lesson learned, cities like Chicago did not replace dead elms with a 1:1 ash:elm ratio. Instead, Norway, silver, red and sugar maples, honey locust, linden/basswood, redbud, crabapples and hackberry, among others, were also utilized during this recovery period and in new urban and suburban areas. Fortunately, with these additional species, many cities were able to reduce the percent of ash and other species to much lower levels (20% average) than during the Dutch elm disease era where from 56% to 100% of the trees were elm.\n\nBoth American elm and green ash were extremely popular due to rapid growth and tolerance of urban pollution and road salt, so many housing developments in [[Michigan]] were lined from end to end with ashes, a result of which the beetles had an enormous food supply to boost their population well above Infestation thresholds. The tree was also extensively propagated and sold by local nurseries. According to the American Nursery Industry, \"Back in the late 1980s, Dr. Frank Santamour Jr., then a research geneticist with the U.S. National Arboretum, proposed the 10-20-30 formula for diversity in the urban forest, limiting the plantings in a community to no more than 10 percent within a single species, 20 percent within a genus and 30 percent within a family.\"\"\u00a0Because of EAB today, many communities  are using a more strict 20 -10-5 rule.\n\nThe emerald ash borer proved to be a far worse and potentially more serious threat than epidemics of the past such as chestnut blight and Dutch elm disease because those diseases spread at a slower rate, only affected one species, and did not kill the trees before they could attain reproductive maturity. Many areas have banned the sale of ash seedlings in nurseries, although seeds may be sold as they are not a vector for the insect.\n\n== Uses ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== Urban ornamental trees ===\n[[File:2014-10-29 13 12 58 Green Ash foliage during autumn coloration in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|thumb|right|Autumn leaf color]]\nGreen ash is one of the most widely planted [[ornamental plant|ornamental trees]] throughout the [[United States]] and much of [[Canada]] but mostly [[Alberta]], including in western areas where it is not native. It is also widely planted in [[Argentina]]. It is very popular due to its good form and resistance to disease.

Today used as living national monuments, the National Park Service is protecting [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s 200-year-old planted example, and [[George Washington]]'s 250-year-old [[white ash]] which has a 600-year possible lifespan.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Green ash had been widely used as a primary ornamental and long lived monument tree until the elm fad of the 1880s, and regained top position once again after [[Dutch elm disease]] arrived.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nOther continents learned of American ash species' urban survivability and unique beauty through the worldwide popularity of Midwestern Prairie style ecology and architectural movement. Modernizing cities in [[Russia]] and [[China]] then began using imported green ash a century ago to line streets and landscape new public parks.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} When one Chinese city's original collection, which had survived into late 1980's suddenly all died, city fathers used trees by sending them back to America as wooden crates containing Chinese made parts supplying the American auto industry.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Advantages of green ash include its tolerance of harsh urban environmental conditions, ease of propagation, and (in eastern North America) its value for wildlife as a native [[keystone species]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ash Tree Identification|url=http://www.nyis.info/?action=eab_ash_tree_identification|website=New York Invasive Species Information|publisher=Cornell University Cooperative Extension|accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\nGreen ash [[wood]] is similar in properties to [[Fraxinus americana|white ash]] wood, and is marketed together as \"white ash\". The commercial supply is mostly in the South. It is very popular, used in making [[electric guitar]]s because it can be somewhat lighter than white ash without sacrificing too much in tone. It has a bright sound with long sustain, plus the wood grain is aesthetically desirable to many guitar players. [[Gibson]], [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], [[Ibanez]], [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]], M2Guitars and many other [[luthier]]s use ash in the construction of their guitars.\n\n== References ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{Commons category|Fraxinus pennsylvanica}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Fraxinus|pennsylvanica]]\n[[Category:Trees of humid continental climate]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]\n[[Category:Trees of Western Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1785]]",

It is a high-altitude species; in the north of its range, it grows widely at {{convert|1500|to|2100|m|abbr=on}} altitude, and at {{convert|1800|to|2900|m|abbr=on}} in the south of its range.<ref name=\"silvics\">{{Silvics |first=James L. |last=Jenkinson |volume=1 |genus=Pinus |species=jeffreyi}}</ref>\n\nJeffrey pine is tolerant of [[serpentine soil]]s and is often dominant in these conditions, even on dry sites at fairly low altitudes.<ref name=\"silvics\"/> On other soils, it only becomes dominant at higher altitudes where the usually faster-growing ponderosa pine (''[[Pinus ponderosa]]'') does not thrive. Jeffrey pine is more stress tolerant than the closely related [[Ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus ponderosa''). At higher elevations, on poorer soils, in colder climates, and in dryer climates, Jeffrey pine replaces ponderosa as the dominant tree.<ref name=NRVYP/>\n\n[[File:Jeffrey pine Siskiyou Wilderness.jpg|thumb|left|x160px|Jeffrey pine, ''Pinus jeffreyi'', in the [[Siskiyou Mountains]] of northwest California, growing on [[serpentine group|serpentine]]]]\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Description==\nJeffrey pine is a large [[pinophyta|coniferous]] [[evergreen]] tree, reaching {{convert|25|to|40|m|abbr=on}} tall, rarely up to {{convert|53|m|abbr=on}} tall, though smaller when growing at or near [[tree line]].<ref name=\"silvics\"/> The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, in bundles of three, stout, [[glaucous]] gray-green, {{convert|12|to|23|cm|abbr=on}} long. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are {{convert|12|to|24|cm|abbr=on}} long, dark purple when immature, ripening pale brown, with thinly woody scales bearing a short, sharp inward-pointing barb. The seeds are {{convert|10|to|12|mm|abbr=on}} long, with a large ({{convert|15|to|25|mm|abbr=on}}) wing.\n\nThe Jeffrey pine is closely related to the ponderosa pine and is similar in appearance. One way to distinguish between them is by their cones. Each has barbs at the end of the scales. The sharp Jeffrey pine cone scale barbs point inward, so the cone feels smooth to the palm of one's hand when rubbed down the cone. Ponderosa pine cone scale barbs point outward, so feel sharp and prickly to the palm of one's hands. This gives rise to the memory device for distinguishing between them - \"gentle Jeffrey and prickly ponderosa\". Another distinguishing characteristic is that the needles of Jeffrey pine are glaucous, less bright green than those of ponderosa pine, and by the stouter, heavier cones with larger seeds and inward-pointing barbs.<ref name=\"Moore2008\">{{cite book |last1=Moore|first1=Gerry |last2=Kershner|first2=Bruce |first3=Craig|last3=Tufts |first4=Daniel|last4=Mathews |first5=Gil|last5=Nelson |last6=Spellenberg|first6=Richard |last7=Thieret|first7=John W. |first8=Terry|last8=Purinton |last9=Block|first9=Andrew|display-authors=4 |title=National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Trees of North America |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |year=2008 |page=86 |isbn=1-4027-3875-7}}</ref> Jeffrey pine is also very distinct from ponderosa pine in its [[resin]] scent, variously described as reminiscent of vanilla, lemon, pineapple, violets, apple,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enature.com/flashcard/show_flash_card.asp?recordNumber=TS0040|title=Jeffrey Pine|work=enature.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614142314/http://www.enature.com/flashcard/show_flash_card.asp?recordNumber=TS0040|archivedate=2011-06-14}}</ref> and, quite commonly, butterscotch;<ref>{{cite book|title=Wild Plants of the Sierra Nevada|first1=Ray S.|last1=Vizgirdas|first2=Edna M.|last2=Rey-Vizgirdas|year=2006|publisher=University of Nevada Press|location=Reno, Nevada}}</ref> compared to the turpentine or odorless scent of ponderosa pine {{citation needed|reason=Ponderosa pines are also found to have similar smells to Jeffrey Pines (http://www.npr.org/2009/08/17/111803772/ponderosa-pines-rugged-trees-with-a-sweet-smell)|date=October 2014}}. This may be tested by breaking off a shoot or some needles, or by simply smelling the resin's scent in between the plates of the bark. This difference in scent is related to the very unusual composition of the resin, with the [[volatile organic compound|volatile]] component made up almost entirely of pure [[heptane|n-heptane]]. Jeffrey pine can be somewhat distinguished from ponderosa pine by the relatively smaller scales of bark as compared to the larger plates of more reddish-colored ponderosa bark.\n\n==Uses==\nJeffrey pine wood is similar to ponderosa pine wood, and is used for the same purposes. The exceptional purity of n-heptane distilled from Jeffrey pine resin led to n-heptane being selected as the zero point on the [[Petrol#Octane rating|octane rating]] scale of [[petrol]].\n\nAs it mainly consists of n-heptane, Jeffrey pine resin is a poor source of [[turpentine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plants.usda.gov/plantguide/pdf/pg_pije.pdf|title=Jeffrey Pine|work=NRCS Plant Guide|publisher=USDA}}</ref>  Before Jeffrey pine was distinguished from ponderosa pine as a distinct species in 1853, resin distillers operating in its range suffered a number of 'inexplicable' explosions during distillation, now known to have been caused by the unwitting use of Jeffrey pine resin.\n\n==Cultivation==\nJeffrey pine has ornamental value and can be found in parks and gardens throughout the [[Temperate climate|temperate]] world.

The shoots are dimorphic, with growth divided into long shoots (typically {{convert|10|to|50|cm|in}} long) and bearing several [[bud]]s, and short shoots only {{convert|1|to|2|mm|in}} long with only a single bud. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, light green, {{convert|2|to|5|cm|in}} long, and very slender; they turn bright yellow in the fall, leaving the pale orange-brown shoots bare until the next spring.\n\nThe seed [[conifer cone|cones]] are ovoid-cylindric, {{convert|2|to|5|cm|in}} long, with 40 to 80 seed scales; each scale bearing an [[wikt:exserted|exserted]] {{convert|4|to|8|mm|in}} [[bract]].

It can reach {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall (though {{convert|15|-|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} is more usual) in the [[California Coast Ranges]], and can have a trunk diameter of {{convert|60|-|190|cm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\nTanbark-oak was recently moved into a new genus, '''''Notholithocarpus''''' (from ''Lithocarpus''), based on multiple lines of evidence.<ref name=manos01>{{cite journal| title=Phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic status of the paleoendemic Fagaceae of Western North America: recognition of a new genus, ''Notholithocarpus''| url=http://www.ecologicalevolution.org/content/pdf/Manos09_Notholithocarpus.pdf| format=PDF| journal=Madrono| volume=55| number=3| pages=181\u2013190| year=2008| first=Paul S.| last=Manos| first2=Charles H.| last2=Cannon| first3=Sang-Hun| last3=Oh| doi=10.3120/0024-9637-55.3.181}}</ref> It is most closely related to the north temperate oaks, ''[[Quercus]]'', and not as closely related to the Asian tropical stone oaks, ''[[Lithocarpus]]'' (where it was previously placed), but instead is an example of convergent morphological evolution.\n\n[[Image:Notholithocarpus densiflorus range map.jpg|thumb|right|Natural range]]\n\n==Description==\nThe ''Notholithocarpus (prev. Lithocarpus) densiflorus'' [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, {{convert|7|-|15|cm|in|abbr=on}}, with toothed margins and a hard, leathery texture, and persist for three to four years. At first they are covered in dense orange-brown scurfy hairs on both sides, but those on the upper surface soon wear off, those on the under surface persisting longer but eventually wearing off too.\n\nThe [[seed]] is a [[acorn]] {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and 2&nbsp;cm in diameter, very similar to an [[oak]] [[acorn]], but with a very hard, woody nut shell more like a [[hazel]] nut. The nut sits in a cup during its 18-month maturation; the outside surface of the cup is rough with short spines. The nuts are produced in clusters of a few together on a single stem. The nut kernel is very bitter, and is inedible for people without extensive leaching, although [[squirrel]]s eat them.\n\nTanoak is one of the species most seriously affected by \"sudden oak death\" (''[[Phytophthora ramorum]]''), with high mortality reported over much of the species' range.<ref>http://cisr.ucr.edu/sudden_oak_death.html Sudden Oak Death at University of California, Riverside, Center for Invasive Species Research</ref>\n\n===''Notholithocarpus densiflorus'' var. ''echinoides''===\nMembers of populations in interior California (in the northern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]) and the [[Klamath Mountains]] into southwest Oregon are smaller, rarely exceeding {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height and often shrubby, with smaller leaves, {{convert|4|-|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; these are separated as \"dwarf tanoak\", ''Notholithocarpus densiflorus'' var. ''echinoides''. The variety intergrades with the type in northwest California and southwest Oregon. Tanoak does grow on [[serpentine soil]]s as a shrub.\n\n==Uses==\n\nSome California [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] prefer this nut to those of many ''[[Quercus]]'' [[acorn]]s because it stores well due to the comparatively high tannin content. The [[Maidu#Local divisions|Concow tribe]] call the nut '''h\u00e4\u2019-h\u00e4''' ([[Konkow language]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chesnut | first1 =Victor King |title=Plants used by the Indians of Mendocino County, California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLkUAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=24 August 2012|year=1902|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office|Government Printing Office]]|page = 405}}</ref> The [[Hupa]] people use the acorns to make meal, from which they would make mush, bread, biscuits, pancakes, and cakes.

By 1907 the use of tanoak for tannin was subsiding due to the scarcity of large tanoak trees. There weren't enough trees around for a worthwhile economic return.

Increased rates of [[transpiration]] in response to loss of snowpack, coupled with low sapwood water reserves and an extended period of soil frost in windswept areas, may prevent Engelmann spruce from regenerating in open areas both above and below the tree line. Cuticular damage by windblown ice is probably more important at the tree line,<ref name=\"hadley1\">Hadley, J.L.; Smith, W.K. 1983.

''engelmannii'' ('''Engelmann spruce'''). All of the range except as below.\n*''Picea engelmannii'' subsp. ''mexicana'' ('''Mexican spruce'''). Two isolated populations on high mountains in northern [[Mexico]], on the Sierra del Carmen in [[Coahuila]] ([[Sierra Madre Oriental]]) and on Cerro Mohinora in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] ([[Sierra Madre Occidental]]). Engelmann spruces of the [[Madrean sky islands]] mountains in the extreme southeast of Arizona and southwest of New Mexico also probably belong to this subspecies, though this is disputed.\n\nThe Engelmann spruce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridises]] and intergrades extensively with the closely related [[white spruce]] (''Picea glauca''), found further north and east in the Rocky Mountains, and to a lesser extent with the closely related [[Sitka spruce]] where they meet on the western fringes of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]].\n\n== Uses ==\nEngelmann spruce is of economic importance for its [[wood]], harvested for [[paper]]-making and general construction. Wood from slow-grown trees at high altitude has a specialised use in making musical instruments such as acoustic [[guitar]]s, [[harp]]s, [[violin]]s, and [[piano]]s. It is also used to a small extent as a [[Christmas tree]].\n\n==Predators==\nOutbreaks of [[Dendroctonus rufipennis|spruce beetles]] have destroyed millions of Engelmann spruce trees.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Picea engelmannii.jpg|Tree\nImage:Picea engelmannii Sierra Blanca NM.jpg|Young tree\nImage:Picea_engelmannii_16786.JPG|Section ([[William O.

Its northern distribution roughly correlates to the location of the [[tree line]], which includes an [[isotherm (contour line)|isothermic]] value of {{Convert|10|C|F}} for mean [[temperature]] in July, as well as the position of the [[Arctic front]]; cumulative summer degree days, mean net radiation, and the amount of light intensities also figure. White spruce generally is found in regions where the [[growing season]] exceeds 60 days annually.<ref name=\"SilvicsNA\" />\n\nThe southern edge of the zone in which white spruce forms 60% or more of the total stand corresponds more or less to the July isotherm of {{Convert|18|C|F}} around the [[Great Lakes]]; in the [[Prairie Provinces]] its limit is north of this isotherm. During the [[summer solstice]], [[day length]] values range from 17 hours at its southern limits to 24 hours above the [[Arctic Circle]].<ref name=\"SilvicsNA\" />\n\nOne of the hardiest [[conifers]], white spruce in parts of its range withstands mean daily January temperature of {{convert|-6.7|C|F}} and extreme minimum temperatures as low as {{convert|-56.5|C|F}}; minimum temperatures of {{convert|-50|C|F}} are general throughout much of the range except the southernmost and southeasternmost parts (Fowells 1965).<ref name=\"fowells\">Fowells, H.A. 1965.

In Labrador, white spruce is not abundant and constitutes less than 5% of the forest, with a range that coincides very closely with that of black spruce but extending slightly further north (Wilton 1964).<ref name=\"wilton\">Wilton, R.F. 1964.

Bryson et al.

Collins and Sumner (1953)<ref name=\"collins\" /> reported finding white spruce within 13&nbsp;km of the Arctic coast in the Firth valley, Yukon, at about 69\u00b030\u2032 N, 139\u00b030\u2032 W, and Sargent (1922)<ref name=\"sargent2\" /> noted that white spruce in Alaska \u201creached Behring Strait in 66\u00b044\u2032 N\u201d.\n\n[[Climate]], especially temperature, is obviously a factor in determining distributions of northern [[flora]]. Halliday and Brown (1943)<ref name=\"hall2\" /> suggested that white spruce\u2019s northern limit corresponds \u201cvery closely\u201d with the July mean monthly isotherm of 10&nbsp;\u00b0C in Ungava, but that the northern limit west of Hudson Bay was south of that isotherm. Other climatic factors that have been suggested as affecting the northern limit of white spruce include: cumulative summer degree days, position of the Arctic front in July, mean net radiation especially during the growing season, and low light intensities (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990).<ref name=\"SilvicsNA\" /> Topography, soil conditions, and glaciation may also be important in controlling northern limits of spruce (Drew and Shanks 1965).<ref name=\"drew\">Drew, J.V.; Shanks, R.E. 1965.

From east of the main range of coastal mountains in British Columbia, the southern continuous limit of white spruce is the forest/prairie interface through Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, the northern parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, central Michigan, northeastern New York, and Maine (Fowells 1965).<ref name=\"fowells\" /> Sargent (1922)<ref name=\"sargent2\" /> and Harlow and Harrar (1950)<ref name=\"harlow\" /> also included Vermont and New Hampshire; and, while Dame and Brooks (1901)<ref name=\"dame\">Dame, L.L.; Brooks, H. 1901.

Ginn, Boston MA. 196 p.</ref> excluded New York and states further west, they included Massachusetts as far south as Amherst and Northampton, \u201cprobably the southern limit of the species\u201d in that area. Nisbet (1905)<ref name=\"nisbet\">Nisbet, J. 1905. The Forester. Blackwood and Sons, Edinburgh and London, U.K., Vol. 1. 506 p.</ref> gave the range of white spruce as extending to \u201cCarolina\u201d, but he did not recognize red spruce as a species and presumably included it with white spruce.\n\nTowards the southern parts of its range, white spruce encounters increasingly effective [[Ecology|ecological]] competition from [[hardwood]]s, some of which may reinforce their growth-rate/sprouting competitiveness with allelopathic depredation of [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] regeneration (Tubbs 1976).<ref name=\"tubbs\">Tubbs, C.H. 1976.

In a narrow belt of mixed Norway and white spruces over an extremely exposed hilltop crest at high elevation in northern England, the Norway spruce were \u201ccompletely dwarfed\u201d whereas the white spruce had reached heights of between 3 and 4.3 m (Guillebaud et al. 1920).<ref name=\"guill\">Guillebaud, W.H.; Steven, H.M.; Marsden, R.E. 1920.

Throughout the greater part of its range, white spruce routinely survives and is undamaged by winter temperatures of {{convert|\u221250|C|F}}, and even lower temperatures occur in parts of the range (Fowells 1965, Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990).<ref name=\"SilvicsNA\" /><ref name=\"fowells\"/> [[Taiga|Boreal]] ''Picea'' are among the few extremely hardy [[Pinophyta|conifers]] in which the bud primordia are able to survive temperatures down to {{convert|-70|C|F|disp=comma}} (Sakai and Larcher 1987).<ref name=\"sakai4\">Sakai, A.; Larcher, W. (Eds.) 1987. Frost Survival of Plants. Springer-Verlag, New York NY. 321 p.</ref>\n\nEspecially important in determining the response of white spruce to low temperatures is the physiological state of the various tissues, notably the degree of \"hardening\" or dormancy. A natural progression of hardening and dehardening occurs in concert with the seasons (Glerum 1985).<ref name=\"glerum1\">Glerum, C. 1985.

Newly flushed shoots of white spruce are very sensitive to spring frost (Smith 1949, Rowe 1955, McLeod 1964).<ref name=\"smith\">Smith, B.J. 1949. Silvicultural work at the Sault Ste.

Simulating the role of climate change and species imiigration in forest succession. p. 154\u2013178 ''in'' West, D.C.; Shugart, H.H.; Botkin, D.B. (Eds.). Forest Succession: Concepts and Application. Springer-Verlag, New York NY.</ref> First, classical definitions generally connote directional changes in species composition and community structure through time, yet the time frame needed for documentation of change far exceeds an average lifespan (Solomon et al. 1981).<ref name=\"solo\" /> The second feature that defies quantitative description is the end point or climax.\n\nFloodplain deposits in the Northwest Territory, Canada, are important in relation to the development of productive forest types with a component of [[white spruce]] (Jeffrey 1964).<ref name=\"jeff2\"/> The most recently exposed surfaces are occupied by sandbar vegetation or riparian shrub willows and alder (''Alnus incana''); with increasing elevation, the shrubs give way successively to [[Populus balsamifera|balsam poplar]] and white spruce forest. In contrast, older floodplains, with predominantly brown wooded soils, typically carry white spruce\u2013[[Populus tremuloides|trembling aspen]] mixedwood forest.\n\nInterrelationships among nutrient cycling, regeneration, and subsequent forest development on floodplains in interior Alaska were addressed by Van Cleve et al. (1980),<ref name=\"van1\">Van Cleve, K.; Dyrness, R.; Viereck, L. 1980. Nutrient cycling in interior Alaska flood plains. p. 11\u201318 ''in'' Murray, M.; Van Veldhuizen, R.M. (Eds.). Proc. Workshop, Fairbanks, Alaska, Nov. 1979. USDA, For. Serv., Pacific Northwest For. Exp. Sta., Portland OR, Gen. Tech. Rep., PNW-107. 52 p.</ref> who pointed out that the various stages in primary succession reflect physical, chemical, and biological controls of ecosystem structure and function. Thus, each successional stage has a species combination in harmony with site quality. Short-circuiting succession by planting a late successional species such as white spruce on an early successional surface may result in markedly reduced growth rates because of [[Nitrogen deficiency|nitrogen insufficiency]]. Without application of substantial amounts of fertilizer, use would have to be made of early successional alder and its site-ameliorating additions of nitrogen.\n\nNeiland and Viereck noted that \u201cthe slow establishment and growth of spruce under birch stands [in Alaska] may be partially due to effects of shading and general competition for water and nutrients, but may also be more directly related to the [[birch]] itself.

Alaska, Fairbanks AK, Sept. 1977.</ref>\n\nOn dry upland sites, especially south-facing slopes, the mature vegetation is white spruce, white birch, trembling aspen, or a combination of these species. Succession follows in one of two general patterns. In most cases, aspen and birch develop as a successional stage after [[Wildfire|fire]] before reaching the spruce stage. But, occasionally, with optimal site conditions and a source of seed, white spruce will invade with the [[hardwood]]s or within a few years thereafter, thereby producing even-aged white spruce stands without an intervening hardwood stage.\n\n== Associated forest cover ==\nThe White Spruce Cover Type may include other species in small numbers. In Alaska, associates include paper birch, trembling aspen, balsam poplar, and black spruce; in western Canada, additional associates are subalpine fir, balsam fir, Douglas-fir, jack pine, and lodgepole pine (Dyrness 1980).<ref name=\"vier1\">Dyrness, C.T. 1980.

On certain river bottom sites, however, black spruce may replace white spruce (Viereck 1970a).<ref name=\"vier1\"/> Earlier successional stages leading to the white spruce climax are the white spruce\u2013paper birch, white spruce\u2013aspen, balsam poplar, jack pine, and lodgepole pine types. The type shows little variation. The forest is generally closed and the trees well formed, other than those close to the timberline. Lesser vegetation in mature stands is dominated by [[moss]]es. [[Vascular plant]]s are typically few, but [[shrub]]s and [[herb]]s that occur \u201cwith a degree of regularity\u201d include: alder, willows, mountain cranberry, red-fruit bearberry, black crowberry, prickly rose, currant, buffaloberry, blueberry species, bunchberry, twinflower, tall lungwort, northern comandra, horsetail, bluejoint grass, sedge species, as well as ground-dwelling [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s. Several white spruce communities have been identified in interior Alaska: white spruce/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/sphagnum; white spruce/avens/moss; and white spruce/alder/bluejoint (Viereck 1975, Dyrness 1980).<ref>Viereck, L.A. 1975.

It shares the common name creeping pine with several [[Creeping pine|other \"creeping pine\" plants]].\n\nThe whitebark pine is typically the highest-elevation [[pine]] tree of these mountains, marking the [[tree line]]. Thus, it is often found as ''[[krummholz]]'', trees dwarfed by exposure and growing close to the ground. In more favourable conditions, trees may grow to up to {{convert|29|m|sp=us}} in height.\n\n==Characteristics==\nWhitebark pine (''Pinus albicaulis'') is a member of the [[Pinus classification|white pine]] group, ''[[Pinus]]'' subgenus ''[[Strobus]]'', section ''[[Strobus]]'' and like all members of that group, the [[leaf|leaves]] ('needles') are in fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. This distinguishes whitebark pine and relatives from the [[lodgepole pine|lodgepole pine (''Pinus contorta'')]], with two needles per fascicle, and [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pine (''Pinus ponderosa'')]] and [[Jeffrey pine|Jeffrey pine (''Pinus jeffreyi'')]], which both have three per fascicle; these three all also have a persistent sheath at the base of each fascicle.\n\nDistinguishing whitebark pine (''Pinus albicaulis''), from the related [[Limber pine|limber pine (''Pinus flexilis'')]], also a \"white pine\", is much more difficult, and needs seed or pollen [[conifer cone|cones]]. In ''Pinus albicaulis'', the cones are {{convert|4|-|7|cm|sp=us}}  long, dark purple when immature, and do not open on drying, but the scales easily break when they are removed by [[Clark's nutcracker]] (see below) to harvest the seeds; rarely are there intact old cones under them. Its pollen cones are scarlet.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roady|first1=Laura|title=Whitebark Pine|url=http://fwp.mt.gov/mtoutdoors/HTML/articles/portraits/whitebarkpine.htm|website=Montana Outdoors|publisher=Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks|accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn ''Pinus flexilis'', the cones are {{convert|6|-|12|cm|sp=us}} long, green when immature, and open to release the seeds; the scales are not fragile. Usually there are intact old cones under them. Their pollen cones are yellow.\n\n[[File:2013-07-12 15 55 36 Whitebark Pine pollen cones on Copper Mountain, Nevada.jpg|thumb|left|''Pinus albicaulis'' pollen cones]]\nWhitebark pine (''Pinus albicaulis'') can also be hard to distinguish from [[Western white pine|western white pine (''Pinus monticola'')]] in the absence of cones. However, whitebark pine needles are entire (smooth when rubbed gently in either direction), whereas western white pine needles are finely serrated (feeling rough when rubbed gently from tip to base). Whitebark pine needles are also usually shorter, {{convert|4|-|7|cm|sp=us}} long, overlapping in size with the larger {{convert|5|-|10|cm|sp=us}} needles of the western white pine.\n\n==Source of food==\n[[File:WhitebarkPine 7467t.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The whitebark pine, ''Pinus albicaulis'', at [[Mount Rainier National Park]]]]\nThe whitebark pine is an important source of food for many [[granivorous]] birds and small mammals, including most importantly the [[Clark's nutcracker]], the major seed disperser of the pine. Clark's nutcrackers each cache about 30,000 to 100,000&nbsp;each year in small, widely scattered caches usually under {{convert|2|to|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} of soil or gravelly substrate. Nutcrackers retrieve these seed caches during times of food scarcity and to feed their young. Cache sites selected by nutcrackers are often favorable for germination of seeds and survival of seedlings. Those caches not retrieved by the time the snow melts contribute to forest regeneration. Consequently, whitebark pine often grows in clumps of several trees, originating from a single cache of 2\u201315 or more seeds. [[Douglas squirrel]]s cut down and store whitebark pine cones in their [[midden]]s.  [[Grizzly bear]]s and [[American black bear]]s often raid squirrel middens for whitebark pine seeds, an important pre-hibernation food. Squirrels, [[northern flicker]]s, and [[mountain bluebird]]s often nest in whitebark pines, and elk and [[blue grouse]] use whitebark pine communities as summer habitat.\n\n==Threats==\n[[File:Tuolumne Meadows - Pywiack Dome summit - old pine - 2.JPG|thumb|left|''Pinus albicaulis'' is the only type of tree on the summit of [[Pywiack Dome]] in [[Yosemite National Park]].]]\nSevere population decline in whitebark pine communities is attributed to blister rust, the recent outbreak of mountain pine beetle (2000-2014), fire suppression, forest succession, wildland fire, and climate change.  A study in the mid-2000s showed that whitebark pine had declined by 41&nbsp;percent in the Western Cascades due to two threats: [[Cronartium ribicola|white pine blister rust]] and [[mountain pine beetle]]s.<ref name=\"seattle2011\"/> Whitebark deaths in [[North Cascades National Park]] doubled from 2006 to 2011.<ref name=\"seattle2011\"/>\n[[File:2013-07-12 13 42 54 Gnarled Whitebark Pine in the Copper Mountains of Nevada.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Stunted ''Pinus albicaulis'' in the [[Copper Mountains (Nevada)|Copper Mountains]] of northeastern Nevada]]\n\n===White pine blister rust===\n{{Further information|Cronartium ribicola}}\nMany stands of ''Pinus albicaulis'' nearly range-wide are infected with [[Cronartium ribicola|white pine blister rust (''Cronartium ribicola'')]], a fungal disease that was introduced from Europe. In the northern Rocky Mountains of the U.S., whitebark pine mortality in some areas exceeds 90&nbsp;percent, where the disease infests {{convert|143000|acre|km2}}.  ''Cronartium ribicola'' occurs in whitebark pine to the northern limits of the species in the coastal ranges of British Columbia and the Canadian Rocky Mountains. The blister rust has also devastated the commercially valuable western white pine in these areas, and made serious inroads in limber pine (''Pinus flexilis'') populations as well.  Nearly 80&nbsp;percent of whitebark pines in [[Mount Rainier National Park]] are infected with blister rust.<ref name=\"seattle2011\"/>\n\nThere is currently no way to stop the spread and effects of blister rust. However, a small number of trees (fewer than 5%) in most populations harbor genetic resistance to blister rust. There have been some restoration efforts by the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, and National Park Service in the northern Rocky Mountains.  [[Restoration ecology|Restoration]] efforts involve harvesting cones from potentially and known resistant whitebark pines, growing seedlings, and outplanting seedlings in suitable sites.\n\nIn California, where the blister rust is far less severe, whitebark pine are still fairly common in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|High Sierras]].\n\n===Mountain pine beetle===\nThere are widespread outbreaks of [[mountain pine beetle]] in the western U.S. and Canada.<ref name=\"Moore2008\">{{cite book |author1=Moore, Gerry |author2=Kershner, Bruce |author3=Craig Tufts |author4=Daniel Mathews |author5=Gil Nelson |author6=Spellenberg, Richard |author7=Thieret, John W. |author8=Terry Purinton |author9=Block, Andrew |title=National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Trees of North America |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |year=2008 |page=80 |isbn=1-4027-3875-7}}</ref>  Since 2000, the climate at high elevations has warmed enough for the beetles to reproduce within whitebark pine, often completing their life cycle within one year and enabling their populations to grow exponentially.

It appears in the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[Colorado]] and northern [[New Mexico]], with an isolated population in the [[San Francisco Peaks]] in [[Arizona]]. It is usually found at very high altitudes, from 7,000' \u2013 13,000',<ref>http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/highelevationwhitepines/About/dist.htm</ref> in cold, dry [[subalpine climate]] conditions, often at the [[tree line]], although it also forms extensive closed-canopy stands at somewhat lower elevations.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Bristleconeflagstaff.jpg|thumb|left|A [[grove (nature)|grove]] of isolated Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine]]\n\n''Pinus aristata'' is a medium-size [[tree]], reaching {{convert|8|-|20|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|10|-|15|ft|m|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide.<ref>https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/all/pinus-aristata/</ref>  Mature trunk diameter is highly variable.  The bark is grey-brown, thin and scaly at the base of the trunk. The [[leaf|leaves]] ('needles') are in fascicles of five, stout, 2.5\u20134&nbsp;cm long, deep green to blue-green on the outer face, with [[stomata]] confined to a bright white band on the inner surfaces. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are ovoid-cylindrical, 5\u201310&nbsp;cm long and 3\u20134&nbsp;cm broad when closed, purple at first, ripening yellow-buff when 16 months old, with numerous thin, fragile scales, each scale with a bristle-like spine 4\u20138&nbsp;mm long.\n\nThe cones open to 4\u20136&nbsp;cm broad when mature, releasing the [[seed]]s immediately after opening. The seeds are 5&nbsp;mm long, with a 10\u201320&nbsp;mm wing; they are mostly dispersed by the wind, but some are also dispersed by [[Clark's Nutcracker]]s, which pluck the seeds out of the opening cones. The nutcrackers use the seeds as a food resource, storing many for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new plants.\n\n[[File:Pinus Aristata raisin flecks.JPG|thumb|left|[[Pine needle|Needles]] with the typical [[resin]] flecks]]\nIt differs most conspicuously from the two other bristlecone pine species in that the needles usually have only one, (only rarely two) resin canals, and these are commonly interrupted and broken, leading to highly characteristic small white resin flecks appearing on the needles. This character, which looks a bit like '[[dandruff]]' on the needles, is diagnostic of ''Pinus aristata''; no other pine shows it (though sometimes, [[scale insect]] infestations can look superficially similar).\n\nIt is a long-lived tree, though not attaining the longevity of ''[[Pinus longaeva]]''. The oldest known tree, which grows high on [[Black Mountain (near Craig, Colorado)|Black Mountain]] in Colorado, was found to have at 2,435-year tree ring record (and overall estimated age of 2,480 years, per Craig Brunstein) in 1992.<ref name=\"Moore2008\">{{cite book |author1=Moore, Gerry |author2=Kershner, Bruce |author3=Craig Tufts |author4=Daniel Mathews |author5=Gil Nelson |author6=Spellenberg, Richard |author7=Thieret, John W. |author8=Terry Purinton |author9=Block, Andrew |title=National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Trees of North America |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |year=2008 |page=823 |isbn=1-4027-3875-7}}</ref> However, trees rarely live over 1,500 years.\n\nThis species was previously described as a subspecies of ''[[Pinus balfouriana]]'' (''Pinus balfouriana aristata''). ''Pinus aristata'' is currently regarded as one of three closely related species known as [[bristlecone pine]]s and is sometimes named Rocky Mountains bristlecone pine or Colorado bristlecone pine.\nIn addition to its informal and regional names, the trees are referred to as the foxtail pine or hickory pine.\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Pinus aristata'' is by far the most common of the bristlecone pines in cultivation, where it is a very attractive slow-growing small tree suitable for small [[garden]]s in cold climates. Even so, it is never as long-lived as in the wild, typically living less than 100 years before it succumbs to root decay in the warmer, moister conditions prevalent in most inhabited places.\n\n==References and external links==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{IUCN2006|assessor=Conifer Specialist Group|year=1998|id=34057|title=Pinus aristata|downloaded=11 May 2006}}\n{{Commons|Pinus aristata}}\n\n*[http://www.conifers.org/pi/pin/aristata.htm Gymnosperm Database: ''Pinus aristata'']\n*[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233500922 Flora of North America: ''Pinus aristata'']\n*[http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/highelevationwhitepines/trees/RM-bristlecone.htm High-elevation white pine educational website: ''Pinus aristata'']\n*[http://hikearizona.com/dexcoder.php?PID=1614 HikeArizona.COM Images: ''Pinus aristata'']\n*[http://www.pinetum.org/cones/PNDucampopinus.htm Photo of cone (scroll to bottom of page)]\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=PIAR USDA Plants Profile: ''Pinus aristata'']\n\n[[Category:Pinus|aristata]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Rocky Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Near threatened flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Drought-tolerant plants]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]",

''latifolia'' forest 23 years before (above) and 10 years after (below) the [[Yellowstone fires of 1988]]}}\n\n''Pinus contorta'' is a fire-dependent species, requiring [[wildfire]]s to maintain healthy populations of diverse ages. The bark of the lodgepole pine is fairly thin, minimizing the tree's defense to fire; however, the heat of these [[closed-cone pine forest]] rejuvenating fires open the cones to release the seeds. This allows the species to regenerate and maintain its place in the forest habitat.<ref name=Schoennagel />\n\nExcessive wildfire prevention disrupts the [[fire ecology]]. The stands are usually so densely populated that the trees self-thin, or out-compete each other, leaving dead trees standing. These become a dry [[ladder fuel]] that can accelerate the fire to the crown of living trees. When the fire reaches the crowns of the trees, it can jump from tree to tree and becomes relatively unstoppable.\n\nThe natural fire regime for this species is primarily driven by climate. The fires occur most often after years of drought. ''Pinus contorta'' occurs from the upper montane to the subalpine region. These types of forests experience a lot of moisture in the form of snow in the winter due to their altitude. The density of the tree stand also prohibits the establishment of an understory. With all of that being said, the likelihood of a surface fire occurring is rare. Thus, infrequent but severe fires dominate this species.<ref name=Schoennagel>{{cite journal|last=Schoennagel|first=Tania|author2=Thomas Veblen |title=The Interaction of Fire, Fuels and Climate across Rocky Mountain Forests|journal=BioScience|volume=54|issue=7|year=2004|pages=661\u201376|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0661:TIOFFA]2.0.CO;2|issn=0006-3568}}</ref>\n\nAn example of the climate that plays a huge role in the fire regime of ''Pinus contorta'' is quite complex. There are three different oscillations that play a major role in droughts. These are the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) and El Nino (ENSO).

A typical tipi is constructed using 15 to 18 pines.  The long, straight, and lightweight characteristics of the species made it ideal for horse transport in nomadic Plains [[buffalo hunting]] cultures.  Tribes made long journeys across the [[Great Plains]] to secure lodgepole pines that only grew in mountainous areas.  In Minnesota, other species such as [[red pine]] would be used in tipis, though they were generally thicker, heavier, and more cumbersome to transport than ''Pinus contorta''.\n\n''Pinus contorta'' is still used by many today for erecting tipis on [[American Indian reservation]]s, at [[powwow]]s, and at private homes.  The trees may be harvested for tipi poles in U.S. National Forests, provided the harvester secured a permit to cut living trees for ceremonial or traditional purposes.  The [[Bighorn Mountains]], the [[Black Hills]], and the [[Medicine Bow Mountains]] are popular tipi pole harvesting areas for Native Americans living on [[Plains Indians]] reservations in North and South Dakota, and immigrant tipi enthusiasts.\n\n=== Medicinal ===\nThe [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest]] and [[Indigenous peoples of California|of California]] used different parts of the plant internally and externally as a [[traditional medicine]] for various ailments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Pinus+contorta|title=results of search|work=umich.edu}}</ref>\n\n=== Cultivation ===\n''Pinus contorta'' is cultivated as an [[ornamental tree]] by the [[horticulture]] industry. [[plant nursery|Plant nurseries]] grow ''Pinus contorta'' subsp. ''contorta'' and ''Pinus contorta'' subsp. ''murrayana'' for use in traditional and [[wildlife garden]]s, and as smaller selections of the [[native plant]] for [[natural landscaping]]. The Shore pine's (ssp. ''contorta'') smaller varieties and cultivars are also used in [[container garden]]ing, including as large [[bonsai]] specimens.\n\n[[Cultivars]] of this species include:\n\n* ''Chief Joseph'', a dwarf variety of ''Pinus contorta var. latifolia'' grown for its yellow winter needles.\n* ''Spaan's Dwarf'', a dwarf variety of ''Pinus contorta var. contorta'' that grows wider than it grows tall.\n\n=== Emblem ===\nLodgepole pine is the [[Provincial tree emblems of Canada|Provincial tree]] of Alberta, Canada.\n\n== Invasive species ==\n''Pinus contorta'' is a serious [[invasive species]] of [[wilding conifer]] in [[New Zealand]], along with several other western North American pine species. It is listed on the [[National Pest Plant Accord]] and is prohibited from sale, commercial propagation, and distribution.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal bar|Trees}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n* {{Silvics |volume=1 |genus=Pinus |species=contorta |first1=James E. |last1=Lotan |first2=William B. |last2=Critchfield}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons+cat|Pinus contorta}}\n{{Wikispecies|Pinus contorta|''Pinus contorta''}}\n* {{PLANTS|symbol=PICO|Pinus contorta}}\n* [http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_IJM.pl?tid=38264 Jepson eFlora treatment of ''Pinus contorta'']\n* [http://www4.uwsp.edu/geo/projects/virtdept/ipvft/lodgep.html University of Wisconsin: Lodgepole forest webpage]\n* [http://dendro.cnre.vt.edu/dendrology/syllabus/factsheet.cfm?ID=177 Virginia Tech dendrology website: ''Pinus contorta'']\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/mar/19/usnews.conservationandendangeredspecies Guardian (U.K.) article: \"Plague of beetles raises climate change fears for American beauty\"]\n* {{CalPhotos|Pinus|contorta}}\n* [http://www.euforgen.org/species/picea-sitchensis/ ''Picea sitchensis''] - information, genetic conservation units and related resources.

In favourable conditions, it makes a tree to {{convert|20|m|ft|round=5|sp=us}}, rarely {{convert|25|m|ft|round=5|sp=us}} tall.  However, on exposed treeline sites, mature trees are much smaller, reaching heights of only {{convert|5|-|10|m|ft|round=5|sp=us}}.<ref name=\"Moore2008\" />  In steeply-sloping, rocky, and windswept terrain in the Rocky Mountains of southern Alberta, limber pine is even more stunted, occurring in old stands where mature trees are consistently less than {{convert|3|m|ft|0}} in height.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Letts|first1=M.G.|first2=K.N.|last2=Nakonechny|first3=K.E.|last3=Van Gaalen|first4=C.M.|last4=Smith|year=2009|url=http://people.uleth.ca/~matthew.letts/Letts%20et%20al%202009%20CJFR.pdf|title=Physiological acclimation of ''Pinus flexilis'' to drought stress on contrasting slope aspects in Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada|journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research|volume=39|issue=3|pages=629\u2013641|doi=10.1139/X08-206}}</ref>\n\nOne of the world's oldest living Limber Pine trees grows on the banks of the upper North Saskatchewan River at Whirlpool Point in Alberta.\nRecent measurements give a maximum girth of 185\".  In 1986 a core sample 10cm  was retrieved by two researchers who counted 400 rings.\nExtrapolating his data gives an age close to 3000 years.\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Limberpinecone.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Limber pine cone from [[San Jacinto Mountains]], [[Peninsular Ranges]]]]\n''P. flexilis'',  is an important source of food for several species, including [[pine squirrel|red squirrels]] and [[Clark's nutcracker]]s. [[American black bear]]s may raid squirrel caches for limber pine nuts. Squirrels, [[Northern flicker]]s, and [[mountain bluebird]]s often nest in the trees.\n\n== Related species ==\n''P. flexilis'' is a member of the [[Pinus classification|white pine]] group, ''[[Pinus]]'' subgenus ''[[Strobus]]'', and like all members of that group, the leaves ('needles') are in [[fascicle (botany)|fascicles]] (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. This distinguishes it from the [[lodgepole pine]], with two needles per fascicle, and the [[bristlecone pine]]s, which share five needles per fascicle but have a semi-persistent sheath.\n[[File:Pinus flexilis male cones.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Male cones of a limber pine, eastern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], California]]\n\n=== ''Pinus albicaulis'' ===\nDistinguishing limber pine from the related [[whitebark pine]] (''P. albicaulis''), also a white pine, is very much more difficult, and can only easily be done by the cones. In limber pine, the cones are {{convert|6-12|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long where the species overlap, green when immature, and open to release the seeds; the scales are not fragile. In whitebark pine, the cones are {{convert|4|-|7|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long, dark purple when immature, and do not open on drying, but are fragile and are pulled apart by birds (see below) to release the seeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pinetum.org/cones/PNStrobus.htm|title=''Pinus'' subgenus ''Strobus''|work=Michael P. Frank's Cone Collection|publisher=Arboretum de Villardebelle}}</ref> A useful clue is that whitebark pines almost never have intact old cones lying under them, whereas limber pines usually do.\n<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roady|first1=Laura|title=Whitebark Pine|url=http://fwp.mt.gov/mtoutdoors/HTML/articles/portraits/whitebarkpine.htm|website=Montana Outdoors|publisher=Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks|accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Pinus monticola'' ===\nIn the absence of cones, limber pine can also be hard to tell from [[Western white pine]] (''P. monticola'') where they occur together in the northern Rockies and the Sierra Nevada east slope. The most useful clue here is that limber pine needles are entire (smooth when rubbed gently in both directions), whereas Western white pine needles are finely serrated (feeling rough when rubbed gently from tip to base). Limber pine needles are also usually shorter, {{convert|4|-|7|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long, while western white pine needles are {{convert|5|-|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}}, though the ranges overlap.\n\n== Diseases ==\nLimber pine is susceptible to [[white pine blister rust]], caused by ''Cronartium ribicola'', a fungus that was introduced accidentally from Europe. Limber pine mortality is high in many areas throughout its range, except [[Arizona]], where it has not yet been found. However, there is little hope of controlling the blister rust in existing trees. Research is under way, locating and breeding from the occasional naturally resistant limber pines, and by studying the resistance mechanisms of the European and Asian white pines (e.g. [[Swiss pine]], [[Macedonian pine]]), which are strongly resistant to the disease.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nThe popular [[cultivar]] ''P. flexilis'' 'Vanderwolf's Pyramid' is widely available as an [[ornamental tree]] for [[garden]]s. 'Vanderwolf's Pyramid' derives from ''P. reflexa'', though it is usually listed in nursery catalogs under ''P. flexilis''.\n\nThe Southwestern white pine is popular as a windbreak tree or an ornamental tree due to its drought tolerance.  It is also grown as a [[Christmas tree]], liked for the soft needles but with stiffer branches than an [[Eastern white pine]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Burmis Tree]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Further reading ===\n* {{cite book | last1 = Chase| first1 = J.

The range is in southernmost [[Idaho]], western [[Utah]], [[Arizona]], southwest [[New Mexico]], [[Nevada]], eastern and southern [[California]] and northern [[Baja California]].\n\nIt occurs at moderate altitudes from {{convert|1200|m|ft|sing=on}} - {{convert|2300|m|ft|sing=on}}, rarely as low as {{convert|950|m|ft|sing=on}} and as high as {{convert|2900|m|ft|sing=on}}. It is widespread and often abundant in this region, forming extensive open woodlands, often mixed with [[juniper]]s in the [[Pinyon-juniper woodland]] [[plant community]]. Single-leaf Pinyon is the world's only 1-needled pine.<ref name=\"Moore2008\">Gerry Moore et al. 2008</ref>\n\n[[File:2013-06-27 14 53 26 Single-leaf Pinyon on Spruce Mountain, Nevada.jpg|thumb|''Pinus monophylla'' on [[Spruce Mountain (Nevada)|Spruce Mountain]], Nevada]]\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Pinyon pine Pinus monophylla needles close.jpg|left|thumb|170px|''Pinus monophylla'', closeup of the single needle in each sheath]]\n\n===Species===\n[[Image:Pinyon pine cones Pinus monophylla.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Pinyon pine 2-year cone cycle]]\n''Pinus monophylla'' is a small to medium size [[tree]], reaching {{convert|10|m|ft|sing=on}}-{{convert|20|m|ft|sing=on}} tall and with a trunk diameter of up to {{convert|80|cm|in|sing=on}} rarely more. The bark is irregularly furrowed and scaly. The [[leaf|leaves]] ('needles') are, uniquely for a pine, usually single (not two or more in a fascicle, though trees with needles in pairs are found occasionally), stout, {{convert|4|cm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|6|cm|in|sing=on}} long, and grey-green to strongly glaucous blue-green, with [[stomata]] over the whole needle surface (and on both inner and outer surfaces of paired needles). The [[conifer cone|cones]] are acute-globose, the largest of the true pinyons, {{convert|4.5|cm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|8|cm|in|sing=on}} long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-buff when 18\u201320 months old, with only a small number of very thick scales, typically 8-20 fertile scales. The cones thus grow over a two-year (26-month) cycle, so that newer green and older, seed-bearing or open brown cones are on the tree at the same time (see image at left).\n\n[[Image:Pinyon with pine nuts in cone.jpg|right|thumb|190px|Open cone with empty pine nuts]]\nThe cones open to {{convert|6|cm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|9|cm|in|sing=on}} broad when mature, holding the [[seed]]s on the scales after opening. The seeds are {{convert|11|mm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|16|mm|in|sing=on}} long, with a thin shell, a white [[endosperm]], and a vestigial {{convert|1|mm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|2|mm|in|sing=on}} wing. Empty pine nuts with undeveloped seeds (self-pollinated) are a light tan color, while the \"good\" ones are dark brown.<ref name=\"Lanner1981\">Ronald M. Lanner 1981</ref> The pine nuts are dispersed by the [[pinyon jay]], which plucks the seeds out of the open cones, choosing only the dark ones and leaving the light ones (as in image at right).  The jay, which uses the seeds as a food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use by burying them. Some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees.  Indeed, Pinyon seeds will rarely germinate in the wild unless they are cached by jays or other animals.\n\n===Subspecies and genetics===\n\nThere are three subspecies:\n*''Pinus monophylla'' subsp. ''monophylla''. Most of the range, except for the areas below. Needles more stout, bright blue-green, with 2-7 resin canals and 8-16 stomatal lines. Cones are {{convert|5.5|cm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|8|cm|in|sing=on}} long, often longer than broad.\n[[Image:Pinyon snowSilh.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Mature Pinus monophylla subsp. monophylla in snow, Mono Co.

Southernmost Nevada, southwest through southeastern California (northwest only as far as the [[San Jacinto Mountains]]) to 29\u00b0N in northern Baja California. Needles less stout, gray-green, with 8-16 resin canals and 13-18 stomatal lines. Cones are {{convert|4.5|cm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|6|cm|in|sing=on}} long, broader than long.\n*''Pinus monophylla'' subsp. ''fallax'' (E. L. Little) D.K. Bailey. Slopes of the lower [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] valley and adjacent tributaries from [[St. George, Utah]] to the [[Hualapai Mountains]], and along the lower flank of the [[Mogollon Rim]] to [[Silver City, New Mexico]]. Needles less stout, gray-green, with 2-3 resin canals and 8-16 stomatal lines. Cones are {{convert|4.5|cm|in|sing=on}} - {{convert|6|cm|in|sing=on}} long, broader than long.\n\nIt is most closely related to the [[Colorado pinyon]], which [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridises]] with it (both subsps. ''monophylla'' and ''fallax'') occasionally where their ranges meet in western Arizona and Utah. It also (subsp. ''californiarum'') hybridises extensively with [[Parry pinyon]].  This classification of pinyon species based only upon the presence of single-needle fascicles is brought into doubt by the reporting of trees from both the Pinus monophylla/Pinus edulis and the Pinus monophylla subsp. fallax/Pinus edulis zones as growing more single needle fascicles after dry years and more two-needled fascicles after wet years.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tausch|first1=R.J.|last2=West|first2=N.E.|editor=Everett, R.L.

When the [[railroad]]s penetrated these areas, imported [[coal]] supplanted locally produced charcoal.\n\nFollowing the resulting re-establishment of pinyon woodlands after the charcoal era, many [[cattle]] [[rancher]]s became concerned that these woodlands provided decreased [[livestock]] [[Fodder|forage]] in [[grazing]] [[rangeland]].  Efforts to clear these woodlands, with [[deforestation]] often using a surplus [[battleship]] chain dragged between two [[bulldozer]]s, peaked in the 1950s, but were subsequently abandoned when no long term forage increase resulted.  The [[habitat destruction]] of large areas of Pinyon woodlands in the interests of [[mining]] and cattle ranching is seen by many as an act of major ecological and cultural vandalism.<ref name=\"Lanner1981\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pinyon pine]]s\n*[[Pinyon-juniper woodland]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* C.

The [[bark]] helps to distinguish it from other species. Mature to over-mature individuals have yellow to orange-red bark in broad to very broad plates with black crevices. Younger trees have blackish-brown bark, referred to as \"blackjacks\" by early loggers. Ponderosa pine's five [[subspecies]], as classified by some botanists, can be identified by their characteristically bright, green needles (contrasting with blue-green needles that distinguish [[Jeffrey pine]]). The Pacific subspecies has the longest\u2014{{convert|19.8|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}\u2014and most flexible needles in plume-like [[Fascicle (botany)|fascicles]] of three. The Columbia ponderosa pine has long\u2014{{convert|12.0|\u2013|20.5|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}\u2014and relatively flexible needles in fascicles of three. The Rocky Mountains subspecies has shorter\u2014{{convert|9.2|\u2013|14.4|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}\u2014and stout needles growing in scopulate (bushy, tuft-like) fascicles of two or three. The southwestern subspecies has {{convert|11.2|\u2013|19.8|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}, stout needles in fascicles of three (averaging {{convert|2.7|\u2013|3.5|in|disp=flip|abbr=on}}). The central High Plains subspecies is characterized by the fewest needles (1.4 per whorl, on average); stout, upright branches at narrow angles from the trunk; and long green needles\u2014{{convert|14.8|\u2013|17.9|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}\u2014extending farthest along the branch, resembling a fox tail.

The [[bark]] is silvery-white, smooth or lightly fissured when young, becoming dark gray and deeply fissured on old trees. The twigs are grayish-yellow and stout, with large triangular leaf scars. The winter buds are slender, pointed, {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|in|frac=4}} long, yellowish brown, and resinous. It is one of the fastest growing trees in North America.

The leaf is very coarsely toothed, the teeth are curved and gland tipped, and the petiole is flat; they are dark green in the summer and turn yellow in the fall (but many cottonwoods in dry locations drop their leaves early from the combination of drought and leaf rust, making their fall color dull or absent).

A clone may turn color earlier or later in the fall than its neighbouring aspen clones. Fall colors are usually bright tones of yellow; in some areas, red blushes may be occasionally seen.

Aspens do produce seeds, but seldom grow from them. Pollination is inhibited by the fact that aspens are either male or female, and large stands are usually all clones of the same sex. Even if pollinated, the small seeds (three million per pound) are only viable a short time as they lack a stored food source or a protective coating.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\">Ewing, Susan. The Great Alaska Nature Factbook. Portland: Alaska Northwest Books, 1996.</ref>\n\n=== Dieback ===\nBeginning in 1996, individual North American scientists noticed an increase in dead or dying aspen trees. As this accelerated in 2004, word spread and a debate over causes began. No insect, disease, or environmental condition is yet specifically identified as a joint cause. Trees adjacent to one another are often stricken or not. In other instances, entire groves have died.\n\nMany areas of the Western US have experienced increased diebacks which are often attributed to ungulate grazing and [[wildfire suppression]]. At high altitudes where grasses can be rare, [[ungulate]]s can browse young aspen sprouts and prevent those young trees from reaching maturity. As a result, some aspen groves close to cattle or other grazing animals, such as deer or elk, have very few young trees and can be invaded by [[conifers]], which are not typically browsed. Another possible deterrent to aspen regeneration is widespread wildfire suppression.  Aspens are vigorous [[resprouter]]s and even though the above-ground portion of the organism may die in a wild-fire, the roots, which are often protected from lethal temperatures during a fire, will sprout new trees soon after a fire.  Disturbances such as fires seem to be a necessary ecological event in order for aspens to compete with conifers, which tend to replace aspen over long, disturbance-free intervals.  The current dieback in the American West may have roots in the strict fire suppression policy in the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} On the other hand, the widespread decimation of conifer forests by the [[mountain pine beetle]] may provide increased opportunities for aspen groves to proliferate under the right conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112713000352 | doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2013.01.008 | volume=299 | title=How will aspen respond to mountain pine beetle? A review of literature and discussion of knowledge gaps | journal=Forest Ecology and Management | pages=60\u201369}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the vegetative regeneration method of reproduction used by the aspen, where an entire group of trees are essentially clones, there is a concern that something that hits one will eventually kill all of the trees, presuming they share the same vulnerability. A conference was held in Utah in September 2006 to share notes and consider investigative methodology.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/26/science/earth/26aspen.html | work=The New York Times | first=Katie | last=Kelley | title=Emblem of the West Is Dying, and No One Can Figure Out Why | date=26 September 2006}}</ref>\n[[File:Populus tremuloides 8163.jpg|thumb|Typical yellow autumn foliage]]\n[[File:2014-10-05 14 33 30 Aspens showing autumn foliage coloration in Lamoille Canyon, Nevada.JPG|thumb|right|Atypical orange and red autumn foliage]]\n\n== Uses ==\nAspen bark contains a substance that was extracted by indigenous North Americans and European settlers of the western U.S. as a [[quinine]] substitute.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\" />\n\nLike other poplars, aspens make poor [[fuel wood]], as they dry slowly, rot quickly, and do not give off much heat. Yet they are still widely used in campgrounds because they are cheap and plentiful and not widely used in building lumber. Pioneers in the North American west used them to create [[log cabins]] and [[dugout (shelter)|dugouts]], though they were not the preferred species.\n\nThe leaves of the quaking aspen and other species in the genus ''Populus'' serve as food for [[caterpillar]]s of various moths and butterflies. See [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on poplars]].\n\nIn Canada, quaking aspen wood is used mainly for pulp products such as books, newsprint, and fine printing paper. It is especially good for panel products such as [[oriented strand board]] and [[waferboard]]. It is light in weight and is used for furniture, boxes and crates, core stock in plywood, and wall panels.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons and category-inline}}\n* {{Wikispecies-inline}}\n* [http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/poptre/all.html US Forest Service Fire Effects Information System: ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* [http://www.abtreegene.com/trees.html Alberta Forest Genetic Resources Council: ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/populus-tremuloides-quaking-aspen-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map for ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* {{ITIS |id=195773 |taxon=Populus tremuloides |accessdate=8 August 2006}}\n* Farrar, John Laird.

It is used for [[timber]], and is notable as a [[model organism]] in [[plant biology]]. Its full [[genome]] sequence was published in 2006. It is the first tree species to be sequenced.\n\n== Description ==\nIt is a large tree, growing to a height of {{convert|30|m|ft}} to {{convert|50|m|ft}} and a trunk diameter of over {{convert|2|m|ft}}, which makes it the largest [[Populus|poplar]] species in the Americas. It is normally fairly short-lived, but some trees may live for up to 400 years (Forbes 2006). A cottonwood in [[Willamette Mission State Park]] near [[Salem, Oregon]] holds the national and world records. Last measured in April, 2008 this black cottonwood was found to be standing at {{convert|155|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall, {{convert|29|ft|m|abbr=on}} around, with 527 points.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ascendingthegiants.com/news/16/52/Black-Cottonwood.html|title=Ascending the Giants - Chronicles Of Measuring Champion Trees|website=ascendingthegiants.com|access-date=2016-07-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMHY48_Largest_Black_Cottonwood_Tree_in_the_United_States_Marion_County_Oregon|title=Largest Black Cottonwood Tree in the United States - Marion County, Oregon - Exceptional Trees on Waymarking.com|website=www.waymarking.com|access-date=2016-07-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ortravelexperience.com/oregon-heritage-trees/willamette-mission-cottonwood/|title=Willamette Mission Cottonwood - Oregon Travel Experience|website=ortravelexperience.com|access-date=2016-07-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.monumentaltrees.com/en/usa/oregon/marioncounty/11968_willamettemissionstatepark/|title=Black cottonwood 'Willamette Mission Cottonwood' in Willamette Mission State Park in Salem|website=www.monumentaltrees.com|access-date=2016-07-03}}</ref>\n\nThe [[bark]] is grey and covered with [[lenticel]]s, becoming thick and deeply fissured on old trees. The bark can become hard enough to cause sparks when cut with a chainsaw.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\">Ewing, Susan. The Great Alaska Nature Factbook. Portland: Alaska Northwest Books, 1996.</ref> The stem is grey in the older parts and light brown in younger parts. The [[crown (botany)|crown]] is usually roughly conical and quite dense. In large trees the lower branches droop downwards. [[Spur shoot]]s are common. The [[wood]] has a light coloring and a straight grain.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are 7\u201320&nbsp;cm long with a glossy dark green upper side and glaucous light grey-green underside; larger leaves, up to 30&nbsp;cm long, may be produced on stump sprouts and very vigorous young trees. The leaves are alternate, elliptic with a crenate margin and an acute tip, and reticulate venation (see [[Leaf#Terminology|leaf terminology]]). The petiole is reddish. The [[bud]]s are conical, long, narrow and sticky, with a strong balsam scent in spring when they open.\n\n''Populus trichocarpa'' has an extensive and aggressive root system, which can invade and damage drainage systems. Sometimes the roots can even damage the foundations of buildings by drying out the soil.\n\n=== Reproduction ===\n'''Flowering and fruiting'''\n[[File:Black cottonwood male catkin and leaf buds.JPG|right|thumb|Male (pollen-producing) catkin and leaf buds (March 22)[[Sherwood, Oregon|Sherwood]], Oregon, USA ]]\n\n''Populus trichocarpa'' is normally [[dioecious]]; [[male]] and [[female]] [[catkin]]s are borne on separate trees. The species reaches [[flowering]] age at about 10 years. Flowers may appear in early March to late May in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]], and sometimes as late as mid-June in northern and interior [[British Columbia]], [[Idaho]], and [[Montana]]. [[Stamen|Staminate]] [[catkin]]s contain 30 to 60 [[stamen]]s, elongate to 2 to 3&nbsp;cm, and are [[deciduous]]. [[Pistillate]] [[catkin]]s at maturity are 8 to 20&nbsp;cm long with [[Ovule|rotund-ovate]], three [[carpel]]late [[subsessile fruit]]s 5 to 8&nbsp;mm long. Each capsule contains many minute [[seed]]s with long, white cottony hairs.\n\n'''Seed production and dissemination'''\n\nThe seed ripens and is disseminated by late May to late June in [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], but frequently not until mid-July in [[Idaho]] and [[Montana]]. Abundant seed crops are usually produced every year. Attached to its cotton, the seed is light and buoyant and can be transported long distances by wind and water. Although highly viable, longevity of ''P. trichocarpa'' seed under natural conditions may be as short as two weeks to a month. This can be increased with cold storage.\n\n[[File:Seeds and Fluff of Cottonwood.jpg|right|thumb|Seeds and Fluff of Cottonwood (July 1, 2012) [[Boise]], Idaho, USA]]\n\n'''Seedling development'''\n\nMoist seedbeds are essential for high germination, and seedling survival depends on continuously favorable conditions during the first month. Wet bottom lands of rivers and major streams frequently provide such conditions, particularly where bare soil has been exposed or new soil laid down. Germination is [[epigeal germination|epigeal]]. ''P. trichocarpa'' seedlings do not usually become established in abundance after [[logging]] unless special measures are taken to prepare the bare, moist seedbeds required for initial establishment. Where seedlings become established in great numbers, they thin out naturally by age five because the weaker seedlings of this shade-intolerant [[species]] are suppressed.\n\n'''[[Vegetative reproduction]]'''\n\nDue to its high levels of rooting hormones, ''P. trichocarpa'' sprouts readily. After [[logging]] operations, it sometimes regenerates naturally from rooting of partially buried fragments of branches or from stumps. Sprouting from roots also occurs. The species also has the ability to [[abscission|abscise]] shoots complete with green leaves. These shoots drop to the ground and may root where they fall or may be dispersed by water transport. In some situations, abscission may be one means of colonizing exposed [[sandbar]]s.\n\n== Distribution ==\n{{double image|right|Blackcottonwoodfull.jpg|150|blackcottonwoodtrunk.jpg|200|A large specimen in [[Diamond Ridge, Alaska]], and a close-up of the bark at the base of the trunk}}\nThe native range of ''P. trichocarpa'' covers large sections of western [[North America]]. It extends northeast from [[Kodiak Island]] along [[Cook Inlet]] to [[latitude]] 62\u00b0 30\u00b0 N., then southeast in southeast [[Alaska]] and [[British Columbia]] to the forested areas of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]], to the mountains in southern [[California]] and northern [[Baja California]] (lat. 31\u00b0 N.). It is also found inland, generally on the west side of the [[Rocky Mountains]], in [[British Columbia]], western [[Alberta]], western [[Montana]], and northern [[Idaho]]. Scattered small populations have been noted in southeastern [[Alberta]], eastern [[Montana]], western [[North Dakota]], western [[Wyoming]], [[Utah]], and [[Nevada]]. It grows up to elevations of 2100 m.\n\n''Populus trichocarpa'' has been one of the most successful introduction of trees to the otherwise almost treeless [[Faroe Islands]].\n\nThe species was imported from Alaska to [[Iceland]] in 1944 and has since become one of the most widespread trees in the country.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nIt is also grown as an [[ornamental tree]], valued for its fast growth and scented foliage in spring, detectable from over 100 m distance. The roots are however invasive, and it can damage the foundations of buildings on shrinkable clay soils if planted nearby (Mitchel 1996).\n\nBranches can be added to potted plants to stimulate rooting.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\"/>\n\n== Use as a model species ==\n''Populus trichocarpa'' has several qualities which makes it a good model species for trees:\n* Model genome size (although significantly larger than the other model plant, ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'')\n* Rapid growth (for a tree)\n* Reaches reproductive maturity 4\u20136 years\n* Economically important\n* It represents a [[phenotype|phenotypically]] diverse genus\n\nFor these reasons the species has been extensively studied. Its [[genome]] sequence was published in 2006 (see \"Genome\" below). More than 121 000 [[expressed sequence tag]]s (ESTs) have been [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] from it. The wide range of topics studied by using ''P. trichocarpa'' include the effects of [[ethylene]], [[lignin]] [[biosynthesis]], drought tolerance and [[wood]] formation.\n\n== Uses ==\n\n=== Lumber ===\n''Populus trichocarpa'' wood is light-weight and although not particularly strong, is strong for its weight. The wood material has short, fine [[cellulose]] fibres which are used in the production of high-quality book and magazine [[paper]]. The wood is also excellent for production of [[plywood]]. Living [[tree]]s are used as [[windbreak]]s.\n\n''Populus trichocarpa'' grows very quickly; trees in [[plantation]]s in Great Britain have reached {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall in 11 years, and {{convert|34|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall in 28 years (Mitchell 1996). It can reach suitable size for [[Wood pulp|pulp]] production in 10\u201315 years and about 25 years for [[timber]] production.\n\n=== Medicinal ===\nNative American tribes in the Pacific Northwest used ''P. trichocarpa'' for a variety of purposes. The inner bark was sometimes eaten but most of its uses were medicinal or practical. Because of its [[salicin]] content it was often used raw or in salves to treat a number of ailments including baldness, tuberculosis, rheumatism, and treating wounds. The wood, roots and bark were used for firewood, canoe making, rope, fish traps, baskets and structures. The gum-like sap was even used as a glue or as waterproofing.<ref name=\"Pojar\">Pojar, J. & MacKinnon, A. Plants of the Pacific Northwest Coast. Vancouver, British Columbia: Lone Pine Publishing, 2004.</ref>\n\nCommercial extracts are produced from the fragrant buds for use as a perfume in medicines and cosmetics.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\"/>\n\n'Populus trichocarpa'' contains [[salicin]], and has been used medicinally as an [[antipyretic]], [[analgesic]] and to control [[inflammation]].\n\n== Genome ==\n\n=== Characteristics ===\n* Size: 485 million [[base pair]]s. (Human genome: 3 billion base pairs)\n* Proportion of [[heterochromatin]] to [[euchromatin]]: 3:7\n* Number of [[chromosome]]s: 19\n* Number of putative genes: 45,555, the largest number of genes ever recorded (estimate in September 2008)\n* [[Mitochondrion|Mitochondrial genome]]: 803,000 [[base pair]]s, 52 [[gene]]s\n* [[Chloroplast|Chloroplast genome]]: 157,000 [[base pair]]s, 101 [[gene]]s\n\n=== General information ===\nThe sequence of ''P. trichocarpa'' is that of an individual [[female]] specimen '''\"Nisqually-1\"''', named after the [[Nisqually River]] in the [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state in the United States, where the specimen was collected. The [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] was performed at the [[Joint Genome Institute]] by using the [[shotgun sequencing|shotgun]] method. The depth of the sequencing was approximately 7.5 x (meaning that each [[base pair]] was [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] on average 7.5 times). [[Genome annotation]] was done primarily by the [[Joint Genome Institute]], the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], the [[Ume\u00e5 Plant Science Centre]] and [[Genome Canada]].\n\nPrior to the publication of ''P. trichocarpa'' [[genome]] the only available plant genomes were those of [[Arabidopsis thaliana|thale cress]] and [[rice]], both of which are [[herbaceous]]. ''P. trichocarpa'' is the first woody plant [[genome]] to be sequenced. Considering the economic importance of [[wood]] and wood products, the availability of a tree [[genome]] was necessary. The sequence also allows evolutionary comparisons and the elucidation of basic molecular differences between [[herbaceous]] and woody plants.\n\nDoty et al. (2016) found the first direct evidence of N2 fixation in the wild ''P. trichocarpa'' (a non-leguminous tree).<ref>Doty, S. L., Sher, A. W., Fleck, N. D., Khorasani, M., Bumgarner, R. E., Khan, Z., ... & DeLuca, T. H. (2016). Variable nitrogen fixation in wild Populus. PLOS ONE, 11(5), e0155979.</ref>\n\n=== Somatic mosaicism ===\nGenome-wide analysis of 11 clumps of ''P. trichocarpa'' trees reveals significant genetic differences between the roots and the leaves and branches of the same tree. The variation within a specimen is as much as found between unrelated trees.<ref>{{cite news |last = Yong |first = Ed |title = Tree's leaves genetically different from its roots |newspaper = Nature News |date = 2012-08-10 |url = http://www.nature.com/news/tree-s-leaves-genetically-different-from-its-roots-1.11156 |accessdate = 2012-08-14 }}</ref> These results may be important in resolving debate in evolutionary biology regarding [[somatic mutation]] (that evolution can occur within individuals, not solely among populations), with a variety of implications.<ref>{{cite conference |first = Brett P. |last = Olds |author2=P.J.

It commonly lives more than 500 years and occasionally more than 1,200 years. The [[bark]] on young trees is thin, smooth, gray, and covered with resin blisters. On mature trees, it is moderately thick (3\u20136&nbsp;cm), furrowed and corky though much less so than coast Douglas-fir.\n\n[[File:2013-07-14 09 27 54 Douglas fir foliage along Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive in Great Basin National Park, Nevada.jpg|thumb|left|Foliage]]\nThe shoots are brown to gray-brown, smooth, though not as smooth as [[fir]] shoots, and finely pubescent with scattered short hairs. The [[bud]]s are a distinctive narrow conic shape, 3\u20136&nbsp;mm long, with red-brown bud scales. The leaves are spirally arranged but slightly twisted at the base to be upswept above the shoot, needle-like, 2\u20133&nbsp;cm long, gray-green to blue-green above with a single broad [[stomata]]l patch, and with two whitish stomatal bands below.\n\nThe male ([[pollen]]) cones are 2\u20133&nbsp;cm long, and are typically restricted to or more abundant on lower branches. Pollen cones develop over 1 year and wind-dispersed pollen is released for several weeks in the spring.\n\n[[Image:Pseudotsuga glauca cones.jpg|right|thumb|thumb|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir cones<br/>Left: [[Shuswap Lake]], [[British Columbia]], Canada<br/>Right: [[Chiricahua Mountains]], [[Arizona]], U.S.]]\n\nThe mature female [[Conifer cone|seed cones]] are pendent, 4\u20137&nbsp;cm long, 2&nbsp;cm broad when closed, opening to 3\u20134&nbsp;cm broad. They are produced in spring, purple (sometimes green) at first, maturing orange-brown in the autumn 5\u20137 months later. The seeds are 5\u20136&nbsp;mm long and 3\u20134&nbsp;mm broad, with a 12\u201315&nbsp;mm wing. Both coast Douglas-fir and Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir produce abundant crops of seed approximately every 2\u201311&nbsp;years. Seed is produced annually except for about 1 year in any 4-to-5-year period.\n\n==Growth==\n[[File:Pseudotsuga menziesii Thompson-Nicola BC.jpg|thumb|right|Douglas-fir, British Columbia]]\n\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir grows more slowly than coast Douglas-fir and is also much more cold tolerant.

The most prominent lateral roots begin in the 1st or 2nd year of growth. Most roots in surface soil are \"long ropelike laterals of secondary and tertiary origin\". Fine-root production is episodic in response to changing environmental conditions; the average lifespan of fine roots is usually between several days and several weeks.\n\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir reaches reproductive maturity at 12\u201315 years. It has winged seeds that are dispersed primarily by wind and [[gravity]]. In western [[Montana]] clearcuts, seeds were dispersed up to {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} uphill from their source, but seedfall between {{convert|180|\u2013|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} was only 7% of that found in uncut stands. Other studies determined that seedfall in [[clearcutting|clearcuts]] beyond {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on}} from seed trees was about 3% of seedfall in uncut stands where seed trees are close together. Well-stocked stands have resulted from seedfall from sources {{convert|1|\u2013|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} distant, but most Douglas-fir seeds fall within {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of their source. Small amounts of seed are dispersed by mice, [[chipmunk]]s, and [[squirrel]]s. Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir seeds are disseminated about twice as far as seeds of [[ponderosa pine]].\n\n==Longevity==\nThe oldest accurately-dated Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, 1275 years old, is in [[New Mexico]]. This longevity is apparently uncommon; growing on a relatively barren lava field has protected it from fire, animals, and humans. Growth typically slows dramatically between 90 and 140 years of age.\n\nIn the dry-belt forests of central [[British Columbia]], ages can exceed 500 years on sites normal for the region. The oldest accurately-dated growth ring available for the region is 1475; dates in the 1500s and 1600s are more common for remnant patches that have escaped logging, fire, and other disturbances.\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:USA 10638 Bryce Canyon Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine, [[Bryce Canyon National Park]], Utah]]\n\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir grows on a variety of sites across its wide geographic range. It grows at lower elevations adjacent to and within [[bunchgrass]] communities and is also found in upper-elevation subalpine forests. It tends to be most abundant in low- and middle-elevation forests, where it grows over a wide range of aspects, slopes, landforms, and soils.\n\nIn spring and winter (in British Columbia, Idaho, and Montana) [[elk]] browse on south- and southwest-facing Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine stands, particularly when shrubs and/or grasses are productive. In summer, elk generally are found at higher elevations (outside the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir and Pacific ponderosa pine zones). During fall, elk use stands of Rocky Mountain [[lodgepole pine]], [[subalpine fir]], [[western larch]], or [[grand fir]] with high canopy cover.\n\nIn parts of [[Yellowstone National Park]], elk browsing is so intensive that young Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir are stunted at {{convert|1|\u2013|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height, with live branches trailing very close to the ground, and branches on the upper two thirds of the tree dead. Low-elevation and south-facing open-structure Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir types are often important winter range for [[white-tailed deer]] and [[mule deer]]. [[Moose]] winter in low-elevation Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir types in areas where willow thickets, the preferred winter habitat, are lacking; in such areas Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir is an important moose food.\n\n[[Chipmunk]]s, [[mouse|mice]], [[vole]]s, and [[shrew]]s eat large quantities of conifer seeds from the forest floor, and clipped cones are a staple and major part of storage of red squirrels. These animals store a large amount of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir cones or seeds. [[American marten]] commonly den in hollow logs.\n\nNumerous species of [[songbird]]s extract seeds from Douglas-fir cones or forage for seeds on the ground. The most common are the [[Clark's nutcracker]], [[black-capped chickadee]], [[mountain chickadee]], [[boreal chickadee]], [[red-breasted nuthatch]], [[pygmy nuthatch]], [[red crossbill]], [[Two-barred crossbill|white-winged crossbill]], [[dark-eyed junco]], and [[pine siskin]]. Migrating flocks of dark-eyed juncos may consume vast quantities of seeds and freshly germinated seedlings. [[Woodpecker]]s commonly feed in the bark of Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir. [[Blue grouse]] forage on needles and buds in winter; they and other birds rely heavily on Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir communities for cover.\n\nThe Douglas-fir is vulnerable to infestation by a [[Eriosomatidae|woolly]] [[aphid]], ''[[Gall Adelgid|Adelges cooleyi]]'' that also infects the [[Engelmann spruce]] to complete its [[Gall Adelgid#Life cycle|lifecycle]].\n\n==Uses==\nRocky Mountain Douglas-fir is a valuable timber tree. The wood is exceptionally strong and is used for structural timber as well as poles, [[plywood]], pulp, dimensional [[lumber]], railroad ties, mine timbers, log cabins, posts and poles, fencing, and firewood. Other uses listed include \"machine-stress-rated lumber\", glued-laminated (Glulam) beams, pallets, furniture, cabinets, doors, flooring, window frames, and other miscellaneous woodwork and [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]]. Rocky Mountain Douglas-firs are also cut and sold as Christmas trees.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Commons|Pseudotsuga_menziesii#Pseudotsuga_menziesii_var._glauca|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=PSMEG USDA Plant Profile: ''Pseudotsuga menziesii'' var.

In [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] its range is continuous from the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] crest west to the [[Pacific Coast Ranges]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]. In California, it is found in the [[Klamath Mountains|Klamath]] and [[California Coast Ranges]] as far south as the [[Santa Lucia Mountains]] with a small stand as far south as the [[Purisima Hills]], [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara County]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=A New Douglas-Fir Locality in Southern California |author=James R.

On mature trees, it is thick and corky. The shoots are brown to olive-green, turning gray-brown with age, smooth, though not as smooth as [[fir]] shoots, and finely pubescent with short dark hairs. The [[bud]]s are a very distinctive narrow conic shape, {{convert|4|\u2013|8|mm|abbr=on}} long, with red-brown bud scales. The [[leaf|leaves]] are spirally arranged but slightly twisted at the base to lie in flattish either side of the shoot, needle-like, {{convert|2|-|3.5|cm|abbr=on}} long, green above with no [[stomata]], and with two whitish stomatal bands below. Unlike the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, coast Douglas-fir foliage has a noticeable sweet fruity-resinous scent, particularly if crushed.<ref name=FEIS>{{USFS|source={{cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/psemenm/all.html#BOTANICAL%20AND%20ECOLOGICAL%20CHARACTERISTICS|title=Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii|work=Fire Effects Information System|last=Uchytil|first=Ronald J.|year=1991}}}}</ref>\n\nThe mature female [[Conifer cone|seed cones]] are pendent, {{convert|5|-|8|cm|in}} long, {{convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|abbr=on}} broad when closed, opening to {{convert|4|cm|abbr=on}} broad. They are produced in spring, green at first, maturing orange-brown in the autumn 6\u20137 months later. The [[seed]]s are {{convert|5|\u2013|6|mm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|\u2013|4|mm|abbr=on}} broad, with a {{convert|12|\u2013|15|mm|abbr=on}} wing. The male ([[pollen]]) cones are {{convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|abbr=on}} long, dispersing yellow pollen in spring.<ref name=FEIS/>\n\nIn [[forest]] conditions, old individuals typically have a narrow, cylindric crown beginning {{convert|20|-|40|m|ft}} above a branch-free trunk. Self-pruning is generally slow and trees retain their lower limbs for a long period. Young, open-grown trees typically have branches down to near ground level. It often takes 70\u201380 years for the trunk to be clear to a height of {{convert|5|m|ft}} and 100 years to be clear to a height of {{convert|10|m|ft}}.<ref name=FEIS/>\n\nAppreciable seed production begins at 20\u201330 years in open-grown coast Douglas-fir. Seed production is irregular; over a 5-7 year period, stands usually produce one heavy crop, a few light or medium crops, and one crop failure. Even during heavy seed crop years, only about 25 percent of trees in closed stands produce an appreciable number of cones. Each cone contains around 25 to 50 seeds. Seed size varies; average number of cleaned seeds varies from 70-88/g (32,000-40,000 per pound). Seeds from the northern portion of coast Douglas-fir's range tend to be larger than seed from the south.\n\n==Ecology==\n[[Image:Pseudotsuga menziesii 01221.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[snag (ecology)|snag]] provides nest cavities for birds]]\nThe [[root]]ing habit of coast Douglas-fir is not particularly deep, with the roots tending to be shallower than those of same-aged Ponderosa pine, sugar pine, or California incense-cedar, though deeper than Sitka spruce. Some roots are commonly found in organic soil layers or near the mineral soil surface. However, Douglas-fir exhibits considerable morphological plasticity, and on drier sites coast Douglas-fir will generate deeper taproots.<ref name=FEIS/>\n\nDouglas-fir [[snag (ecology)|snag]]s are abundant in forests older than 100\u2013150 years and provide cavity-nesting habitat for numerous forest birds.<ref name=FEIS/> Mature or \"old-growth\" Douglas-fir forest is the primary habitat of the [[red tree vole]] (''Arborimus longicaudus'') and the [[spotted owl]] (''Strix occidentalis''). Home range requirements for breeding pairs of spotted owls are at least 400 ha ({{convert|4|km2|acre}} of old-growth. Red tree voles may also be found in immature forests if Douglas-fir is a significant component. This animal nests almost exclusively in the foliage of Douglas-fir trees. Nests are located {{convert|2|-|50|m|ft}} above the ground. The red tree vole's diet consists chiefly of common{{Verify source|date=April 2010}}<!-- was \"Coastal\", but does the vole only occur along the coast? The text's use of the nondescript \"foliage of Douglas-fir trees\" does not suggest so. --> Douglas-fir needles. A [[parasitic plant]] sometimes utilizing ''P. menziesii'' is [[Arceuthobium douglasii]] Commonly known as Douglas-fir dwarf mistletoe.\n\nIts seedlings are not a preferred browse of [[black-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus columbianus'') and [[elk]] (''Cervus canadensis''), but can be an important food source for these animals during the winter when other preferred forages are lacking. In many areas, coast Douglas-fir needles are a staple in the spring diet of [[blue grouse]] (''Dendragapus''). In the winter, [[New World porcupine]]s primarily eat the inner bark of young conifers, among which they prefer Douglas-fir.<ref name=FEIS/>\n\nDouglas-fir seeds are an extremely important food for small mammals. Mice, voles, shrews, and chipmunks consumed an estimated 65 percent of a Douglas-fir seed crop following dispersal in western Oregon. The [[Douglas squirrel]] (''Tamiasciurus douglasii'') harvests and caches great quantities of Douglas-fir cones for later use. They also eat mature pollen cones, developing inner bark, terminal shoots, and tender young needles. The seeds are also important in the diets of several seed-eating birds. These include most importantly [[American sparrows]] (Emberizidae) &ndash; [[dark-eyed junco]] (''Junco hyemalis''), [[song sparrow]] (''Melospiza melodia''), [[golden-crowned sparrow]] (''Zonotrichia atricapilla'') and [[white-crowned sparrow]] (''Z. leucophrys'') &ndash; and [[true finch]]es (Fringillidae) &ndash; [[pine siskin]] (''Carduelis pinus''), [[purple finch]] (''\"Carpodacus\" purpureus''), and the Douglas-fir [[red crossbill]] (''Loxia curvirostra neogaea'') which is uniquely adapted to foraging for ''P. menziesii'' seeds.<ref name=FEIS/>\n\nThe coast Douglas-fir variety is the dominant tree west of the Cascade Mountains in the [[Pacific Northwest]], occurring in nearly all forest types, competes well on most parent materials, aspects, and slopes. Adapted to a moist, mild climate, it grows larger and faster than [[Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir]]. Associated trees include [[western hemlock]], [[Sitka spruce]], [[sugar pine]], [[western white pine]], [[Ponderosa pine]], [[grand fir]], [[coast redwood]], [[western redcedar]], [[Incense-cedar|California incense-cedar]], [[Chamaecyparis lawsoniana|Lawson's cypress]], [[tanoak]], [[bigleaf maple]] and several others. Pure stands are also common, particularly north of the [[Umpqua River]] in Oregon.\n\n[[Shrub]] associates in the central and northern part of Coast Douglas-fir's range include [[vine maple]] (''Acer circinatum''), [[salal]] (''Gaultheria shallon''), Pacific [[rhododendron]] (''Rhododendron macrophyllum''), [[Oregon-grape]] (''Mahonia aquifolium''), [[red huckleberry]] (''Vaccinium parvifolium''), and [[salmonberry]] (''Rubus spectabilis''). In the drier, southern portion of its range shrub associates include [[Beaked Hazel|California hazel]] (''Corylus cornuta'' var. ''californica''), [[oceanspray]] (''Holodiscus discolor''), [[Snowberry|creeping snowberry]] (''Symphoricarpos mollis''), western poison-oak (''[[Toxicodendron diversilobum]]''), [[ceanothus]] (''Ceanothus'' spp.), and [[manzanita]] (''Arctospaphylos'' spp.). In wet coastal forests, nearly every surface of old-growth coast Douglas-fir is covered by [[epiphyte|epiphytic]] [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s.\n\n==Forest succession==\n[[File:Red Creek Fir.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Red Creek Fir, ca.15 km from [[Port Renfrew]], BC, measures 43.7ft around its base and stretches 242 ft high]]\nThe shade-intolerance of Douglas-fir plays a large role in the forest [[Ecological succession|succession]] of lowland old growth rainforest communities of the Pacific Northwest. While mature stands of lowland old-growth rainforest contain many western hemlock (''Tsuga heterophylla'') seedlings, and some [[western redcedar]] (''Thuja plicata'') seedlings, Douglas-fir dominated stands contain almost no Douglas-fir seedlings. This seeming contradiction occurs because Douglas-firs are intolerant of deep shade and rarely survive for long within the shaded understory. When a tree dies in a mature [[forest]] the canopy opens up and sunlight becomes available as a source of energy for new growth. The shade-tolerant Western Hemlock seedlings that sprout beneath the canopy have a head-start on other seedlings. This competitive advantage allows the [[western hemlock]] to grow rapidly into the sunlight, while other [[seedling]]s still struggle to emerge from the soil. The boughs of the growing western hemlock limit the sunlight for smaller trees and severely limit the chances of shade-intolerant trees, such as the Douglas-fir. Over the course of centuries, western hemlock typically come to dominate the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] of an old-growth lowland rainforest.\n\nDouglas-firs are seral trees in temperate rainforest, and possess thicker bark and a somewhat faster growth rate than most other climax trees of the area, such as the western hemlock and western redcedar. This quality often gives Douglas-firs a competitive advantage when the forest experiences a major disturbance such as fire. Periodically, portions of a [[Pacific Northwest]] lowland forest may be burned by wildfire, may be logged, or may be blown down by a wind-storm. These types of disturbances allow Douglas-fir to regenerate in openings, and low-intensity fires often leave Douglas-fir trees standing on drier sites, while less drought- and fire-tolerant species are unable to get established.\n\n[[Conifer]]s dominate the climax forests of the coast Douglas-fir. All of the climax conifers that grow alongside Douglas-fir can live for centuries, with a few species capable of living for over a millennium. Forests that exist on this time scale experience the type of sporadic disturbances that allow mature stands of Douglas-fir to establish themselves as a persistent element within a mature old-growth [[forest]]. When [[old growth forest]]s survive in a natural state, they often look like a patchwork quilt of different forest communities. Western hemlock typically dominate oldgrowth rainforests, but contain sections of Douglas-firs, redcedar, [[alder]], and even [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] forests on their southern extent, near the Oregon and California border, while [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]] increases in frequency with latitude.\n\nThe logging practices of the last 200 years created artificial disturbances that caused Douglas-firs to thrive. The Douglas-fir's useful wood and its quick growth make it the crop of choice for many timber companies, which typically replant a clear-cut area with Douglas-fir seedlings. The high-light conditions that exist within a clear-cut also naturally favor the regeneration of Douglas-fir. Because of clear-cut logging, almost all the Pacific Northwest forests not strictly set aside for protection are today dominated by Douglas-fir, while the normally dominant climax species, such as western hemlock and western redcedar are less common. On drier sites in California, where Douglas-fir behaves as a climax species in the absence of fire, the Douglas-fir has become somewhat invasive following fire suppression practices of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries; it is becoming a dominant species in many [[oak]] [[California oak woodland|woodlands]], in which it was previously a minor component.<ref>C.

The wood is used for dimensional lumber, timbers, pilings, and [[plywood]]. [[Creosote]] treated pilings and decking are used in marine structures. The wood is also made into railroad ties, mine timbers, house logs, posts and poles, flooring, pulp, and furniture. Coast Douglas-fir is used extensively in landscaping.

The plant has thick fleshy roots, flourishes in rich, rather moist soil.  In the [[Mississippi embayment]] (Mississippi River Valley) it is found most frequently on rocky slopes as part of the undergrowth. Its juices are acrid and bitter and the bark possesses tonic properties.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nThe [[twig]]s are slender to moderately stout, brown with deep U-shaped leaf scars, and with short, light brown, fuzzy buds. The [[Leaf|leaves]] are alternate, 5\u201318&nbsp;cm long, palmately compound with three (rarely five) leaflets, each leaflet 1\u201310&nbsp;cm long, sparsely serrated or entire, shiny dark green above, paler below. The western and southwestern forms have smaller leaves (5\u201311&nbsp;cm) than the eastern forms (10\u201318&nbsp;cm), an adaptation to the drier [[climate]]s there.\n\nThe [[flower]]s are small, 1\u20132&nbsp;cm across, with 4-5 narrow, greenish white petals, produced in terminal, branched clusters in spring: some find the odor unpleasant but to others trifoliata has a delicious scent. The [[fruit]] is a round wafer-like papery [[Samara (fruit)|samara]], 2-2.5&nbsp;cm across, light brown, maturing in summer.  Seed vessel has a thin wing and is held on tree until high winds during early winter.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nThe [[bark]] is reddish brown to gray brown, short horizontal [[lenticel]]s, warty corky ridges, becoming slightly scaly, [[unpleasant odor]] and bitter taste. It has several [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] uses as a seasoning and as an [[herbalism|herbal medicine]] for different ailments.<ref>[http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Ptelea+trifoliata University of Michigan - Dearborn: Native American Ethnobotany, species account.] . accessed 8.24.2011</ref>\n\n* Bark: Dark reddish brown, smooth.  Branchlets dark reddish brown, shining, covered with small excrescences.  Bitter and ill-scented.\n* Wood: Yellow brown; heavy, hard, close-grained, satiny.  Sp. gr., 0.8319; weight of cu. ft., 51.84&nbsp;lbs.\n* Winter buds: Small, depressed, round, pale, covered with silvery hairs.\n* Leaves: Alternate, compound, three-parted, dotted with oil glands.  Leaflets sessile, ovate or oblong, three to five inches long, by two to three broad, pointed at base, entire or serrate, gradially pointed at apex.  Feather-veined, midrib and primary veins prominent.  They come out of the bud conduplicate, very downy, when full grown are dark green, shining above, paler green beneath.  In autumn they turn a rusty yellow.  Petioles stout, two and a half to three inches long, base enlarged.  Stipules wanting.\n* Flowers: May, June.  [[Polygamomonoecious]], greenish white.

They gave it the name \"Sacred Bark\" (''c\u00e1scara sagrada'') in honor of its effectiveness. By 1877 the U.S. pharmaceutical company [[Parke-Davis]] was producing cascara preparations, and soon afterwards cascara products were being exported overseas to European markets. The explosion of the cascara industry caused great damage to native cascara populations during the 1900s, as a result of overharvesting.<ref name=\"Johnson-2008-p77\" />\n\nIn 1999, cascara made up more than 20% of the national laxative market in the U.S., with an estimated value of $400&nbsp;million.

Molecular studies have shown the three to be each other's closest relatives, generally with the redwood and giant sequoia (''[[Sequoiadendron giganteum]]'') as each other's closest relatives. However, Yang and colleagues in 2010 queried the polyploid state of the redwood and speculate that it may have arisen as an ancient hybrid between ancestors of the giant sequoia and dawn redwood (''[[Metasequoia]]''). Using two different single copy [[nuclear gene]]s, [[Leafy|LFY]] and [[NLY]], to generate [[phylogenetic tree]]s, they found that ''Sequoia'' was clustered with ''Metasequoia'' in the tree generated using the LFY gene, but with ''Sequoiadendron ''in the tree generated with the NLY gene. Further analysis strongly supported the hypothesis that ''Sequoia'' was the result of a [[hybridization event]] involving ''Metasequoia'' and ''Sequoiadendron''. Thus, Yang and colleagues hypothesize that the inconsistent relationships among ''Metasequoia'', ''Sequoia,'' and ''Sequoiadendron'' could be a sign of [[reticulate evolution]] (in which two species hybridize and give rise to a third) among the three genera. However, the long evolutionary history of the three genera (the earliest fossil remains being from the [[Jurassic]]) make resolving the specifics of when and how ''Sequoia'' originated once and for all a difficult matter\u2014especially since it in part depends on an incomplete fossil record.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|title = Three Genome-based Phylogeny of Cupressaceae s.l: Further Evidence for the Evolution of Gymnosperms and Southern Hemisphere Biogeography|year = 2012|last = Yang|first = Z.Y.|last2 = Ran|first2 = J.H.|last3 = Wang|first3 = X.Q.|journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution|volume = 64|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2012.05.004|pages=452\u2013470|pmid=22609823}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Coast redwood bark.jpg|thumb|left|Bark detail]]\n\nThe coast redwood can reach {{convert|115|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall with a trunk diameter of {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Flora of North America\">{{cite web|url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=200005399|title=Sequoia sempervirens (D.

Cool coastal air and [[fog drip]] keep this forest consistently damp year round. Several factors, including the heavy rainfall, create a soil with fewer nutrients than the trees need, causing them to depend heavily on the entire biotic community of the forest, especially complete recycling of the trees when dead. This forest community includes [[coast Douglas fir]], [[Pacific madrone]], [[tanoak]], [[western hemlock]], and other trees, along with a wide variety of [[fern]]s, [[moss]]es, [[fungus|mushrooms]], and [[redwood sorrel]]. Redwood forests provide habitat for a variety of amphibians, bird, mammals, and reptiles. [[Old-growth]] redwood stands provide habitat for the federally threatened [[spotted owl]] and the California-endangered [[marbled murrelet]].\n\nCoast redwoods are resistant to insect attack, fungal infection, and rot.

Coast redwoods produce many cones, with redwoods in new forests producing thousands per year.<ref name=\":2\" /> The cones themselves hold 90\u2013150 seeds, but viability of seed are low, typically well below 15% with one estimate of average rates being 3 to 10 percent.<ref name=ucberkeley1>{{cite web|title=Botanical Garden Logistics|work=UC Berkeley \u2013 Biology 1B \u2013 Plants & Their Environments (p. 13)|publisher=Department of Integrative Biology, University of California-Berkeley|location=Berkeley, California|url=http://ib.berkeley.edu/courses/bio1b/labschedfall07/labexercises/PlantsEnvironments3_4_3.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513135321/http://ib.berkeley.edu/courses/bio1b/labschedfall07/labexercises/PlantsEnvironments3_4_3.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-13|accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref><ref name=\":2\" /> The low viability may discourage seed predators, which do not want to waste time sorting chaff (empty seeds) from edible seeds. Successful germination often requires a fire or flood, reducing competition for seedlings. The winged seeds are small and light, weighing 3.3\u20135.0&nbsp;mg (200\u2013300 seeds/g; 5,600\u20138,500/ounce). The wings are not effective for wide dispersal, and seeds are dispersed by wind an average of only {{convert|60|\u2013|120|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the parent tree. Seedlings are susceptible to fungal infection and predation by [[banana slug]]s, [[Brush rabbit|bush rabbits]], and [[nematode]]s.<ref name=\":03\" /> Most seedlings do not survive their first three years.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, those that become established grow very fast, with young trees known to reach {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall in 20 years.\n\nCoast redwoods can also reproduce asexually by layering or sprouting from the root crown, stump, or even fallen branches; if a tree falls over, it will regenerate a row of new trees along the trunk, so many trees naturally grow in a straight line. Sprouts originate from dormant or adventitious buds at or under the surface of the bark. The dormant sprouts are stimulated when the main adult stem gets damaged or starts to die. Many sprouts spontaneously erupt and develop around the circumference of the tree trunk. Within a short period after sprouting, each sprout will develop its own root system, with the dominant sprouts forming a ring of trees around the parent root crown or stump. This ring of trees is called a \"fairy ring\". Sprouts can achieve heights of {{convert|2.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} in a single growing season.\n\nRedwoods may also reproduce using [[burl]]s. A burl is a woody [[lignotuber]] that commonly appears on a redwood tree below the soil line, though usually within {{convert|3|m|ft|0}} in depth from the soil surface. Coast redwoods develop burls as seedlings from the axils of their [[cotyledon]], a trait that is extremely rare in conifers.<ref name=\":2\" /> When provoked by damage, dormant buds in the burls sprout new shoots and roots. Burls are also capable of sprouting into new trees when detached from the parent tree, though exactly how this happens is yet to be studied. Shoot clones commonly sprout from burls and are often turned into decorative hedges when found in suburbia.\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[File:Coast_Redwood_2015-06_103.jpg|thumb|left|An example of a [[bonsai]] redwood, from the Pacific\nBonsai Museum]]\n[[File:Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail 3.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail]] passing through a fallen California redwood tree]]\nCoast redwood is one of the most valuable [[timber]] species in the lumbering industry.

Shaughnessy, Chief Engineer of the [[San Francisco]] Fire Department wrote,\n:\"In the recent [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|great fire]] of San Francisco, that began April 18th, 1906, we succeeded in finally stopping it in nearly all directions where the unburned buildings were almost entirely of frame construction, and if the exterior finish of these buildings had not been of redwood lumber, I am satisfied that the area of the burned district would have been greatly extended.\"\n\nBecause of its impressive resistance to decay, redwood was extensively used for [[railroad ties]] and [[trestle]]s throughout California. Many of the old ties have been recycled for use in gardens as borders, steps, house beams, etc. Redwood burls are used in the production of table tops, veneers, and turned goods.\n\nThe [[Yurok]] people, who occupied the region before European settlement, carried out regular burnings of redwood forests to bolster [[Notholithocarpus|tanoak]] populations from which they harvested acorns, to maintain forest openings, and to boost populations of useful plant species such as those for medicine or basketmaking.<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/925183647|title=The Redwood Forest: History, Ecology, and Conservation of the Coast Redwoods|last=Noss|first=Reed|last2=|first2=|date=|publisher=Island Press|year=2000|isbn=1559637269|location=|pages=|oclc=925183647}}</ref>\n\nExtensive logging of redwoods began in the early nineteenth century.

Brigham Young University Press, Provo.</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe Pacific yew is a small to medium-sized evergreen [[tree]], growing 10\u201315&nbsp;m tall and with a trunk up to 50&nbsp;cm diameter, rarely more. In some instances, trees with heights in excess of 20&nbsp;m occur in parks and other protected areas, quite often in gullies. The tree is extremely slow growing, and has a habit of rotting from the inside, creating hollow forms. This makes it difficult and sometimes impossible to make accurate rings counts to determine a specimen's true age. Often damaged by succession of the forest, it usually ends up in a squat, multiple leader form.\n\nIt has thin scaly brown [[bark]], covering a thin layer of off-white sap wood with a darker heartwood that varies in color from brown to a magenta/purplish hue. The [[leaf|leaves]] are lanceolate, flat, dark green, 1\u20133&nbsp;cm long and 2\u20133&nbsp;mm broad, arranged spirally on the stem, but with the leaf bases twisted to align the leaves in two flat rows either side of the stem except on erect leading shoots where the spiral arrangement is more obvious.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|seed cones]] are highly modified, each cone containing a single [[seed]] 4\u20137&nbsp;mm long partly surrounded by a modified scale which develops into a soft, bright red [[Berry (botany)|berry]]-like structure called an [[aril]], 8\u201315&nbsp;mm long and wide and open at the end. The arils are mature 6\u20139 months after pollination. The seeds contained in the arils are eaten by [[Thrush (bird)|thrushes]] and other [[bird]]s, which disperse the hard seeds undamaged in their droppings; maturation of the arils is spread over 2\u20133 months, increasing the chances of successful seed dispersal. The male cones are globose, 3\u20136&nbsp;mm diameter, and shed their [[pollen]] in early spring. It is mostly [[Plant sexuality|dioecious]], but occasional individuals can be variably [[Plant sexuality|monoecious]], or change sex with time.\n\n==Habitat==\nPacific yew grows in varying types of environments; however, in drier environments it is mostly limited to stream side habitats, whereas in moist environments it will grow up onto slopes and ridgetops.<ref name = Bolsinger1965/> Pacific yew is [[Shade tolerance|shade tolerant]]; however it can also grow in sun.<ref name = Mitchell>{{cite journal|last = Mitchell| first = A. |title = Acclimation of Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia) foliage to sun and shade | journal = Tree Physiology | volume = 18| url = http://treephys.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/11/749.full.pdf+html}}</ref> The tree's shade tolerance allows it to form an [[understory]], which means that it can grow along streams providing shade to maintain water temperature.<ref>{{cite web| title = Pacific Yew: a Faculative Riparian Conifer with an Uncertain Future | last = Scher | first = Stanley | last2 = Schwarzschild | first2 = Bert | year = 1989 | url = http://gis.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr110/psw_gtr110_d_scher.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Varieties of Pacific yew (''Taxus brevifolia'')==\n\n'''''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''reptaneta'''''. Although ''T. brevifolia'' is typically a tree as described above, ''T. brevifolia'' var. ''reptaneta'' is a shrub variety that generally occurs in the mid to upper elevation range of the typical variety, 3,500 to 4,000&nbsp;ft (1000\u20131219 m) at its southernmost occurrence in the [[Klamath Mountains]] region, and at lower elevations further north.<ref name=\"Spjut2007b\">Spjut, R. W. 2007. Taxonomy and nomenclature of ''Taxus''.  J. Bot. Res. Inst. Texas 1(1): 203\u2013289.</ref>  It is distinguished from young trees of the typical variety (var. ''brevifolia'') by its stems initially creeping along the ground for a short distance before ascending (curving) upwards and by the branches growing off to one side of the stem, usually the upper side.<ref>Web page, World Botanical Associates, ''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''reptaneta''; http://www.worldbotanical.com/taxus_brevifolia_var_reptaneta.htm. Retrieved 9 Dec 2014</ref> The epithet ''reptaneta'' is from the Latin reptans which means \u201ccreeping, prostrate, and rooting,\u201d<ref>Stearn, W. T.  1983.  Botanical Latin.  3rd ed.  David & Charles, London</ref> which is exactly what this variety does; in rooting it forms yew thickets; hence, the epithet ''reptaneta'' (etum means collective place of growth) and hence the common name, thicket yew. Unlike the typical variety, thicket yew grows in abundance on open sunny avalanche shoots or ravines as well as in the forest understory.  It also occurs along forest margins. In northwestern Montana, a variant of the thicket yew does not ascend upwards; rather, it remains along the ground.<ref name=\"Spjut2007b\" />  This is probably the ancestral form; the upright form with branches along the upper side would be the expected growth pattern that might evolve from one with stems that strictly creep along the ground since branches can only arise from the upper surface.\n\n''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''reptaneta'' has been arbitrarily indicated synonymous with typical yew, ''T. brevifolia'' (var. ''brevifolia''); there are no studies to support this view.  Even though the two varieties may be genetically distinct, some botanists recognize species or varieties only if they have different geographically ranges. For example, ''T. mairei'' var. ''speciosa'', which occurs with the typical variety in southern China in 10 of 13 provinces, was rejected because \u201cthere is no geographic reason\u201d for recognizing it<ref>M\u00f6ller M, Gao L-M, Mill RR, Liu J, Zhang D-Q, Poudel RC, Li D-Z, 2013. A multidisciplinary approach reveals hidden taxonomic diversity in the morphologically challenging ''Taxus wallichiana'' complex. Taxon 62: 1161\u20131177.</ref> even though it appears genetically distinct.<ref>Gao L-M, M\u00f6ller M, Zhang X-M, Hollingsworth ML, Liu J, Mill RR, Gibby M, Li D-Z, 2007. High variation and strong phylogeographic pattern among cpDNA haplotypes in ''Taxus wallichiana'' (Taxaceae) in China and North Vietnam. Molec. Ecol. 16: 4684\u20134698.</ref>\n\n''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''reptaneta'' has also been proposed to be elevated to subspecies status without justification or explanation. Such a change would likely cause considerable confusion in view of the subspecies rank having already been used in the genus ''Taxus'' for defining geographically separated subspecies of a single species (''T. baccata'').<ref>Pilger R, 1903. Taxaceae-Taxoideae\u2014Taxeae. ''Taxus''. In: Das Pflanzenreich IV (Engler A. ed.): 110\u2013116.</ref>  Further, it has been recommended that taxonomists be strongly discouraged from \u201celevating a \u2018variety\u2019 to a \u2018subspecies\u2019 unless there is sufficient scientific evidence to warrant such an elevation,\u201d and that \u201cit is crucial to provide continuity.\u201d<ref>Ellison AM, Davis CC, Calie PJ, Naczi RFC, 2014. Pitcher plants (''Sarracenia'') provide a 21st-century perspective on infraspecific ranks and interspecific hybrids: A modest proposal for appropriate recognition and usage. Syst. Bot. 39: 939\u2013949.</ref>\n\n'''''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''polychaeta'''''.  Typical ''Taxus brevifolia'', like most species in the genus, usually produces a single ovule on a complex scaly shoot, composed of a primary shoot and a secondary short shoot. To the casual observer they appear as one funnelform shoot with an ovule at the apex.<ref>Florin R, 1951. Evolution in cordaites and conifers. Acta Horti Berg. 16: 285\u2013388, plate</ref>  However, ''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''polychaeta'' differs from var. ''brevifolia'' in producing a relatively longer primary shoot<ref name=\"Spjut2007b\" /> with as many five secondary shoots.<ref>Web page, World Botanical Associates, Overview of the genus ''Taxus'', http://www.worldbotanical.com/TAXNA.HTM, retrieved 9 Dec 2014</ref> The epithet, ''polychaeta'', is in reference to the primary shoot resembling a [[polychaete]] worm; hence, its common name \u201cworm cone yew.\u201d Variety ''polychaeta'' appears to be relatively rare. It may have been [[extirpated]] from the type locality\u2014around Mud Bay near Olympia, Washington\u2014as a result of urban expansion. It is also known from northern Idaho and Sonoma County, California.<ref name=\"Spjut2007b\" /><ref>Web page, World Botanical Associates, ''Taxus brevifolia'' var. ''polychaeta''; http://www.worldbotanical.com/taxus_brevifolia_var_polychaeta.htm; retrieved 9 Dec 2014</ref>\n\nAs in the case with thicket yew, worm yew has been indicated to be the same as the typical variety, but again there are no specific studies to support this conclusion.  The authority of thicket yew and worm cone yew has been involved in the study of the genus ''Taxus'' for 25 years at the time the varieties were described.<ref name=\"Spjut2007b\" /><ref>Spjut, R.

As it was already becoming scarce when its chemotherapeutic potential was realized, the Pacific yew was never commercially harvested from its habitat at a large scale; the widespread use of the paclitaxel (taxol) was enabled when a semi-synthetic pathway was developed from extracts of cultivated yews of other species. Unlicensed pharmaceutical production use of closely related wild yew species in India and China may be threatening some of those species.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = BGCI\n  | first = \n  | title = \u2018Miracle\u2019 Cures Face Extinction\n  | url=http://www.bgci.org/medicinal/2040\n  | accessdate = 2008-07-21 }}\n</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage: PacificYew_7684.jpg|Pacific Yew foliage underside\nImage: PacificYew_8544.jpg|Pacific Yew form\nImage: PacificYew_8538.jpg|Pacific Yew foliage\nImage:PacificYew_7790.jpg|Pacific Yew mat form\nImage: PacificYew_8566.jpg|Pacific Yew bark\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons-inline}}\n* {{IUCN2006|assessor=Conifer Specialist Group|year=1998|id=34041|title=Taxus brevifolia|downloaded=05 May 2006}}\n* Heiken, D.

Saplings that do not produce the chemical often rot at an early stage, causing some trees to grow with a somewhat hollow, rotten trunk.<ref name=\"stewart 22\"/>\n\nIt is also widely used throughout Europe and America for making [[beehive]] frames.\n\n== Role in indigenous societies ==\n[[File:Klallam people near canoe.jpg|thumb|right|[[Klallam]] people and canoe, ca. 1914]]\n\nWestern redcedar has an extensive history of use by [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|Native Americans]] of coastal Oregon to southeast Alaska. Some northwest coast tribes refer to themselves as \"people of the redcedar\" because of their extensive dependence on the tree for basic materials. The wood has been used for constructing housing and [[totem pole]]s, and crafted into many objects, including masks, utensils, boxes, boards, instruments, canoes, vessels, houses, and ceremonial objects. Roots and bark were used for baskets, bowls, ropes, clothing, blankets, and rings.<ref name=\"stewart 17 19\">Stewart, pp. 17\u201319</ref><ref>Van Pelt, p. 30</ref>\n\n===History===\nA huge number of archeological finds point to the continuous use of redcedar wood in native societies. Woodworking tools dating between 8000 and 5000 years ago, such as carved antlers, were discovered in [[shell midden]]s at the Glenrose site, near [[Vancouver]], British Columbia.<ref name=\"stewart 27\">Stewart, p. 27</ref> In [[Yuquot, British Columbia|Yuquot]], on the west coast of Vancouver Island, tools dating 4000 to 3000 years old have been found.<ref name=\"stewart 27\"/> The Musqueam site, also near Vancouver, yielded bark baskets woven in five different styles, along with ropes and ships dated to 3000 years ago. At [[Pitt River]], [[adze]]s and baskets were dated around 2900 years aol. Wooden artifacts 1000 years old were unearthed on the east coast of [[Vancouver Island]].<ref name=\"stewart 26\">Stewart, p. 26</ref>\n\nRed cedar was used extensively wherever it was found along the northwest coast ([[British Columbia]], [[Washington state]], Parts of [[Alaska]]). Evidence of this use is found in CMTs ([[Culturally Modified Trees]]) that are found throughout the coast. When First Nations people removed the bark from cedars, it left a scar - which is considered a CMT. Other types of harvest (for planks, tinder, and other uses) leave different types of evidence of cultural modification.\n\nA legend amongst the [[Coast Salish peoples]] describes the origins of the western redcedar. In this legend, there was a generous man who gave the people whatever they needed. When the [[Great Spirit]] saw this, he declared that when the generous man died, a great redcedar tree will grow where he is buried, and that the cedar will be useful to all the people, providing its roots for baskets, bark for clothing, and wood for shelter.<ref name=\"stewart 27\"/>\n\n=== Tools ===\nThe wood was worked primarily with the [[adze]], which was preferred over all other tools, even ones introduced by European settlers. Alexander Walker, an ensign on the fur trade ship ''Captain Cook'', reported that the indigenous peoples used an elbow adze, which they valued over new tools brought by the Europeans, such as the [[saw]] or the [[axe]], going so far as to modify traded tools back into an adze. Tools were generally made from stone, bone, [[obsidian]], or a harder wood such as [[Tsuga|hemlock]]. A variety of hand [[Post maul|maul]]s, wedges, chisels, and knives were used. Excavations done at [[Ozette, Washington]] turned up iron tools nearly 800 years old, far before European contact. When [[James Cook]] passed the area, he observed that almost all tools were made of iron.<ref name=\"stewart 36\">Stewart, p. 36</ref> There has been speculation on the origin of these iron tools. Some theories include shipwrecks from [[East Asia]] or possible contact with iron-using cultures from [[Siberia]], as hinted in the more advanced woodworking found in northern tribes such as the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]].<ref name=\"stewart 36\"/><ref>Pritzker, p. 292</ref><ref>Miller, p. 67</ref><ref>DeCapua, pp. 16\u201320</ref>\n\n=== Wood ===\n[[File:Moa-4.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A pole outside a six-post house at the [[University of British Columbia]]]]\nHarvesting redcedars required some ceremony and included propitiation of the tree's spirits as well as those of the surrounding trees. In particular, many people specifically requested the tree and its brethren not to fall or drop heavy branches on the harvester,<ref name=\"stewart 39\">Stewart, p. 39</ref> a situation which is mentioned in a number of different stories of people who were not sufficiently careful. Some professional loggers of Native American descent have mentioned that they offer quiet or silent propitiations to trees which they fell, following in this tradition.\n\nFelling of large trees such as redcedar before the introduction of steel tools was a complex and time-consuming art. Typically the bark was removed around the base of the tree above the buttresses. Then some amount of cutting and splitting with stone adzes and mauls would be done, creating a wide triangular cut. The area above and below the cut would be covered with a mixture of wet moss and clay as a firebreak. Then the cut would be packed with tinder and small kindling and slowly burned. The process of cutting and burning would alternate until the tree was mostly penetrated through, and then careful tending of the fire would fell the tree in the best direction for handling. This process could take many days. Constant rotation of workers was involved to keep the fires burning through night and day, often in a remote and forbidding location.<ref name=\"stewart 37 38\">Stewart, pp. 37\u201338</ref>\n\nOnce the tree was felled, the work had only just begun, as it then had to be stripped and dragged down to shore. If the tree was to become canoes, then it would often be divided into sections and worked into rough canoe shapes before transport. If it were to be used for a totem pole or building materials, it would be towed in the round to the village.<ref name=\"stewart 40\">Stewart, p. 40</ref> Many trees are still felled in this traditional manner for use as totem poles and canoes, particularly by artists who feel that using modern tools is detrimental to the traditional spirit of the art. Non-traditionalists simply buy redcedar logs or lumber at mills or lumber yards, a practice that is commonly followed by most working in smaller sizes such as for masks and staves.\n\nBecause felling required such an extraordinary amount of work, if only planks for housing were needed, these would be split from the living tree. The bark was stripped and saved, and two cuts were made at the ends of the planking. Then wedges would be pounded in along the sides and the planks slowly split off the side of the tree.<ref name=\"stewart 42\">Stewart, p. 42</ref> Trees which have been so harvested are still visible in some places in the rainforest, with obvious chunks taken off of their sides. Such trees usually continue to grow perfectly well, since redcedar wood is resistant to decay. Planks are straightened by a variety of methods, including weighing them down with stones, lashing them together with rope, or forcing them between a line of stakes.<ref name=\"stewart 43\">Stewart, p. 43</ref>\n\n[[File:Thuja plicata bark.png|thumb|upright|Illustration of women pulling bark from a tree, from ''Indian Legends of Vancouver Island'' by Alfred Carmichael]]\nRedcedar wood is used to make huge [[monoxyla]] [[canoe]]s in which the men went out to high sea to harpoon [[whale]]s and conduct trade.<ref>McNeese, p. 43</ref> One of those canoes, a {{convert|38|ft|m|adj=on}} craft dug out about a century ago, was bought in 1901 by Captain [[John Voss (sailor)|John Voss]], an adventurer. He gave her the name of [[Tilikum (boat)|Tilikum]] (\"Friend\" in Chinook jargon), rigged her, and led her in a hectic three-year voyage from British Columbia to [[London]].<ref>Dill, pp. 127\u2013128</ref>\n\nRedcedar branches are very flexible and have good tensile strength. They were stripped and used as strong cords for [[fishing]] line, rope cores, twine, and other purposes where bark cord was not strong enough or might fray. Both the branches and bark rope have been replaced by modern fiber and nylon cordage among the aboriginal northwest coast peoples, though the bark is still in use for the other purposes mentioned above.\n\n=== Bark ===\nAt the right time of year, the [[bark]] is easily removed from live trees in long strips. It is harvested for use in making mats, [[rope]] and cordage, [[basket]]ry, rain hats, [[clothing]], and other soft goods. The harvesting of bark must be done with care because, if the tree is completely stripped, it will die. To prevent this, the harvester usually only harvests from trees which have not been stripped before.<ref name=\"stewart 116\">Stewart, p. 116</ref> After harvesting the tree is not used for bark again, although it may later be felled for wood. Stripping bark is usually started with a series of cuts at the base of the tree above any buttresses, after which the bark is peeled upwards. To remove bark high up, a pair of platforms strung on rope around the tree are used and the harvester climbs by alternating between them for support. Since redcedars lose their lower branches as all tall trees do in the rainforest, the harvester may climb {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} or more into the tree by this method. The harvested bark is folded and carried in backpacks.<ref name=\"stewart 115\">Stewart, p. 115</ref> It can be stored for quite some time as mold does not grow on it, and is moistened before unfolding and working. It is then split lengthwise into the required width and woven or twisted into shape. Bark harvesting was mostly done by women, despite the danger of climbing 10 meters in the air, because they were the primary makers of bark goods.<ref name=\"stewart 113\">Stewart, p. 113</ref>\n\nToday bark rope making is a lost art in many communities, although it is still practiced for decoration or art in a few places. Other uses of bark are still common for artistic or practical purposes. In recent years there has been a revival of cedar weaving in some communities, and along with it, new forms of cedar bark products. For example, in some recent weddings cedar roses are used to decorate the tables.\n\n==Legal status==\nWestern red cedar is export-restricted in the United States under the [[Export Administration Regulations]].\n\n== Health and safety ==\nWestern red cedar is highly allergenic and woodworkers or [[loggers]] who work with it may have adverse reactions, including the development of [[occupational asthma]], exacerbation of existing [[asthma]], reduction of [[lung function]], and eye irritation. Approximately 5% of workers are allergic to western red cedar. The US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has set a [[permissible exposure limit]] for red cedar dust of 2.5&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> as a time-weighted average over 8 hours.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pel88/WOODDUST.html|title = Wood Dust|date = 28 September 2011|accessdate = |website = |publisher = OSHA/NIOSH}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n* [[Cedar wood]]\n* [[List of superlative trees]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|24em}}\n\n==Works cited==\n{{refbegin|32em}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bitner|first=Richard L.|title=Conifers for Gardens: an Illustrated Encyclopedia|year=2007|publisher=Timber Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=0-88192-830-5}}\n*{{cite journal |author=Chedgy, Russell J. |author2=Young Woon Lim |author3=Colette Breuil |last-author-amp=yes |year=2009 |title=Effects of leaching on fungal growth and decay of western redcedar (''Thuja plicata'') |journal=[[Canadian Journal of Microbiology]] |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=578\u2013586 |pmid=19483786 |doi=10.1139/W08-161}}\n*{{cite book|last=DeCapua|first=Sarah|title=The Tlingit|series=First Americans|location=Tarrytown, New York|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Benchmark|year=2010|isbn=0-7614-4135-2}}\n*{{cite book|last=Dill|first=J.

It is also an important [[timber]] tree throughout the region, along with many of its large coniferous associates.<ref name=packee>{{Silvics |last=Packee |first=E.C. |genus=Tsuga |species=heterophylla |volume=1}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nWestern hemlock is a large [[evergreen]] [[pinophyta|coniferous]] [[tree]] growing to {{convert|165|\u2013|230|ft|m|round=5|abbr=on}} tall, exceptionally {{convert|273.42|ft|m|abbr=on}},<ref name=mdv>Tallest Hemlock, M. D. Vaden, Arborist: [http://www.mdvaden.com/hemlock_tallest.shtml ''Tallest known Hemlock, Tsuga heterophylla'']</ref> and with a trunk diameter of up to {{convert|9|ft|m|abbr=on}}. It is the largest species of [[Tsuga|hemlock]], with the next largest ([[mountain hemlock]], ''T. mertensiana'') reaching a maximum of {{convert|194|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The [[bark]] is brown, thin and furrowed. The crown is a very neat broad conic shape in young trees with a strongly drooping lead shoot, becoming cylindric in older trees; old trees may have no branches in the lowest {{convert|100|\u2013|130|ft|m|round=5|abbr=on}}. At all ages, it is readily distinguished by the pendulous branchlet tips. The shoots are very pale buff-brown, almost white, with pale pubescence about {{convert|1|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, {{convert|5|\u2013|23|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2|mm|frac=64|abbr=on}} broad, strongly flattened in cross-section, with a finely [[serrate]]d margin and a bluntly acute apex. They are mid to dark green above; the underside has two distinctive white bands of [[stoma]]ta with only a narrow green midrib between the bands. They are arranged spirally on the shoots but are twisted at the base to lie in two ranks on either side of the shoot. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are small, pendulous, slender cylindrical, {{convert|14|\u2013|30|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|7|\u2013|8|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} broad when closed, opening to {{convert|18|\u2013|25|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} broad. They have 15\u201325 thin, flexible scales {{convert|7|\u2013|13|mm|frac=32|abbr=on}} long. The immature cones are green, maturing gray-brown 5\u20137 months after pollination. The [[seed]]s are brown, {{convert|2|\u2013|3|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long, with a slender, {{convert|7|\u2013|9|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long pale brown wing.<ref name=farjon /><ref name=gd />\n\n== Ecology ==\nWestern hemlock is closely associated with [[temperate rain forests]], and most of its range is less than {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. There is however an inland population in the [[Columbia Mountains]] in southeast [[British Columbia]], northern [[Idaho]] and western [[Montana]]. It mostly grows at low altitudes, from sea level to {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but up to {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the interior part of its range in Idaho.<ref name=farjon /><ref name=gd />\n\nIt is a very shade-tolerant tree; among associated species in the Pacific Northwest, it is matched or exceeded in shade tolerance only by [[Taxus brevifolia|Pacific yew]] and [[Abies amabilis|Pacific silver fir]].<ref name=packee />   Young plants typically grow up under the canopy of other conifers such as [[Sitka spruce]] or [[Douglas-fir]], where they can persist for decades waiting to exploit a gap in the canopy.  They eventually replace these conifers, which are relatively shade-intolerant, in climax forest. However, [[storm]]s and [[wildfire]]s will create larger openings in the forest where these other species can then regenerate.\n\nInitial growth is slow; one-year-old seedlings are commonly only {{convert|3|\u2013|5|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} tall, and two-year-old seedlings {{convert|10|\u2013|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} tall. Once established, saplings in full light may have an average growth rate of {{convert|50|\u2013|120|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} (rarely {{convert|140|cm|in|0|disp=comma|abbr=on}}) annually until they are {{convert|20|\u2013|30|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall, and in good conditions still {{convert|30|\u2013|40|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} annually when {{convert|40|\u2013|50|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall.  The tallest specimen, {{convert|82.83|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, is in [[Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park]], [[California]] (United States). It is long-lived, with trees over 1200 years old known.<ref name=gd />\n\nWestern hemlock forms [[ectomycorrhiza]]l associations with some well-known [[edible mushroom|edible fungi]] such as chanterelles (''[[Cantharellus formosus]]'', ''[[Cantharellus subalbidus|C. subalbidus]]'', and ''[[Craterellus tubaeformis]]'').<ref name=dun06 /><ref name=trappe04 />\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Tsuga heterophylla1.jpg|left|thumb|Young western hemlock]]\nWestern hemlock is the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].<ref>{{cite web |website=Washington State Government |url=http://www.leg.wa.gov/Legislature/StateSymbols/ |title=State Symbols}}</ref>\n\n=== Cultivation ===\nWestern hemlock is cultivated as an [[ornamental tree]] in gardens in its native habitats and along the U.S. Pacific Coast, where its best reliability is seen in wetter regions. In relatively dry areas, as at [[Victoria, British Columbia]], it is exacting about soil conditions. It needs a high level of organic matter (well-rotted wood from an old log or stump is best; animal manures may have too much [[nitrogen]] and [[salt]]), in a moist, acidic soil. It is also cultivated in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions worldwide.  It has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector \u2013 ''Tsuga heterophylla''|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1957|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Forestry ===\nWhen planted well upon the banks along a river, western hemlock can help to reduce erosion.\n\nOutside of its native range, western hemlock is of importance in [[forestry]] for timber and [[paper]] production, and as an [[ornamental tree]] in large [[garden]]s, in northwest Europe and southern New Zealand.\n\nIt has [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] in some parts of Great Britain and New Zealand, not so extensively as to be considered an [[invasive species]], but an [[introduced species]] tree.\n[[File:Tsuga heterophylla forest.jpg|thumb|right|''T. heterophylla'' often grows on [[coarse woody debris]] such as [[nurse log]]s and cut stumps]]\n\n=== Food ===\nThe edible [[Cork cambium|cambium]] can be collected by scraping slabs of removed bark. The resulting shavings can be eaten immediately, or can be dried and pressed into cakes for preservation. The bark also serves as a source of [[tannin]] for [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]].\n\nTender new growth needles (leaves) can be chewed directly or made into a bitter tea, rich in [[vitamin C]] (similar to some other hemlock and pine species).\n\nWestern hemlock boughs are used to collect [[herring]] eggs during the spring spawn in [[southeast Alaska]]. The boughs provide an easily collectible surface for the eggs to attach to as well as providing a distinctive taste. This practice originates from traditional gathering methods used by [[Alaska Natives|Native Alaskans]] from southeast Alaska, specifically the [[Tlingit people]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n\n* [[Tsuga canadensis]] the Eastern Hemlock\n\n== References ==\n{{commons+cat}}\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=trappe04>{{cite journal| journal=Mycologia|date=May\u2013Jun 2004| volume=96| issue=3| pages=498\u2013509| title=Habitat and host associations of ''Craterellus tubaeformis'' in northwestern Oregon| last=Trappe| first=MJ| pmid=21148873| url=http://www.mycologia.org/content/96/3/498.full| doi=10.2307/3762170}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=dun06>{{cite journal| title=Forest stand age and the occurrence of chanterelle (''Cantharellus'') species in Oregon\u2019s central Cascade Mountains| first=Susie M.| last=Dunham| first2=Thomas E.| last2=O'Dell| first3=Randy| last3=Molina| journal=Mycological Research| volume=110| year=2006| pages=1433\u201340| url=http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/bitstream/10113/13297/1/IND44024112.pdf| format=PDF| doi=10.1016/j.mycres.2006.09.007| pmid=17123812}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n[[Category:Pacific temperate rainforests ecoregion]]\n[[Category:Tsuga|heterophylla]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the West Coast of the United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Cascade Range]]\n[[Category:Trees of Alaska]]\n[[Category:Trees of British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of mild maritime climate]]\n[[Category:Least concern plants]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]\n[[Category:Trees of Subarctic America]]\n[[Category:Trees of Western Canada]]",

[[Arborescent]] individuals that have narrowly conical crowns until old age (300 to 400 years) and shrubby [[krummholz]] on cold, windy sites near timberline add beauty to mountain landscapes. Areas occupied by mountain hemlock generally have a cool to cold [[maritime climate]] that includes mild to cold winters, a short, warm-to-cool growing season and moderate to high precipitation.<ref name=silvics>{{Silvics |volume=1 |genus=Tsuga |species=mertensiana |first=Joseph E. |last=Means}}</ref>\n\nBest development of mountain hemlock is on loose, coarse-textured, well-drained soils with adequate moisture, and in [[British Columbia]], on thick and very acidic organic matter and decayed wood.<ref name=zone>{{cite book|last1=Brooke|first1=Robert C.|first2=E.

From southern British Columbia south, the tree grows better on northerly exposures. The preference for relatively moist, cool sites evidently becomes a necessity as the climate becomes more [[continental climate|continental]] in western Montana and more [[mediterranean climate|mediterranean]] in the central [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] at these extremes of its range.<ref name=Montana>{{cite journal|last=Habeck|first=James R.|year=1967|title=Mountain hemlock communities in western Montana|journal=Northwest Science|volume=41|issue=4|pages=169\u2013177}}</ref> In these locations, mountain hemlock typically grows in isolated populations in north-facing glens and [[cirque]] basins where snow collects and may remain well into summer.<ref name=silvics/>\n\nMountain hemlock is adapted to sites with long-lasting [[snowpack]]s. In the spring, mountain hemlocks emerging through {{convert|2|to|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} of snow were [[evapotranspiration|transpiring]], whereas nearby [[whitebark pine]]s did not transpire until the soil beneath them was free of snow.<ref name=silvics/> Mountain hemlock is well adapted to cope with heavy snow and ice loads, with tough branches and the drooping branchlets shedding snow readily.<ref name=gd/>\n\nMountain hemlock is tolerant of shade and other forms of competition.

J.|editor-last=Krajina|publisher=University of British Columbia, Department of Biology|location=Vancouver, BC}}</ref> Mountain hemlock is considered a minor climax species on most of its habitats; however, it pioneers on glacial moraines in British Columbia and Alaska. Pacific silver fir is a major climax species in many communities of the mountain hemlock forest in British Columbia and Washington and northern Oregon.<ref name=zone/><ref name=BC/> Alaska cedar, [[western redcedar]], and western hemlock are climax associates on some sites. Mountain hemlock is more commonly the major climax species in the mountain hemlock zone south of central Oregon where Pacific silver fir does not occur.<ref name=silvics/>\n\nMountain hemlock often succeeds [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole pine]] or [[subalpine fir]] when these species pioneer on drier sites. It also tends to replace [[Picea engelmannii|Engelmann spruce]] when the two species occur together, possibly because hemlock is better able to withstand the [[Allelopathy|allelopathic]] effects of spruce than are other associated species.<ref name=silvics/>\n\n==Cultivation==\nOutside of its native range, mountain hemlock is grown as an [[ornamental tree]]. It is planted as a specimen tree in [[native plant]] [[landscape]]s in [[California]], and particularly in [[garden]]s in northern [[Great Britain]] and [[Scandinavia]], where it is appreciated for its blue\u2013green color and tolerance of severe weather.

It is a member of the [[Pinus classification|white pine]] group, ''[[Pinus]]'' subgenus ''[[Strobus]]'', and like all members of that group, the leaves ('needles') are in [[Fascicle (botany)|fascicles]] (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. The needles are finely serrated, and {{convert|5|\u2013|13|cm|in}} long. The cones are long and slender, {{convert|12|\u2013|32|cm|in}} long and {{convert|3|\u2013|4|cm|in}} broad (closed), opening to {{convert|5|\u2013|8|cm|in}} broad; the scales are thin and flexible. The seeds are small, 4\u20137&nbsp;mm long, and have a long slender wing 15\u201322&nbsp;mm long.\n\nIt is related to the [[Eastern white pine]] (''Pinus strobus''), differing from it in having larger cones, slightly longer-lasting leaves (2\u20133 years, rather than 1.5\u20132 years) with more prominent [[stoma]]tal bands, and a somewhat denser and narrower habit. The branches are borne in regular whorls, produced at the rate of one a year; this is pronounced in narrow, stand-grown trees, while open specimens may have a more rounded form with wide-reaching limbs. It is widely grown as an [[ornamental tree]], but has been heavily logged throughout much of its range in the past.\n\n==Threats==\n[[File:Pinus monticola Umatilla.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Large ''P. monticola'']]\nWestern white pine  (''Pinus monticola'') has been seriously affected by the [[Cronartium ribicola|white pine blister rust]] (''Cronartium ribicola''), a fungus that was accidentally introduced from [[Europe]] in 1909. The [[United States Forest Service]] estimates that 90% of the Western white pines have been killed by the blister rust west of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]]. Large stands have been succeeded by other pines or non-pine species. The rust has also killed much of the [[Whitebark pine]] outside of [[California]]. Blister rust is less severe in California, and Western white and whitebark pines have survived there in great numbers.\n\nResistance to the blister rust is genetic, and due to Western white pine's genetic variability some individuals are relatively unaffected by the rust. The Forest Service has a program for locating and breeding rust-resistant Western white pine and [[sugar pine]].
