Enclosed between these mountains there are disperse groups of conifers in mid and high elevations valleys when rainfalls conditions allow its growth. Mexican conifers grow in some places associated with oaks.\n\nThe dry season is about 7\u20138 months. Most of rainfalls (80-95%) occur from June to October (5 months) and only four months in the north. Precipitations throughout the year are present only in a little portion of the Sierra Madre Oriental in the State of [[Veracruz]]. The greatest number of species belong the ''[[Pinus]]'' [[genus]], being about 60 the number of species and subspecies.\n\nAmong trees that grow in subtropical climates: [[Pinus chiapensis]], [[Pinus oocarpa]], [[pinus tecunumanii]]\n\nAmong the trees that grow in temperate and cool climates:\n\n[[Pinus ayacahuite]], [[Pinus cembroides]], [[Pinus durangensis]], [[Apache pine|Pinus engelmanii]], [[Pinus greggii]], [[Pinus hartwegii]], [[Pinus leiophylla]], [[Pinus lumholtzii]], [[Pinus devoniana]], [[Pinus montezumae]], [[Nelson's Pinyon|Pinus nelsonii]], [[Pinus oocarpa]] var. trifoliata, [[Pinus patula]], [[Pinus pseudostrobus]], [[Pinus hartwegii]], [[Pinus rudis]], [[Pinus teocote]], [[Taxodium mucronatum]], [[Abies religiosa]] and [[Cupressus lusitanica]].\n\nAmong trees that grow in exclusively in cool climates:\n[[Pinus hartwegii]], [[Pinus rudis]].\n\n== Cultivation and uses ==\n[[Image:Pinus devoniana 01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Pinus devoniana at [[Hackfalls Arboretum]], New Zealand]]\n\nSome of the trees are cut off locally for their wood which is used mainly in boards, construction, [[rustic furniture]] and in [[paper]] production. [[Resin]] is extracted from some species. And there are some trees that are estimated by its seeds: Pinus nelsonii, Pinus maximartinezii, Pinus cembroides and Pinus orizabenzis.\n\nThe conifers of Mexico have been recently started to be introduced in different parts around the world and their plantations are considered as very important. The leading reasons for that expansion is the good quality that their wood has for paper production but they are also planted as ornamental due to their unique characteristics and exotic beauty. The main genus used with that purposes are: pines, cypresses and firs and taxodiums.\n\nIn their natural environment they grow from 30\u00b0 to 14\u00b0 North Latitude. At altitudes between 600 to 4300 meters above sea level. And there are some advantages for their introduction in several places at different altitudes latitudes and climates: The average rainfalls in which they occur fluctuate between 380 to 2000 millimeters a year. Above 2400 m in elevation snowfalls are usual. Moist conditions vary from a short season of rainfalls in summer to a climate with rainfalls throughout the year, and can develop from semiarid to very wet conditions. In general they can withstand dry summers and some of are drought tolerant in several degrees. They grow from subtropical to cool climates; the average temperatures varies from 24&nbsp;\u00b0C to 10&nbsp;\u00b0C. Some of them are surprisingly hardy (Pinus hartweggi, Pinus rudis, Pinus ayacahuite; etc.) tolerating temperatures as low as \u201330&nbsp;\u00b0C. These trees occur as in very tilt slopes and plain valleys.\n\n'''Mexican conifers from temperate and cool climates that are being cultivated in other countries for paper industry according to altitudinal, latitudinal and climatic characteristis:\n\n''Near or in the [[Equator]] line at high altitudes'':\n\nPinus leiophylla in [[Kenya]].

The [[bark]] is dark brown to gray, with narrow fissures and flat ridges creating plate-like scales; it is thin and easily damaged. The [[leaf|leaves]] are opposite, simple, 6\u201312&nbsp;cm long and broad, with three to five deep, bluntly-pointed lobes, three of the lobes large and two small ones (not always present) at the leaf base; the three major lobes each have 3\u20135 small subsidiary lobules. The leaves turn golden yellow to red in fall (this trait is less reliable in warmer areas).\n\nThe [[flower]]s appear with the leaves in mid spring; they are produced in [[corymb]]s of 5\u201315 together, each flower yellow-green, about 4\u20135&nbsp;mm diameter, with no petals. The [[fruit]] is a paired samara (two winged [[seed]]s joined at the base), green to reddish-pink in color, maturing brown in early fall; each seed is globose, 7\u201310&nbsp;mm diameter, with a single wing 2\u20133&nbsp;cm long.\n\n[[Image:Red leaves (Acer grandidentatum) - Little Cottonwood Canyon, Utah (2003).jpg|left|180px]]\nIt commonly grows in [[limestone]] soils but can adapt to a wide range of well-drained soils, from sand to clays to even white limestone areas.

Although some other maples (such as ''[[Acer griseum]]'', ''[[Acer mandshuricum]]'' and the closely related [[Acer cissifolium|''A. cissifolium'']]) have [[leaf shape|trifoliate]] leaves, only ''A. negundo'' regularly displays more than three leaflets.\n\nThe leaflets are about {{convert|5|-|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}} long and {{convert|3|-|7|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} wide with slightly serrate margins.  Leaves have a [[translucence|translucent]] light green color and turn yellow in the [[Autumn|fall]].\n\nThe [[flower]]s are small and appear in early spring on drooping [[raceme]]s {{convert|10|-|20|cm|in|0|sp=us}} long.  The [[fruit]]s are paired [[Samara (fruit)|samaras]], each seed slender, {{convert|1|-|2|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long, with a {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} incurved wing; they drop in autumn or they may persist through winter.  Seeds are usually both prolific and [[fertility|fertile]].\n\nUnlike most other maples, ''A. negundo'' is fully [[dioecious]] and both a male and female tree are needed for either to reproduce.\n\n* Winter buds: Terminal buds acute, an eighth of an inch long.  Lateral buds obtuse.  The inner scales enlarge when spring growth begins and often become an inch long before they fall.\n* Flowers: April, before the leaves, yellow green; staminate flowers in clusters on slender hairy pedicels one and a half to two inches long.  Pistillate flowers in narrow drooping racemes.\n* Calyx: Yellow green; staminate flowers campanulate, five-lobed, hairy.  Pistillate flowers smaller, five-parted; disk rudimentary.\n* Corolla: Wanting.\n* Stamens: Four to six, exserted; filaments slender, hairy; anthers linear, connective pointed.\n* Pistil: Ovary hairy, borne on disk, partly enclosed by calyx, two-celled, wing-margined.  Styles separate at base into two stigmatic lobes.\n* Fruit: Maple keys, full size in early summer.  Borne in drooping racemes, pedicels one to two inches long.  Key an inch and a half to two inches long, nutlets diverging, wings straight or incurved.  September.  Seed half an inch long.  Cotyledons, thin, narrow.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\n=== Subspecies ===\n[[File:Acer negundo.jpg|thumb|right|''A. negundo'' leaves and fruits]]\n\n''Acer negundo'' is often discussed as comprising three subspecies, each of which was originally described as a separate species.  These are:\n\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''negundo'' is the main variety and the type to which characteristics described in the article most universally apply.  Its natural range is from the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] to the Rocky Mountains.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''interius'' has more leaf serration than the main species and a more [[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]] leaf surface.  As the name ''interus'' indicates, its natural range of [[Saskatchewan]] to [[New Mexico]] is sandwiched between that of the other two subspecies.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''californicum'' has larger leaves than the main species.  Leaves also have a velvety texture which is essential to distinguish it from ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''negundo''.  It is found in parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]].<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n\nSome authors further subdivide subsp. ''negundo'' into a number of regional varieties but these intergrade and their maintenance as distinct [[taxa]] is disputed by many.  Even the differences between recognized subspecies are probably a matter of gradient [[speciation]].\n\nFinally, note that a few botanists treat boxelder maple as its own distinct genus (''Negundo aceroides'') but this is not widely accepted.\n\n== Distribution ==\nAs noted, varieties thrive across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It may also be found as far south as [[Guatemala]].\n\nAlthough native to [[North America]], it is considered an [[invasive species]] in some areas of that continent. It can quickly [[colonize]] both cultivated and uncultivated areas and the range is therefore expanding both in North America and elsewhere. In Europe where it was introduced in 1688 as a park tree it is able to spread quickly in places and is considered an invasive species in parts of Central Europe (Germany and the Czech Republic, middle Danube, Vistula river valley in Poland) where it can form mass growth in lowlands, disturbed areas and riparian biomes on calcareous soils. It has also become [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] in eastern [[China]]<ref name=\"gelderen\" />  and can be found in some of the cooler areas of the [[Australian continent]] where it is listed as a pest [[invasive species]].\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Acer negundo tree.jpg|thumb|Boxelder, Manitoba Maple. Tree. ND, USA.]]\n\nThis species prefers bright sunlight. It often grows on flood plains and other disturbed areas with ample water supply, such as [[riparian]] habitats. Human influence has greatly favoured this species; it grows around houses and in hedges, as well as on disturbed ground and vacant lots.\n\nSeveral [[bird]]s and some [[squirrel]]s feed on the seeds.  The [[evening grosbeak]] uses them extensively. The [[Maple Bug]] (also known as the Boxelder Bug) lays its [[egg]]s on all maples, but prefers this species.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nAlthough its weak wood, irregular form, and prolific seeding might make it seem like a poor choice for a landscape tree, ''A. negundo'' is one of the most common maples in cultivation and many interesting [[cultivar]]s have been developed, including:<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* 'Auratum'&nbsp;\u2013 yellowish leaves with smooth undersides\n* 'Aureomarginatum'&nbsp;\u2013 creamy yellow leaf margins\n* 'Baron'&nbsp;\u2013 Hardier & seedless variety\n* 'Elegans'&nbsp;\u2013 distinctively convex leaves\n* 'Flamingo'&nbsp;\u2013 pink and white [[variegation]] (very popular)\n* [[Acer negundo 'Pendulum'|'Pendulum']]&nbsp;\u2013 with weeping branches.\n* 'Variegatum'&nbsp;\u2013 creamy white leaf margins\n* 'Violaceum'&nbsp;\u2013 younger shoots and branches have bluish colour\n\n== Uses ==\nAlthough its light, close-grained, soft wood is considered undesirable for most uses, this tree has been considered as a commercial source of wood fiber, for use in [[fiberboard]].\n\nThere is some commercial use of the tree for various decorative applications, such as turned items (bowls, stem-ware, pens). Primarily burl wood and injured wood, where the primary reason is this wood's reaction to injury, where the injured wood develops a red stain.\n\n=== Use by Native Americans ===\nThe [[Navajo people|Navajo]] use the wood to make tubes for bellows.<ref>Elmore, Francis H. 1944 Ethnobotany of the Navajo.

These early artifacts, excavated by Earl H. Morris in 1931 in the Prayer Rock district of present-day Northeastern Arizona, have been dated to 620\u2013670 CE.<ref name=\"brokenflutecave\">{{cite web |url=http://flutopedia.com/brokenflutecave.htm |title=Anasazi Flutes from the Broken Flute Cave |author=Clint Goss |year=2011 |access-date=2011-10-18}}</ref>\n\nThe style of these flutes, now known as [[Anasazi flute]]s, uses an open tube and a splitting edge at one end. This design pre-dates the earliest extant [[Native American flute]] (which use a two-chambered design) by approximately 1,200 years.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Philips, Roger.

The seeds and fruit of this plant can be dispersed during wet seasons where they fall into swamps and rivers. This allows the seeds and fruits to spread to coastlines. A 2008 study found that ''A. glabra'' seeds can withstand floating in salt water and fresh water for up to 12 months. About 38% of those seeds can then germinate in soil, though ''A. glabra'' roots do not do well with constant flooding.<ref name=\"Buoyancy\">{{cite journal |vauthors =Setter SD, et al |journal=Sixteenth Australian Weeds Conference|year=2008|title=Buoyancy and germination of pond apple (Annona glabra L.) propagules in fresh and salt water|pages=140\u2013142 |accessdate=2017-03-24}}</ref> Another study in 1998 found that even under intense flooding, the 12-month lifespan of ''A. glabra'' seedlings was unaffected; the growth rate of ''A. glabra'' trees did decrease however over a 6-month period.

The plan includes six steps that property owners can take to determine how to control and monitor an outbreak of ''A. glabra'' as well as how to minimize financial damage. To disincentivize the cultivation and spread of ''A. glabra'' by humans, its sale and entry is banned throughout most of Australia.<ref name=\"Control methods and Case Studies\"/> \n\nOptions for the control of the ''A. glabra'' include fire, chemical, and mechanical controls including combinations of the three types. The best time of year to do so according to the government of Australia is during the time between August to November, which is the dry season. There are currently no studies that have looked at the biological control of ''A. glabra'' within Australia. Without studies, any actions taken to eliminate the ''A. glabra'' with biological controls could inadvertently affect native Australian apple species that belong to the same family.<ref name=\"Control methods and Case Studies\"/> \n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Annona glabra}}\n{{wikispecies}}\n{{Grocers}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050717072546/http://www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/a-glabra.html Pond-apple as an invasive species in Australia]\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Annona|glabra]]\n[[Category:Tropical fruit]]\n[[Category:Invasive plant species]]\n[[Category:Flora of West Africa]]\n[[Category:Trees of Antigua and Barbuda]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Bahamas]]\n[[Category:Trees of Belize]]\n[[Category:Trees of Brazil]]\n[[Category:Trees of Colombia]]\n[[Category:Trees of Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Trees of Cuba]]\n[[Category:Trees of Dominica]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ecuador]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guadeloupe]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Trees of Hispaniola]]\n[[Category:Trees of Honduras]]\n[[Category:Trees of Jamaica]]\n[[Category:Trees of Martinique]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Flora of Nigeria]]\n[[Category:Trees of Panama]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Flora of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]\n[[Category:Flora of Sierra Leone]]\n[[Category:Trees of northern South America]]\n[[Category:Invasive plant species in Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]",

Glassman|Glassman]]</small>\n}}\n\n'''''Attalea''''' is a large [[genus]] of [[Arecaceae|palms]] native to [[Mexico]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. This [[pinnate]]ly leaved, non-spiny genus includes both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees. The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers. Since the genera can only be distinguished on the basis of their male flowers, the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus. This has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny.\n\nSomewhere between 29 and 67 species are recognised in the genus, with estimates of as many as 100. Incomplete [[herbarium]] collections make it difficult to determine whether certain groups represent single species, or groups of similar species. ''Attalea'' species have a long history of human use, and include economically important sources of [[palm oil]] and fibre. Many species are fire tolerant and thrive in disturbed habitats. Their seeds are animal dispersed, including some which are thought to have been adapted for dispersal by now-extinct [[Pleistocene megafauna]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Attalea maripa closeup.jpg|thumb|left|alt= A view of the crown of a palm tree from below.

In 1965, Dutch taxonomist [[Jan Gerard Wessels Boer]] estimated that there may be as many as 100 species in the genus. In their 1996 ''Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas'' Andrew Henderson and coauthors recognised 29 species in the genus, while Sidney Glassman recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group. Largely following Glassman's lead, Rafa\u00ebl Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised 67 species in their 2005 ''World Checklist of Palms''. An important element of this disagreement is the decision by Glassman to define species more narrowly than Henderson. As a result, what Henderson interpreted as variation within species, Glassman took as differences between [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] similar species. This problem is complicated by the fact that many of these species are poorly represented in [[herbarium]] collections. The large size of the leaves, inflorescences and fruit of many ''Attalea'' species makes them difficult to collect. In addition, many important collections, including [[type (biology)|type specimen]], have been lost or destroyed.<ref name = \"Pintaud2008\"/> Sparse or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species.<ref name = \"Pintaud2008\"/><ref name=\"Anderson1988\"/>\n\nThe three recent treatments (Henderson and coauthors, Glassman, and Govaerts and Dransfield) recognised a total of 73 species, but only 20 species are accepted by all of them. The remainder account for either nine species or more than 40. For example, what Andrew Henderson considered a single species, ''[[Attalea attaleoides]]'',<ref name = \"Henderson1995\">{{cite book|last=Henderson|first=Andrew|title=The palms of the Amazon|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-19-508311-8}}</ref> other authors have considered a [[species complex]] consisting of four or five species. Glassman doubted the validity of ''A.&nbsp;attaleoides'' as a species, and described four new species from material that had previously been attributed to ''A.&nbsp;attaleoides''\u2014''[[Attalea camopiensis|A.&nbsp;camopiensis]]'', ''[[Attalea degranvillei|A.&nbsp;degranvillei]]'', ''[[Attalea guianensis|A.&nbsp;guianensis]]'' and ''[[Attalea maripensis|A.&nbsp;maripensis]]''. Govaerts and Dransfield accepted both Glassman's four species and ''A.&nbsp;attaleoides''. However, Jean-Christophe Pintaud was of the opinion that ''A.&nbsp;guianensis'', ''A.&nbsp;maripensis'' and ''A.&nbsp;attaleoides'' were all very similar, and thought it likely that they all represented the same species.<ref name = \"Pintaud2008\"/>\n\nAnother species complex in ''Attalea'' includes ''[[Attalea speciosa|A.&nbsp;speciosa]]'' and related species. Henderson (1995) recognised ''A.&nbsp;speciosa'' and ''[[Attalea spectabilis|A.&nbsp;spectabilis]]'', considering the latter to either be an acaulescent form of ''A.&nbsp;speciosa'' or a hybrid between it and ''[[Attalea microcarpa|A.&nbsp;microcarpa]]''. Govaerts and Dransfield accepted ''A.&nbsp;spectabilis'', but Glassman considered it a [[Nomen dubium|dubious]] taxon. ''[[Attalea vitrivir]]'' was recognised as a distinct species by Michael Balick and coauthors;<ref>Balick ''et al.''. 1987, Anderson and Balick 1988</ref> Glassman and Govaerts and Dransfield concurred, but Henderson considered it part of ''A.&nbsp;speciosa''.

It is common throughout coastal areas of [[Texas]] and [[Florida]], and ranges as far north as southern [[Louisiana]] and coastal [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the [[United States]].\n\nLike many other [[mangrove]] species, it reproduces by [[vivipary]]. [[Seed]]s are encased in a [[fruit]], which reveals the [[Germination|germinated]] seedling when it falls into the water.\n\nUnlike other mangrove species, it does not grow on [[Aerial root#Aerial roots as supports|prop roots]], but possesses [[Aerial root#Pneumatophores|pneumatophores]] that allow its roots to breathe even when submerged. It is a hardy species and expels absorbed salt mainly from its leathery leaves.\n\nThe name \"black mangrove\" refers to the color of the trunk and [[Wood#Heartwood and sapwood|heartwood]]. The leaves often appear whitish from the [[salt]] [[Halophyte|excreted]] at night and on cloudy days. It is often found in its native range with the red mangrove (''[[Rhizophora mangle]]'') and the white mangrove (''[[Laguncularia racemosa]]''). White mangroves grow inland from black mangroves which themselves grow inland from red mangroves. The three species work together to stabilize the shoreline, provide buffers from [[storm surge]]s, trap debris and [[detritus]] brought in by [[tide]]s, and provide feeding, breeding, and nursery grounds for a great variety of [[fish]], [[shellfish]], [[bird]]s, and other wildlife.\n\n==Habitat==\n[[Image:Black mangrove-everglades natl park.jpg|left|thumb|A black mangrove tree growing in shallow water in [[Everglades National Park]]]]\n[[Image:Avicennia germinans-flowers2.jpg|left|thumb|Black mangrove flowers]]\nThe black mangrove grows just above the high [[tide]] in coastal [[lagoon]]s and [[brackish water]] [[Estuary|estuaries]]. It is less tolerant of highly saline conditions than certain other species that occur in mangrove ecosystems.<ref>World Wildlife Fund. 2010.

The [[seed]]s [[Germination|germinate]] in midsummer, but may be seen all year on the trees. The seeds can remain viable for over a year once released.\n\n==Wood==\nThe [[Wood#Heartwood and sapwood|heartwood]] is dark-brown to black, while the [[Wood#Heartwood and sapwood|sapwood]] is yellow-brown. It has the unusual property of having less dense heartwood than sapwood. The sapwood sinks in water while the heartwood floats. The wood is strong, heavy, and hard, but is difficult to work due to its interlocked grain and is somewhat difficult to finish due to its oily texture. Uses include posts, pilings, [[charcoal]], and [[Firewood|fuel]]. Despite growing in a marine environment, the dry wood is subject to attack by marine borers and [[termite]]s. Like many species, it contains [[tannin]] in the bark and has been used to [[Tanning (leather)|tan]] [[leather]] products.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*[[List of honey plants]]\n*[[:Category:Mangrove ecoregions|Mangrove ecoregions]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*  {{cite book\n | last = Haehle\n | first =  Robert\n | year = 1999\n | title = Native Florida Plants\n | publisher = Gulf Publishing Company\n | location = Houston\n | isbn = 0-88415-425-4\n}}\n* McKee, Karen L., Irving A.

High winds reduce the humidity, dehydrate the flowers, and affect pollination. When even a mild frost occurs, premature fruit drop may occur, although the '[[Hass avocado|Hass]]' [[cultivar]] can tolerate temperatures down to \u22121&nbsp;\u00b0C. The trees also need well-aerated soils, ideally more than 1 m deep. Yield is reduced when the irrigation water is highly [[salinity|saline]]. These soil and climate conditions are available in southern and eastern Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Crete, the Levant, South Africa, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, parts of central and northern Chile, Vietnam, Indonesia, parts of southern India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Central America, the Caribbean, Mexico, [[California]], [[Arizona]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Texas]], [[Florida]], [[Hawaii]], Ecuador, and Rwanda.

The avocado tree does not tolerate freezing temperatures, and can be grown only in subtropical or tropical climates. Several cold-hardy varieties are planted in the region of [[Gainesville, Florida]], which survive temperatures as low as {{convert|\u22126.5|C|0}} with only minor leaf damage.\n\nLike the [[banana]], the avocado is a [[climacteric (botany)|climacteric]] fruit, which matures on the tree, but ripens off the tree. Avocados used in commerce are picked hard and green and kept in coolers at {{convert|3.3|to|5.6|C|F}} until they reach their final destination. Avocados must be mature to ripen properly. Avocados that fall off the tree ripen on the ground. Generally, the fruit is picked once it reaches maturity; Mexican growers pick 'Hass' avocados when they have more than 23% dry matter, and other producing countries have similar standards. Once picked, avocados ripen in one to two weeks (depending on the cultivar) at [[room temperature]] (faster if stored with other fruits such as apples or bananas, because of the influence of [[ethylene]] gas). Some [[supermarkets]] sell ripened avocados which have been treated with synthetic ethylene to hasten ripening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Ethylene-Gas.htm |title=Ethylene gas and produce |publisher=Mindfully.org |date=1976-06-01 |accessdate=2010-05-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100526120225/http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Ethylene-Gas.htm| archivedate= 26 May 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The use of an ethylene gas \"ripening room\", which is now an industry standard, was pioneered in the 1980s by farmer Gil Henry of [[Escondido, California]], in response to footage from a hidden supermarket camera which showed shoppers repeatedly squeezing hard, unripe avocados, putting them \"back in the bin,\" and moving on without making a purchase.<ref>{{Cite news\n| author = Steve Chawkins\n| title = Gil Henry dies at 88; revolutionized avocado industry; Henry pioneered the use of a 'ripening room' at his family's Escondido farm.

This limitation, added to the long juvenile period, makes the species difficult to breed. Most cultivars are propagated by [[grafting]], having originated from random seedling plants or minor [[mutation]]s derived from cultivars. Modern breeding programs tend to use isolation plots where the chances of cross-[[pollination]] are reduced. That is the case for programs at the [[University of California, Riverside]], as well as the [[Agricultural research In Israel#Agricultural Research Organization (ARO)|Volcani Centre]] and the Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias in [[Chile]].\n\nThe avocado is unusual in that the timing of the male and female flower phases differs among cultivars. The two flowering types are A and B. A cultivar flowers open as female on the morning of the first day and close in late morning or early afternoon. Then they open as male in the afternoon of the second day. B varieties open as female on the afternoon of the first day, close in late afternoon and reopen as male the following morning.\n* A cultivars: 'Hass', 'Gwen', 'Lamb Hass', 'Pinkerton', 'Reed'\n* B cultivars: 'Fuerte', 'Sharwil', 'Zutano', 'Bacon', 'Ettinger', 'Sir Prize', 'Walter Hole'<ref>{{cite web|url = http://ceventura.ucdavis.edu/Agriculture265/Avocado_Handbook.htm|title = Agriculture Handbook|publisher = [[University of California]]|accessdate = 2007-12-29|year = 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071217095028/http://ceventura.ucdavis.edu/Agriculture265/Avocado_Handbook.htm| archivedate= 17 December 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/MG213|title = Avocado Growing in the Florida Home Landscape|publisher = [[University of Florida]]|first = JH|last = Crane|author2=Balerdi CF|author3=Maguire I|accessdate = 2007-12-29|date = 2007-08-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080113011328/http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/MG213| archivedate= 13 January 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nCertain cultivars, such as the 'Hass', have a tendency to bear well only in alternate years.

Prime quality varieties are therefore propagated by grafting to [[rootstock]]s that are propagated by seed (seedling rootstocks) or by [[layering]] (clonal rootstocks). After about a year of growing in a greenhouse, the young rootstocks are ready to be grafted. Terminal and lateral grafting is normally used. The scion cultivar grows for another 6\u201312 months before the tree is ready to be sold. Clonal rootstocks are selected for tolerance of specific soil and disease conditions, such as poor soil aeration or resistance to the soil-borne disease (root rot) caused by ''[[Phytophthora]]''.\n\n=== Growing indoors ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}\nIndoors, an avocado tree is usually grown from the [[Endocarp|pit]] of an avocado fruit. This is often done by removing the pit from a ripe, unrefrigerated avocado fruit. The pit is then stabbed with three or four toothpicks, about one-third of the way up from the flat end. The pit is placed in a jar or vase containing tepid water. It should split in four to six weeks and yield roots and a sprout. If there is no change by this time, the avocado pit is discarded. Once the stem has grown a few inches, it is placed in a pot with soil. It should be watered every few days. Avocados have been known to grow large, so owners must be ready to re-pot the plant several times.\n\n=== Diseases ===\n{{main article|List of avocado diseases}}\n[[File:Persea americana.jpg|thumb|''P. americana'', avocado plant flowers]]\n\nAvocado trees are vulnerable to [[bacteria]]l, [[virus|viral]], [[fungus|fungal]], and nutritional diseases (excesses and deficiencies of key minerals).

Prolonged cooking induces this chemical reaction in all cultivars.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bates|first1=Robert P.|title=HEAT-INDUCED OFF-FLAVOR IN AVOCADO FLESH|journal=Journal of Food Science|volume=35|pages=478\u2013482|year=1970|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.1970.tb00962.x|issue=4}}</ref>\n[[File:Guacomole.jpg|thumb|A [[guacamole]] mix (right) used as a dip for [[tortilla chip]]s (left).]]\nIt is used as the base for the Mexican dip known as [[guacamole]],<ref name=morton/> as well as a spread on [[corn tortillas]] or toast, served with spices.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]], Brazil, [[Indonesia]], [[Vietnam]], and southern India (especially the coastal [[Kerala]], Tamil Nadu and [[Karnataka]] region), avocados are frequently used for milkshakes and occasionally added to [[ice cream]] and other desserts.

[[Chocolate syrup]] is sometimes added. In [[Morocco]], a similar chilled avocado and milk drink is sweetened with [[confectioner's sugar]] and hinted with [[orange flower water]].\n\nIn [[Ethiopia]], avocados are made into juice by mixing them with sugar and milk or water, usually served with [[Vimto]] and a slice of lemon. It is also common to serve layered multiple fruit juices in a glass (locally called ''Spris'') made of avocados, mangoes, bananas, guavas, and papayas. Avocados are also used to make salads.\n\nAvocados in savory dishes, often seen as exotic, are a relative novelty in Portuguese-speaking countries, such as Brazil, where the traditional preparation is mashed with sugar and lime, and eaten as a dessert or snack. This contrasts with Spanish-speaking countries such as Chile, Mexico, or [[Argentina]], where the opposite is true and sweet preparations are rare.\n\n[[File:Sliced avocado.jpg|thumb|Sliced avocado]]\n\nIn Australia and New Zealand, it is commonly served in sandwiches, sushi, on toast, or with chicken. In [[Ghana]], it is often eaten alone in sliced bread as a sandwich. In [[Sri Lanka]], well-ripened flesh, thoroughly mashed with sugar and milk, or treacle (a syrup made from the nectar of a particular palm flower) is a popular dessert. In [[Haiti]], it is often consumed with [[cassava]] or regular bread for breakfast.\n\nIn Mexico and Central America, avocados are served mixed with white rice, in soups, salads, or on the side of chicken and meat. In Peru, they are consumed with ''[[teque\u00f1o]]s'' as mayonnaise, served as a side dish with ''[[Asado|parrillas]]'', used in salads and sandwiches, or as a whole dish when filled with tuna, shrimp, or chicken. In [[Chile]], it is used as a puree-like sauce with chicken, [[hamburger]]s, and [[hot dog]]s; and in slices for [[celery]] or [[lettuce]] salads. The Chilean version of [[Caesar salad]] contains large slices of mature avocado. In [[Kenya]] and Nigeria, the avocado is often eaten as a fruit eaten alone or mixed with other fruits in a fruit salad, or as part of a vegetable salad.\n\nAvocado is a primary ingredient in [[avocado soup]]. Avocado slices are frequently added to hamburgers, ''[[tortas]]'', [[hot dogs]], and ''[[carne asada]]''. Avocado can be combined with eggs (in scrambled eggs, tortillas, or omelettes), and is a key ingredient in [[California roll]]s and other ''[[makizushi]]'' (\"maki\", or rolled [[sushi]]).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the avocado became available during the 1960s when introduced by [[Sainsbury's]] under the name 'avocado pear'.<ref name=scotsman />\n\n[[File:2015-08-08 09.11.34 unusual avocado (the fertility testicle fruit) variety from Cebu Philippines 2.jpg|thumb|Unusual avocado variety from Cebu, Philippines]]\n\n== Nutritional value ==\n{{nutritional value | name=Avocados, raw\n| water=73.23 g\n| kJ=670\n| protein=2 g\n| fat=14.66 g\n| satfat=2.13 g\n| monofat=9.80 g\n| polyfat=1.82 g\n| carbs=8.53 g\n| fiber=6.7 g\n| sugars=0.66 g\n| calcium_mg=12\n| iron_mg=0.55\n| magnesium_mg=29\n| phosphorus_mg=52\n| potassium_mg=485\n| sodium_mg=7\n| zinc_mg=0.64\n| manganese_mg=0.142\n| opt1n=[[Fluoride]]\n| opt1v=7 \u00b5g\n| opt2n=[[Beta-sitosterol]]\n| opt2v=76 mg\n| vitC_mg=10\n| thiamin_mg=0.067\n| riboflavin_mg=0.13\n| niacin_mg=1.738\n| pantothenic_mg=1.389\n| vitB6_mg=0.257\n| folate_ug=81\n| vitA_ug=7\n| betacarotene_ug=62\n| lutein_ug=271\n| vitE_mg=2.07\n| vitK_ug=21\n| source_usda = 1\n| note=[http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?qlookup=09037&format=Full Link to USDA Database entry]\n}}\n\n=== Nutrients and fat composition ===\nA typical serving of avocado (100 g) is moderate to rich in several [[B vitamins]] and [[vitamin K]], with good content of [[vitamin C]], [[vitamin E]] and [[potassium]] (right table, USDA nutrient data).

North, Central and South American natives originally used the seeds to make red [[body paint]] and [[lipstick]], as well as a spice. For this reason, the achiote is sometimes called the '''lipstick tree'''.\n\nThe tree is best known as the source of [[annatto]], a natural orange-red condiment (also called \"achiote\" or \"bijol\") obtained from the waxy [[aril]]s that cover its seeds. The ground seeds are widely used in traditional dishes in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], [[Mexico]], and the [[Caribbean]], such as ''[[cochinita pibil]]'', chicken in ''achiote'' and ''[[caldo de olla]]''. Annatto and its extracts are also used as an industrial [[food coloring]] to add yellow or orange color to many products such as [[butter]], [[cheese]], [[sausage]]s, [[cake]]s, and [[popcorn]].\n\nThe [[species]] name was given by [[Linnaeus]] after the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Francisco de Orellana]], an early explorer of the [[Amazon River]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Levy |first=Luis W. |last2=Rivadeneira |first2=Diana M. |editor1-last=Lauro |editor1-first=Gabriel J. |editor2-last=Francis |editor2-first=F.

It may also be referred to as ''aploppas'', or by its original [[Tupian languages|Tupi]] name ''uruku'', ''urucu'' or ''urucum'' (\"red color\"), which is also used for the body paint prepared from its seeds.\n\n==Characteristics==\n''Bixa orellana'' is a tall shrub to small evergreen tree {{convert|20-33|ft|m|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} high. It bears clusters of {{convert|2|in|cm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} bright white to pink flowers, resembling single wild roses, appearing at the tips of the branches. The fruits are in clusters: spiky looking red-brown seed pods covered in soft spines. Each pod contains many seeds covered with a thin waxy blood-red [[aril]]. When fully mature, the pod dries, hardens, and splits open, exposing the seeds.\n\nThe color of the seed coating is due mainly to the [[carotenoid]] [[pigment]]s [[bixin]] and [[norbixin]].\n\n==Cultivation==\n[[File:Bixa.jpg|thumb|Achiote flower.]]\n[[File:Bixa orellana fruit roucou kourou 2.jpg|thumb|right|thumb|Mature achiote pods, showing the red seeds.]]\n''Bixa orellana'' originated in South America but it has spread to many parts of the world. It is grown easily and quickly in frost-free regions, from sub-tropical to tropical climates, and sheltered from cool winds. It prefers year-round moisture, good drainage, and moderately fertile soil in full sun or partial shade. It can be propagated from seed and cuttings. Cutting-grown plants flower at a younger age than seedlings.<ref>Lord, Tony (2003) Flora : The Gardener's Bible : More than 20,000 garden plants from around the world. London: Cassell.

Production statistics are not usually available, and would not provide a reliable guide to international trade since many of the producing countries use significant quantities domestically (e.g. Brazil is a large producer and consumer, needing additional imports). Annual world production of dried annatto seed at the beginning of the 21st century was estimated at about 10,000 tons, of which 7,000 tons enter international trade. Peru is the largest exporter of annatto seed, annually about 4,000 tons; Brazil the largest producer with about 5,000 tons. Kenya exports annually about 1,500 tons annatto seed and extracts and is the second-largest exporter, after Peru. C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Angola are also exporters.<ref>{{cite web |first= P.C.M. |last= Jansen |editor-last= Jansen |editor-first= P.C.M. |editor2-last= Cardon |editor2-first= D. |title= Bixa orellana L. |work= PROTA 3: Dyes and tannins/Colorants et tanins. |publisher= PROTA |date= 2005 |url=http://database.prota.org/PROTAhtml/Bixa%20orellana_En.htm |accessdate= 5 Oct 2014 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081120191458/http://database.prota.org/PROTAhtml/Bixa%20orellana_En.htm |archivedate= 20 Nov 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Industrial uses==\n[[File:Urucum virgim oil.JPG|thumb|Oil of ''Bixa orellana'']]\nBefore synthetic dyes revolutionized industry, the tree was planted commercially for the [[pigment]], extracted by solvent or boiling the seeds in oil, which was used to color cheese, margarine, chocolate, fabric and paints.

It grows between 400 and 1000 meters [[above mean sea level]] (ASL).<ref name = ldlletal2003>Le\u00f3n de la Luz ''et al.'' (2003)</ref>\n\nThe entire native population consists of old trees with little successful recruitment for 150 years or so. Until recently, Guadalupe Island supported a large [[domestic goat|goat]] population (estimated at 100,000 in 1870, and 5,000 in 2000). The presence of these goats prevented regrowth of the native trees, including ''B. edulis'', and as a consequence, the ecosystem was drastically altered: the once verdant island turned into an almost barren rock, with weeds replacing the former forests. Below 800\u2013900 m ASL, the palm is essentially the only remaining tree, occurring in a major subpopulation and scattered groups in sheltered locations. Above that, there used to be a band of mixed woodland where the palm was accompanied by [[Island Oak]] and [[Guadalupe Pine]]. This [[habitat]] has now all but disappeared due to the other trees becoming pushed back into higher regions.<ref name = ldlletal2003 />\n\nThe species was probably declining slowly since the mid-19th century. Its range might even have expanded a bit until the mid-20th century however; part of it was shared with other trees as noted above; especially the pine is a towering species that presumably grew in many sites now occupied by the palm. In addition, a forest of [[Guadalupe Cypress]] and [[California Juniper]] shrubland existed in the palm's present range; the cypress forest was eventually destroyed by the goats and the juniper is nowadays completely absent from the island.<ref name = ldlletal2003 />\n\nAlthough endangered in the wild, ''B. edulis'' is cultivated, especially in [[California]]. In 2001, it was started to fence in patches of habitat on Guadalupe, and the long-envisioned removal of goats was effectively complete by 2005. Some hundreds of Guadalupe Palms remain on their island home today.<ref>Johnson (1988), Le\u00f3n de la Luz ''et al.'' (2003)</ref> As regrowth presumably was hindered by the goats eating the saplings rather than the trees having all become old and sterile, it is likely that the palm will eventually recover. That it was best able of all Guadalupe tree species to withstand the hordes of goats is evidenced by its present distribution; the other trees \u2013 if they survive at all \u2013 are limited to higher and less accessible areas. Nonetheless, the species is precariously rare and the [[IUCN]] considers it '''Endangered (EN C1)'''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{aut|Le\u00f3n de la Luz, Jos\u00e9 Luis; Rebman, Jon P. & Oberbauer, Thomas}} (2003): On the urgency of conservation on Guadalupe Island, Mexico: is it a lost paradise?

The plant is known by a range of names in [[Mesoamerican languages|indigenous Mesoamerican]] and other languages, including:  ''ramon, ojoche, ojite, ojushte, ujushte, ujuxte, capomo, mojo, ox, [[iximche]], masica'' in Honduras, ''uje'' in Michoacan, and ''mojote'' in Jalisco, or also ''chokogou'' in Haitian Creole.{{cn|date=March 2017}}\n\nTwo [[subspecies]] are commonly recognized:\n* ''B. a. alicastrum''\n* ''B. a. bolivarense'' <small>(Pittier) C.C.Berg</small>\n\n==Description==\nThe tree can grow up to 45&nbsp;m (130&nbsp;ft) in height.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThis tree is found on the west coast of central Mexico and in southern Mexico (Yucat\u00e1n, Campeche), Guatemala, El Salvador, the Caribbean, and the Amazon.  Large stands occur in moist lowland tropical forests at 300\u20132000 m elevation (especially 125\u2013800 m), in humid areas with rainfall of 600\u20132000&nbsp;mm, and average temperatures of 24&nbsp;\u00b0C (75&nbsp;\u00b0F).<ref>Melgar in \"Utilizacion Integral del Arbol Genero Brosimum\" INCAP 1987</ref>\n\n==History and culture==\nThe breadnut fruit disperses on the ground at different times throughout its range. It has a large seed covered by a thin, citrus-flavored, orange-colored skin favored by a number of forest creatures. More importantly, the large seed which is enveloped by the tasty skin is an edible \u2018nut\u2019 that can be boiled or dried and ground into a meal for [[porridge]] or [[flatbread]]. Breadnut is nutritious and has value as a food source, and may have formed a part of the diet of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of the lowlands region in [[Mesoamerica]],<ref name=\"Flannery, Kent 1982 pp. 353-366\">Flannery, Kent; Puleston, Dennis E.

Production of essential oil is attracting most of the modern interest. Chemical composition, as reflected by aroma, is variable.  The essential oil of Palosanto is generally termed \"Palo Santo Oil\", and has received the [[Chemical Abstract Services]] number, 959130-05-3. When used as an ingredient in cosmetics the [[INCI]] name \"Bursera graveolens wood oil\" should be listed.\n\n===Ethnobotanical uses===\n\nThe use of Palo Santo from ''B. graveolens'' is traditional in South America, especially in [[Ecuador]]. According to the local customs, it is used against the \"mala energ\u00eda\" (bad energy) (\"Palo Santo para limpiar tu casa de la mala energia, Palo Santo para la buena suerte\" or \"Palo Santo to clean your house of bad energy, Palo Santo for good luck\"), which may sometimes refer to clinical disease. Its use reportedly dates back to the [[Inca people|Inca]] era.<ref name=\"Gibson 2008 88\">{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Ruby|title=My Body, My Earth: The Practice of Somatic Archaeology|year=2008|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9780595488230|pages=88}}</ref> Palo Santo is common today as a type of [[incense]].\n\nPalo Santo oil was used during the time of the Incas for its reputed spiritual purifying properties. Today, palo santo oil may be applied to the body (such as at the base of the skull or on the spine) to increase relaxation,<ref name=\"Gibson 2008 88\"/>  similar to [[aromatherapy]].\n\nPalo santo may be burned, similar to incense, by lighting shavings of palo santo wood. In Peru, a [[shaman]], or [[medicine man]], reportedly lights palo santo sticks and the rising smoke will enter the \"energy field\" of ritual participants to \"clear misfortune, negative thoughtprints, and 'evil spirits'\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Lemdo|first=Margaret Ann|title=All About Smudging|year=2011|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|isbn=9780738733142|pages=No page}}</ref> Peruvians harvest fallen branches and twigs of the ''B. graveolens'' tree, a practice that is regulated by the government of Peru, so trees are not cut for wood harvesting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Farmer|first=Steven D.|title=Earth Magic: Ancient Shamanic Wisdom for Healing Yourself, Others, and the Planet|year=2009|publisher=Hay House Inc.|isbn=9781401920050|pages=123}}</ref> The charcoal of palo santo sticks can also be used for ritual smudging.\n\nPalo santo wood has also been used in indigenous medicine in South America.

It is well adapted to several kinds of [[habitat]]s, which include salty and calcareous soils (however, it does not tolerate boggy soils). Due to this fact and its rapid growth, ''B. simaruba'' is planted for various purposes, notably in coastal areas. In addition, gumbo-limbo is also considered one of the most wind-tolerant trees, and it is recommended as a rugged, [[hurricane]]-resistant species in south Florida. They may be planted to serve as wind protection of crops and roads, or as [[Hedge#Live fencing|living fence]] posts, and if simply stuck into good soil, small branches will readily root and grow into sizeable trees in a few years. However, it has been noted in Central America that posts do not produce a tap root, only side roots, thus questioning the real value of wind protection as such fence posts would not be as sturdy as a true, naturally occurring sapling. In addition, gumbo-limbo wood is suitable for light construction<ref>. It is rather brittle, though the trunk is used in [[Haiti]] to make drums (Christman 2004).</ref> and as firewood, and the tree's [[resin]], called '''chibou''', '''cachibou''' or '''gomartis''',<ref name=christman2004 /> is used as glue, varnish and [[incense]].<ref name=foster2007 /><ref name=uflorida /> Gumbo-limbo is the traditional wood used for the manufacture of [[carousel]] horses in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe arils are an important source of food for birds, including many [[bird migration|winter migrants]] from North America. Local residents such as the [[masked tityra]], [[bright-rumped attila]], [[black-faced grosbeak]] and, in [[Hispaniola]], [[palmchat]], are particularly fond of gumbo-limbo fruit, as are migrants like the [[Baltimore oriole]] or the [[dusky-capped flycatcher]]. It is an especially important local food source for [[vireo]]s such the [[red-eyed vireo]] when ripe fruit are abundant. Especially notable is the fact that many migrant species will utilize gumbo-limbo trees that are in human-modified [[habitat]], even in settlements. This creates the opportunity to attract such species to residential areas for [[bird watching]], and to reduce the competition for gumbo-limbo seeds in an undisturbed habitat which rarer local resident birds might face. In addition, gumbo-limbo's rapid growth, ease and low cost of propagation, and ecological versatility makes it highly recommended as a \"starter\" tree in [[reforestation]], even of degraded habitat, and it performs much better overall in such a role than most exotic species.<ref name=foster2007 /><ref>{{aut|Foster, Mercedes S.}} (2007): The potential of fruiting trees to enhance converted habitats for migrating birds in southern Mexico.

It is valued for its small, sweet, yellow [[fruit]], which are strongly scented. The fruits have a very pungent and distinct flavor and smell. The taste is not comparable to any other fruit. Common names include '''changunga''', '''muru\u00e7i''', '''nanche''', '''nance''', '''chacunga''', '''craboo''', '''kraabu''', '''savanna serrette''' (or savanna serret) and '''golden spoon'''.\n\n==Description and habitat==\n\n''Byrsonima crassifolia'' is a slow-growing large shrub or tree to 33 ft (10 m).  Sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits, the tree is native and abundant in the wild, sometimes in extensive stands, in open [[Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|pine forests]] and grassy [[savanna]]s, from central [[Mexico]], through [[Central America]], to [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Brazil]]; it also occurs in [[Trinidad]], [[Barbados]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[St. Martin]], [[Dominica]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Haiti]], the [[Dominican Republic]] and throughout [[Cuba]] and the [[Isla de la Juventud|Isle of Pines]].  The nance is limited to tropical and subtropical climates. In Central and [[South America]], the tree ranges from sea-level to an altitude of 6,000 ft (1,800 m). It is highly drought-tolerant.\n\n==Example ecoregions of occurrence==\nFound in a number of tropical and subtropical ecoregions of the Americas that feature conifers, an example ecoregion of occurrence for ''B. crassifolia'' is the [[Belizean pine forests]].<ref>C. Michael Hogan & World Wildlife Fund. 2012. [http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/51cbed0e7896bb431f68f5bd/ Belizean pine forests. ed. M. McGinley. Encyclopedia of Earth. Washington DC]</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:2010.05.03.183848 Nance Guatemala City.jpg|thumb|left|Nance from [[Guatemala City]], [[Guatemala]]]]\nThe fruits are eaten raw or cooked as dessert. In rural [[Panama]], the dessert prepared with the addition of sugar and flour, known as ''pesada de nance,'' is quite popular. The fruits are also made into ''dulce de nance,'' a candy prepared with the fruit cooked in sugar and water. In [[Nicaragua]] (where the fruit is called ''nancite''), it is a popular ingredient for several desserts, including ''raspados'' (mixed with ice).\n\nThe fruits are also often used to prepare [[Carbonation|carbonated]] beverages, ice cream and juice, in Brazil, flavor [[mezcal]]-based [[liqueur]]s, or make an oily, acidic, fermented beverage known as ''[[chicha]],'' the standard term applied to assorted beer-like drinks made of fruits or maize. Nance is used to distill a [[rum]]-like liquor called ''crema de nance'' in Costa Rica. Mexico produces a ''licor de nanche''.\n{{clear-left}}\n==See also==\n* [[List of plants of Cerrado vegetation of Brazil]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Byrsonima crassifolia|''Byrsonima crassifolia''}}\n{{wikispecies-inline}}\n*[http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/Nance.html Purdue.edu: ''Byrsonima crassifolia'']\n\n[[Category:Byrsonima|crassifolia]]\n[[Category:Tropical fruit]]\n[[Category:Trees of Central America]]\n[[Category:Trees of Barbados]]\n[[Category:Trees of Cuba]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Trees of northern South America]]\n[[Category:Trees of Brazil]]\n[[Category:Trees of Bolivia]]\n[[Category:Trees of Peru]]\n[[Category:Trees of Paraguay]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Dominican Republic]]\n[[Category:Trees of Haiti]]\n[[Category:Trees of Cura\u00e7ao]]\n[[Category:Trees of Dominica]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guadeloupe]]\n[[Category:Trees of \u00celes des Saintes]]\n[[Category:Trees of Saint Martin and Saint Barth\u00e9lemy]]\n[[Category:Trees of Trinidad and Tobago]]\n[[Category:Flora of Central Mexico]]\n[[Category:Flora of Southern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1822]]",

The bark is smooth and greenish-grey, becoming shallowly fissured in all old trees. The leaves are alternate, {{convert|3|\u2013|12|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long, with prominent veins giving a distinctive corrugated texture, and a serrated margin. The male and female [[catkin]]s appear in spring at the same time as the leaves. The fruit is a small {{convert|7|\u2013|8|mm|in|frac=32|sp=us|adj=on|abbr=off}} long nut, partially surrounded by a three- to seven-pointed leafy [[Involucral bract|involucre]] {{convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long; it matures in autumn. The seeds often do not germinate till the spring of the second year after maturating.\n\n* Bark: On old trees near the base, furrowed.  Young trees and branches smooth, dark bluish gray, sometimes furrowed, light and dark gray.  Branchlets at first pale green, changing to reddish brown, ultimately dull gray.\n* Wood: Light brown, [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] nearly white; heavy, hard, close-grained, very strong.  Used for levers, handles of tools.  Specific gravity, 0.7286; weight {{convert|45.41|lb}}.\n* Winter buds: Ovate, acute, chestnut brown, {{convert|1/8|in|mm|0}} long.  Inner scales enlarge when spring growth begins.  No terminal bud is formed.\n* Leaves: Alternate, two to four inches long, ovate-oblong, rounded, wedge-shaped, or rarely subcordate and often unequal at base, sharply and doubly serrate, acute or acuminate.  They come out of the bud pale bronze green and hairy; when full grown they are dull deep green above, paler beneath; feather-veined, midrib and veins very prominent on under side.  In autumn bright red, deep scarlet and orange. [[Petiole (botany)|Petioles]] short, slender, hairy.  [[Stipules]] [[caducous]].\n* Flowers: April.  [[Mon\u0153cious]], without [[petal]]s, the [[staminate]] [[spike (botany)|spike]] naked in pendulous [[catkin]]s (aments).  The staminate ament buds are axillary and form in the autumn. During the winter they resemble leaf-buds, only twice as large. They begin to lengthen very early in the spring, and when full grown are about {{convert|1+1/2|in|cm|0}} long.  The staminate flower is composed of three to twenty stamens crowded on a hairy torus, adnate to the base of a broadly ovate, acute boot-shaped scale, green below the middle, bright red at apex.  The pistillate aments are one-half to three-fourths of an inch long with ovate, acute, hairy, green scales and bright scarlet styles.\n* Fruit: Clusters of involucres, hanging from the ends of leafy branches.  Each involucre slightly encloses a small oval nut.  The involucres are short stalked, usually three-lobed, though one lobe is often wanting; halberd-shaped, coarsely serrated on one margin, or entire.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book\n  | last =Keeler\n  | first =Harriet L.\n  | title =Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them\n  | publisher =Charles Scriber's Sons\n  | year =1900\n  | location =New York\n  | pages =319\u2013322 }}</ref>\n\n==Subdivisions==\nThere are two [[subspecies]], which intergrade extensively where they meet:\n*''Carpinus caroliniana'' subsp.

Little is known of the growth rate of nutmeg hickory. Logs and lumber are sold mixed with other hickories. The nuts are an oil-rich food for wildlife.\n\n==Habitat==\n\n===Native range===\nNutmeg hickory is the rarest species in the genus, occurring in a few areas scattered in southeastern [[North Carolina]], eastern [[South Carolina]], central [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]], northern [[Louisiana]], southern [[Arkansas]], eastern [[Texas]], and northeastern Mexico. The species is typically found in river bottomlands with [[calcareous soil]] or [[marl]] ridges.<ref>Stone, Donald E. 1997. [http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233500319 \"Carya myristiciformis\"]. In Flora of North America, vol. 3, Oxford University Press, New York, pp. 420-421. Accessed June 2, 2008</ref> The species is abundant only near [[Selma, Alabama]], and in southern Arkansas. Nutmeg hickory has a native range nearly identical with that of Durand Oak (''Q. durandii'' var. ''durandii''). Both may be relics of a more ancient flora than now occupies the region.<ref name=Maisenhelder>{{cite book|author=Maisenhelder, Louis C. |year=1965 |chapter=Nutmeg hickory (''Carya myristicaeformis'' (Michx. f.) Nutt.) |title=Silvics of forest trees of the United States |pages=119\u2013120 |editor=H. A. Fowells (ed.) |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture |series=Agriculture Handbook 271 |location=Washington, DC.}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nPrecipitation within the range of nutmeg hickory varies from 1020 to 1400&nbsp;mm (40 to 55 in) per year, 510&nbsp;mm (20&nbsp;in) or more falling during the growing season. The frost-free period of most of the native range is about 240 days. Summers are warm and dry in the western portion of the range, but warm and wet in the South Carolina disjuncts. July temperatures average about 27\u00b0C (80\u00b0F). January temperatures average between 7\u00b0 and 10\u00b0C (45\u00b0 and 50\u00b0F). Extremes of temperature are -23\u00b0 to 43\u00b0C (-10\u00b0 to 110\u00b0F).\n\n===Soils and topography===\nNutmeg hickory grows on a variety of loamy, silty, or clayey soils that may be described as moist, but well or moderately well drained and amply supplied with mineral nutrients. The species most often is found in minor stream bottoms, on second bottom flats, and on slopes or bluffs near streams. The principal soils on which nutmeg hickory is generally found are in the orders [[Alfisol]]s and [[Inceptisol]]s.\n\n===Associated forest cover===\nNutmeg hickory is not an important species in any forest cover type and is only a minor associate in Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak ([[Society of American Foresters]] Type 91).<ref>Eyre, F. H., ed. 1980. Forest cover types of the United States and Canada. Society of American Foresters, Washington, DC. 148 p.</ref> Other prominent associates in this type include [[white ash]] (''Fraxinus americana''); [[Carya ovata|shagbark hickory]](''Carya ovata''), [[Carya laciniosa|shellbark hickory]](''Carya laciniosa''), [[Carya tomentosa|mockernut hickory]](''C. tomentosa''), and [[Carya cordiformis|bitternut hickory]] (''Carya cordiformis''); [[Shumard oak]] (''Quercus shumardii''); and [[blackgum]] (''Nyssa sylvatica''). Less important associates are [[willow oak]](''Quercus phellos''), [[water oak]](''Qercus nigra''), and [[Oak|Durand oaks]] (''Quercus durandii''); [[American elm]] (''Ulmus americana'') and [[Ulmus alata|winged elms]] (''Ulmus alata''); [[yellow-poplar]] (''Liriodendron tulipifera''); and [[American beech]] (''Fagus grandifolia''). Some common small trees and shrubs occurring with nutmeg hickory are [[Hophornbeam|eastern hophornbeam]] (''Ostrya uirginiana''), [[American hornbeam]] (''Carpinus caroliniana''), [[flowering dogwood]] (''Cornus florida''), and [[oakleaf hydrangea]] (''Hydrangea quercifolia''). One survey near [[Charleston, SC]], found [[red buckeye]] (''Aesculus pavia''), [[eastern redbud]] (''Cercis canadensis''), and [[witch-hazel]] (''Hamamelis virginiana'') associated with nutmeg hickory.<ref name=Maisenhelder/>\n\n==Life history==\n\n===Reproduction and early growth===\n\nThe species is [[monoecious]] and forms imperfect flowers. Both male and female flowers are found on the current year's growth. The male flowers are long-stalked [[catkin]]s, developing at the shoot base.<ref>Sargent, Charles Sprague. 1965. Manual of the trees of North America. vol. 1. Dover, New York. (Reprint of 1926 revision, Houghton Mifflin, New York.) 934 p.</ref> The female flowers are in short spikes on [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncles]] at the end of the shoot. Flowering occurs from April to May, shortly after the leaves have started to open. Specifies of pollen production, dissemination and pollination are not known. The sweet, edible nut matures from September to October of the same year and falls between September and December. Its ellipsoidal shell is thick and hard.\n\nSeed production starts when the trees are about 30 years old, and optimum seed-bearing age is 50 to 125 years.<ref name=Maisenhelder/> Good seed crops are produced every 2 to 3 years. As many as 70 liters (2 bu) can be produced by an open-grown tree. Seeds are disseminated by various methods, including squirrels and water.\n\nThe seeds of this species germinate from late April to early June. Germination is [[hypogeal germination|hypogeal]]. Burial of seeds by squirrels seems to be important, but it is not necessary for the successful establishment of seedlings.\n\nSpecific information on the vegetative reproduction of nutmeg hickory is not available. Like other hickories, it probably sprouts readily from small stumps, injured or top-killed seedlings and saplings, and from roots.<ref>Boisen, Anton T., and J. A. Newlin. 1910. The commercial hickories. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bulletin 80. Washington, DC. 64 p.</ref>  Large stumps do not readily sprout, hence the larger the stump, the more likely that it will reproduce only by root suckers.\n\n===Sapling and pole stages to maturity===\nNutmeg hickory is a medium-sized tree with a tall, straight trunk and stout, slightly spreading branches that form a narrow and rather open crown. It can attain heights of 24 to 30 in (80 to 100&nbsp;ft) and a diameter of 61&nbsp;cm (24&nbsp;in).\n\nAlthough the pecan hickories (which include nutmeg hickory) grow more rapidly than the true hickories,<ref>Nelson, Thomas C. 1965. Silvical characteristics of the commercial hickories. USDA Forest Service, Hickory Task Force Report 10. Southeastern Forest Experiment Station, Asheville, NC. 16 p.</ref> specific information on the growth rate of nutmeg hickory is lacking. The pecan hickories, in turn, grow more slowly than most other bottom-land hardwoods. The average 10-year diameter increase for hickories in natural, unmanaged stands in the northeast Louisiana delta was 4.3&nbsp;cm (1.7&nbsp;in) in the 15- to 30-cm (6- to 12-in) diameter class; 3.3&nbsp;cm (1.3&nbsp;in) in the 33- to 48-cm (13- to 19-in) diameter class; and 3.8&nbsp;cm (1.5&nbsp;in) in the 51- to 71-cm (20- to 28-in) diameter class.<ref name=Maisenhelder/>\n\nPure stands of nutmeg hickory probably do not exist, and no volume figures are available. Logs and lumber from merchantable nutmeg hickory are sold mixed with other hickories. \n\nRooting Habit- Nutmeg hickory has a strongly developed taproot, especially on well-drained soil. Seedlings of hickory quickly develop a heavy taproot and fine lateral roots. During the pole stage, a robust, spreading lateral root system is developed.\n\nNutmeg hickory is classed as intolerant of shade. It is intolerant as a mature tree, but tolerant in the seedling and sapling stage during which it may survive for a long time in the understory and then respond to release.<ref name=Maisenhelder/> Any partial cutting system that removes larger, faster-growing competition encourages nutmeg hickory.\n\nFire damages hickory of all ages. A light burn kills the tops of seedlings and saplings; a more intense fire wounds larger trees and provides entry for [[butt-rotting fungus|butt-rotting fungi]].\n\nSeveral insects attack hickory but rarely become epidemic.<ref>Baker, Whiteford L. 1972. Eastern forest insects. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Miscellaneous Publication 1175. Washington, DC. 642 p.</ref> The [[Malacosoma disstria|forest tent caterpillar]] (''Malacosoma disstria''), [[Datana|walnut caterpillar]] (''Datana integerima''), and [[Diapheromera femorata|walkingstick]] (''Diapheromera femorata'') may defoliate individual trees or limbs. Sucking insects, including [[aphid]]s (Monellia spp.), feed on the underside of leaves, causing them to curl and drop prematurely. The [[Oncideres cingulata|twig girdler]] (''Oncideres cingulata'') may seriously prune seedlings and even large trees by girdling the terminal and branches. The [[Scolytus quadrispinosus|hickory bark beetle]] (''Scolytus quadrispinosus'') can be troublesome during dry years and periods of stress.\n\nThe [[ambrosia beetle]] (Platypus spp. and Xyleborus spp.) and [[powderpost beetle]]s (Lyctus spp. and Xylobiops basilaris) often cause economic damage to logs and lumber during storage and air-drying.\n\nNo important diseases of hickory other than a number of wood rots have been reported. Bird peck defect, caused by the [[yellow-bellied sapsucker]], is common and serious in nutmeg hickory.\n\n==Special uses==\nThe nuts of nutmeg hickory are relished by squirrels, which begin cutting them while they are still green.<ref>Halls, Lowell K. 1977. Southern fruit-producing woody plants used by wildlife. USDA Forest Service, General Technical Report SO-16. Southern Forest Experiment Station, New Orleans, LA. 235 p.</ref> Other rodents and wildlife also eat the nuts. The species is too rare over most of its range to be of major economic importance. The wood of this pecan hickory is slightly inferior in strength and toughness to that of the true or upland hickories, but owing to the small volumes involved and difficulty of distinguishing it from the true hickories, nutmeg hickory is not separated from them during logging.\n\n==Genetics==\nNo racial varieties or hybrids have been reported for nutmeg hickory.\n\n==Literature cited==\n{{wikispecies|Carya myristiciformis}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{USGovernment|sourceURL=[http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/table_of_contents.shtm Silvics of North America; volume 2: Hardwoods], [[United States Department of Agriculture]] [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]]}}\n\n[[Category:Carya|myristiciformis]]\n[[Category:Edible nuts and seeds]]\n[[Category:Crops originating from the United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]",

The tallest measured shagbark, located in Savage Gulf, Tennessee, is over {{convert|150|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall.  Mature shagbarks are easy to recognize because, as their name implies, they have shaggy bark.

They are unsuitable to commercial or orchard production due to the long time it takes for a tree to produce sizable crops and unpredictable output from year to year. Shagbark hickories can grow to enormous sizes but are unreliable bearers. The nuts can be used as a substitute for the [[pecan]] in colder climates and have nearly the same culinary function.\n\n''C. ovata'' begins producing seeds at about 10 years of age, but large quantities are not produced until 40 years and will continue for at least 100. Nut production is erratic, with good crops every 3 to 5 years, in between which few or none appear and the entire crop may be lost to animal predation.\n\n[[Andrew Jackson]], the seventh president of the United States, was popularly nicknamed Old Hickory, a play on the toughness of hickory wood. In 1830, he began planning the construction of his tomb at [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]], his plantation in [[Tennessee]]. The grave site was surrounded by a variety of trees, including six shagbark hickories. They stood there for 168 years until a storm in 1998 demolished over 1,200 trees at the site. Work on replanting them remains an ongoing project. In modern times, shagbark hickory is rarely used as an ornamental due to its large size, slow growth, difficulty of transplanting (all Juglandacaea species have large taproots) and nut litter.\n\n\"Hickory\" is derived from ''pawcohiccora'', an Algonquian Indian word for the tree's oily nutmeat.\n<ref name=Hilton />  The nuts were a food source for Native Americans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/carya/species/ovata/ovata.htm |last=Grauke |first=LJ |publisher=Texas A&M University, Department of Horticultural Science |title=Hickories: ''Carya ovata''|accessdate=2013-08-10}}</ref>\n\nShagbark hickory [[wood]] is used for [[smoking (food)|smoking]] [[meat]] and for making the [[bow (weapon)|bows]] of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of the northern area.

''x'' dunbarii'' Sarg.). Shagbark hickory has 32 chromosomes. In general, species within the genus with the same chromosome number are able to cross. Numerous hybrids among the ''Carya'' species with 32 chromosomes (pecan, [[Carya cordiformis|bitternut]], [[Carya laciniosa|shellbark]], and shagbark) have been described, though most are unproductive or have other flaws.

The most recent revision reduced the number of species in the genus to seven (Styles, 1981). The common cedro, ''Cedrela odorata'' L., embraces 28 other synonyms, including ''C.&nbsp;mexicana'' M. J. Roem. The taxon \"''C.&nbsp;angustifolia'',\" a very vigorous type now in demand because of its apparent resistance to the shootborer, was left in an indeterminate status due to insufficient herbarium material. The result is that ''C.&nbsp;odorata'' as now constituted is a species showing a high degree of population variation.\n\n==Repartition==\n[[File:Cedrela odorata trunk.JPG|thumb|left|Close-up of the trunk]]\nCedro is a tree of the New World tropics, appearing in forests of moist and seasonally dry subtropical or tropical life zones (24) from [[26th parallel north|latitude 26\u00b0N]]. on the Pacific coast of [[Mexico]], throughout [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]], to the lowlands and foothills of most of [[South America]] up to {{convert|1200|m}} altitude, finding its southern limit at about [[28th parallel south|latitude 28\u00b0S]] in [[Argentina]]. It has become a troublesome invasive species in the [[Galapagos Islands]].<ref>http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/SA/Ecuador/Galapagos/ScalesiaSantaCruz.htm</ref> Cedro is always found naturally on well-drained soils, often but not exclusively on [[limestone]]; it tolerates a long dry season but does not flourish in areas of rainfall greater than about {{convert|3000|mm}} or on sites with heavy or waterlogged soils. Individual trees are generally scattered in mixed semi-evergreen or semi-deciduous forests dominated by other species.  [[Mahogany]], a close relative, is often found with cedro and both suffer damage from the same pest, the mahogany shootborer (''[[Hypsipyla grandella]]'').\n\n==Description==\nThe tree is [[monoecious]] semi-[[deciduous]] ranging in height from {{convert|10|to|30|m|abbr=on}}. The trunk has a thick grey\u2013brown bark, with longitudinal irregular grain. Pinnately compound leaves, grouped towards the end of the branches, {{convert|15|-|50|cm|abbr=on}} long, with pairs of scythe-shaped leaflets, lanceolate to oblong, {{convert|7|-|15|cm|abbr=on}} \u00d7 {{convert|3|-|5|cm|abbr=on}} with the base obliquely truncated and asymmetric.\n\n==Uses==\n''Cedrela odorata'' is the most commercially important and widely distributed species in the genus ''Cedrela''. Known as Spanish cedar in English commerce, the aromatic wood is in high demand in the American tropics because it is naturally [[termite]]- and rot-resistant. An attractive, moderately lightweight wood (specific gravity 0.4), its primary use is in household articles used to store clothing. Cedro [[heartwood]] contains an aromatic and [[insect]]-repelling [[resin]] that is the source of its popular name, Spanish-cedar (it resembles the aroma of true cedars (''[[Cedrus]]'' spp.) Cedro works easily and makes excellent [[plywood]] and [[Wood veneer|veneer]] and would be more widely used if it could be successfully [[Plantation#Forestry|plantation]] grown. This plant is often used for [[honey]] production ([[beekeeping]]) and [[humidor]] construction. It is occasionally used for tops or veneers on some kinds of [[electric guitars]]. The wood is the traditional choice for making the neck of [[flamenco]] and [[classical guitar]]s.<ref>Romanillos, J.L.

They tend to tolerate a wide range of [[soil pH|pH]] conditions, from 4.8 to 8.0. Trees can be planted at 5\u20138 months after seed germination when the roots have extended to the bottom of the growing bags. Plantations need to be started during the rainy season.\n\n==References==\n*Quesada, J.F., Jim\u00e9nez, Q., Zamora, N., Aguila, R., Gonzalez, J. 1997. Arboles de la Pen\u00ednsula de Osa.

''erectus'' - '''green buttonwood''', leaves thinly hairy or hairless\n*''Conocarpus erectus'' var. ''sericeus'' - '''silver buttonwood''', leaves densely silvery-hairy\n\n==Uses==\nThe tree is used as an [[ornamental plant]] and in [[bonsai]]. The variety ''sericeus'', with silvery leaves, is especially prized for landscaping. It is an important host plant for [[epiphyte]]s. As a result of ornamental planting, it has become [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] in [[Hawaii]]. It has been used extensively in landscaping in [[Kuwait]] and became the most abundant tree/shrub.  Conocarpus is widely believed to be fodder for the [[African buffalo]], and it is understood that this is the source of their acidic urine.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  \n\nThe [[wood]] is sometimes used in cabinets; it is difficult to work but takes a smooth finish. It is also used as [[firewood]], and is reported to be good for [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]] meat and fish, as it burns very hot and slowly; it also makes high quality [[charcoal]]. The [[bark]] is high in [[tannin]], for which it has been harvested commercially.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Changes in global mangrove distributions]]\n*[[Ecological values of mangrove]]\n*[[:Category:Mangrove ecoregions|Mangrove ecoregions]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n*[http://www.fs.fed.us/global/iitf/pdf/shrubs/Conocarpus%20erectus.pdf USDA Forest Service: ''Conocarpus erectus''] (pdf file)\n*[http://www2.fpl.fs.fed.us/TechSheets/HardwoodNA/htmlDocs/conocarp.html Center for Wood Anatomy Research] - retrieved July 1, 2006\n*[http://www.sfrc.ufl.edu/4h/Buttonwood/buttwood.htm Florida Forest Trees - Buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus)] - retrieved July 1, 2006\n*[http://www.bonsai-bsf.com/bwood.html A Collection of Articles About Buttonwood from Issues of the ''Florida Bonsai Magazine''] - retrieved July 1, 2006\n*[http://www.regionalconservation.org/beta/nfyn/plantdetail.asp?tx=Conoerec Natives for your neighborhood - Buttonwood] - retrieved July 1, 2006\n*[http://www.sfrc.ufl.edu/Extension/pubtxt/for43.htm Mangroves-Florida's Coastal Trees] - retrieved July 4, 2006\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commonscat-inline}}\n\n{{Tannin source}}\n\n[[Category:Conocarpus|erectus]]\n[[Category:Mangroves]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Flora of West Africa]]\n[[Category:Trees of Bermuda]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Caribbean]]\n[[Category:Trees of Central America]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of South America]]\n[[Category:Trees of Peru]]",

It has also been introduced to [[Belize]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Nicaragua]], growing at {{convert|1200|-|3000|m|ft}} altitude.\n\nThe scientific name ''lusitanica'' (of [[Portugal]]) refers to its very early cultivation there, with plants imported from Mexico to the monastery at [[Bu\u00e7aco]], near [[Coimbra]] in Portugal in about 1634; these trees were already over 130 years old when the species was botanically described by [[Philip Miller|Miller]] in 1768.\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Description==\n''Cupressus lusitanica'' is an [[evergreen]] [[conifer]] tree with a conic to ovoid-conic crown, growing to 40 m tall. The foliage grows in dense sprays, dark green to somewhat yellow-green in colour. The leaves are scale-like, 2\u20135&nbsp;mm long, and produced on rounded (not flattened) shoots. The seed [[conifer cone|cones]] are globose to oblong, 10\u201320&nbsp;mm long, with four to 10 scales, green at first, maturing brown or grey-brown about 25 months after pollination.\n\nThe cones may either open at maturity to release the seeds, or remain closed for several years, only opening after the parent tree is killed in a [[wildfire]], allowing the [[seed]]s to colonise the bare ground exposed by the fire. The male cones are 3\u20134&nbsp;mm long, and release pollen in February\u2013March. In most of its natural environment rainfall\noccurs with more quantity in summer.\n\n===Varieties===\nThere are two [[variety (biology)|varieties]], treated as distinct species by some botanists:\n* '''''Cupressus lusitanica'' var. ''lusitanica''''' (syn. ''C. lindleyi'') - '''Mexican Cypress''' - Foliage in three-dimensional sprays, with small shoots in two planes. Occurs in lower rainfall areas. ([[Least concern]] species)\n* '''''Cupressus lusitanica'' var. ''benthamii''''' (syn. ''C. benthamii'') - '''Bentham's Cypress''' -  Foliage in flattened sprays, with small shoots all in one plane. Occurs in higher rainfall areas. ([[Near Threatened]] species)\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\nFast-growing and drought tolerant, ''Cupressus lusitanica'' has been introduced from Mexico's provenances to different parts of the world. It is widely cultivated, both as an [[ornamental tree]] and for [[timber]] production, in warm, temperate and subtropical regions around the world. Trees have not been selected for cultivation from northern Mexico populations, which have a heavy drought endurance<ref>Felfer Richard S., Johnson B. Matthew, Wilson Michael F. 2001. The trees of Sonora, Mexico. Oxford University Press. New York City. U.S.A. ISBN 0-19-512891-5</ref>\n\n===Locations===\nIts cultivation and subsequent [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalisation]] in parts of southern [[Asia]] has caused a degree of confusion with native ''Cupressus'' species in that region; plants sold by nurseries under the names of Asian species such as ''[[Cupressus torulosa]]'' often prove to be this species.\nIt has been planted widely for commercial production: at high altitudes in [[Colombia]] (3300 m), [[Bolivia]] and [[South Africa]], and near sea level in [[New Zealand]] where is fully naturalized.

They are sensitive to drought, requiring irrigation in dry areas, but are quite tolerant of flooding. The tree grows fairly slowly for the first 3\u20134 years, perhaps just 1 foot/year for the first couple of years.<ref name=\"Morton\"/> Later however it grows much more rapidly. Trees should be spaced 10-12m apart.<ref name=\"w-a-f\"/>\n\n==Cultivars==\nThe range in size of tree and hairiness of leaves; size, shape, seediness, flesh color and sweetness of fruit; and time of fruiting suggest that considerable genetic variability exists.

Secondary [[veins]] are thin, generally indistinct; Veins: often 6 to 10 pairs, indifferently opposite, subopposite, and alternate, camptodrome. Venation branches from the midrib at different angles, which may vary from 12\u00b0 to 70\u00b0. The basal veins are very ascending in some plants: the angle of divergence may be close to 45\u00b0. The basal secondary venation branches from a point near the base of the main vein and becomes parallel with the leaf margin, with the distance of 1 millimeter to 2 millimeters from the edges.

Its seeds are elliptic, smooth, glossy, coral-red, with a salient longitudinal line on the back, and with a white hilum surrounded by a black border.\n\n==Uses==\nIts white [[wood]] is used for making [[bung]]s and, especially in [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]], figurines.  The clusters of red and white flowers on the Naked Coral Tree make it an attractive [[ornamental plant|ornamental]]. The flowers are also used as a food source. \n\n==Phytochemistry==\nThe seeds are very poisonous, containing [[erythroidine]], a powerful [[muscle relaxant]]; [[erythroresin]], an [[emetic]]; [[coralin]]; and [[erythric acid]]. The extract has been suggested as a substitute for [[curare]]. An analysis by Rio de la Loza showed the seeds contain 13.35 solid and liquid [[fat]], 0.32 [[resin]] soluble in [[ether]], 13.47 resin soluble in [[alcohol]], 1.61 [[erythrococalloidine]], an [[alkaloid]], 5.60 [[albumen]], 0.83 [[Natural gum|gum]], 1.55 [[sugar]], 0.42 [[organic acid]], 15.87 [[starch]], 7.15 [[moisture]] and 39.15 [[inorganic matter]]. <!-- and cellulose?\n -->\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{commonscat}}\n{{wikispecies}}\n*{{cite journal |first=John M. |last=Maisch |title=Materia Medica of the New Mexican Pharmacopoeia - Part 5 |journal=American Journal of Pharmacy |volume=57 |issue=9 |date=September 1885}}\n*{{cite book |first=Joseph P. |last=Remington |author2=Horatio C.

Though they are edible like most figs, as the [[scientific name]] (literally \"insipid fig\") implies they are of unremarkable taste. Monkeys feed on fruits still on the tree, and fallen fruits are eaten by [[peccary|peccaries]].\n\nTwo [[subspecies]] can be distinguished:\n* ''Ficus insipida'' ssp.

Figs belong to the family [[Moraceae]]. The specific epithet ''maxima'' was coined by Scottish botanist [[Philip Miller]] in 1768; Miller's name was applied to this species in the ''Flora of Jamaica'', but it was later determined that Miller's description was actually of the species now known as ''[[Ficus aurea]]''. To avoid confusion, Cornelis Berg proposed that the name should be conserved for this species. Berg's proposal was accepted in 2005.\n\nIndividuals may reach heights of {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Like all figs it has an obligate [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] with [[fig wasp]]s; ''F. maxima'' is only pollinated by the fig wasp ''[[Tetrapus americanus]]'', and ''T. americanus'' only reproduces in its flowers.  ''F. maxima'' fruit and leaves are important food resources for a variety of birds and mammals. It is used in a number of [[herbal medicines]] across its range.\n\n==Description==\n''Ficus maxima'' is a tree which ranges from {{convert|5|\u2013|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. Leaves vary in shape from long and narrow to more oval, and range from 6\u201324&nbsp;(cm) (2\u20139&nbsp;in) long and from {{convert|2.5|\u2013|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name=DeWolf>DeWolf, Gordon P., Jr. 1960.

Sloane's illustration of this plant (published in his 1725 '' A voyage to the islands Madera, Barbados, Nieves, S. Christophers and Jamaica'') depicted it with figs borne singly, a characteristic of the ''Ficus'' subgenus ''Pharmacosycea''. A closer examination of Sloane's description led Cornelis Berg to conclude that the illustration depicted a member of the subgenus ''[[Urostigma]]'', almost certainly ''[[Ficus aurea|F. aurea]]'', and that the illustration of singly borne figs was probably [[artistic license]]. Berg located the plant collection upon which Sloane's illustration was based and concluded that Miller's ''F. maxima'' was, in fact, ''F. aurea''.<ref name = Berg2003/>\n\nIn 1806 the name ''Ficus radula'' was applied to material belonging to this species. The description, based on material collected in [[Venezuela]] by [[Germans|German]] naturalist [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[French people|French]] botanist [[Aim\u00e9 Bonpland]], was published in [[Carl Ludwig Willdenow]]'s fourth edition of Linnaeus' ''[[Species Plantarum]]''. This is the oldest description that can unequivocally be applied to this species.<ref name = Berg2003/>  In 1847 [[Danish people|Danish]] botanist [[Frederik Michael Liebmann]] applied the name ''Pharmacosycea glaucescens'' to Mexican material belonging to this species.<ref name=MoBot/>  (It was transferred to the genus ''Ficus'' by [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] botanist [[Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel]] in 1867.)<ref name=MoBot/>  In 1849 the name ''Ficus suffocans'' was applied to Jamaican material belonging to this species in [[August Grisebach]]'s  ''Flora of the British West Indian Islands''.<ref name = Griseb>{{cite book|last=Grisebach|first=August |authorlink=August Grisebach|title=Flora of the British West Indian Islands|url=http://www.botanicus.org/bibliography/b11788513|accessdate=2008-07-02|volume=1|publisher=L.

''Ficus maxima'' is pollinated by ''[[Tetrapus americanus]]'',<ref name = Jousselin2004/> although recent work suggests that the species known as ''T. americanus'' is a [[cryptic species complex]] of at least two species, which are not [[Cladistics#Subtrees are clades|sister taxa]].<ref name = Molbo2003>{{cite journal | last = Molbo | first = Drude |author2=Carlos A.

Female wasps of this species are about {{convert|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and are capable of producing about 190 offspring.<ref name = Jousselin2004/>\n\nFemale fig wasps arrive carrying pollen from their natal tree and squeeze their way through the ostiole into the interior of the syconium. The syncomium bears 500\u2013600 female flowers arranged in multiple layers - those that are closer to the outer wall of the fig have short [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]]s and long [[Gynoecium#Carpel anatomy|styles]], while those that are located closer to the interior of the chamber have long pedicels and short styles. Female wasps generally [[oviposition|lay their eggs]] in the short-styled flowers, while longer-styled flowers were more likely to be pollinated. The eggs hatch and the larvae parasitise the flowers in which they were laid. Pollinated flowers which have not been parasitised give rise to seeds.<ref name = Jousselin2004/>\n\nMale wasps mature and emerge before the females.

It is commonly called '''''genipapo''''', '''''huito''''', or '''''jagua''''', although the name ''jagua'' is also used for other ''Genipa'' species. The [[Inca]] called it '''''hawa''''' or '''''wituq'''''. In the British islands of the West Indies, it was called the '''''marmalade box'''''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004234809/http://www.biotrade.org/docs/biotradebrief-genipaamericana.pdf HTMLized .pdf] UNITED NATIONS CONFERENCE ON TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT - Market Brief in the European Union for selected natural ingredients derived from native species: ''Genipa americana, Jagua, huito'' (accessed 12 March 2006)</ref>\n\n==Description==\nIt is a small [[tree]] growing to 15 m tall. The [[leaf|leaves]] are opposite, lanceolate to oblong, 20\u201335&nbsp;cm long and 10\u201319&nbsp;cm broad, glossy dark green, with an entire margin. The [[flower]]s are white, yellow or red, with a five-lobed corolla 5\u20136&nbsp;cm diameter. The [[fruit]] is a thick-skinned edible [[berry (botany)|berry]] 5\u20138&nbsp;cm diameter.\n\n==Varieties==\nA number of [[variety (botany)|varieties]] and [[form (botany)|form]]s have been described:\n* ''Genipa americana'' var. ''americana''\n* ''Genipa americana'' var. ''caruto'' K.Schum.\n* ''Genipa americana'' var. ''riobranquensis'' Kuhlm.\n* ''Genipa americana'' f. ''grandifolia'' Chodat &  Hassl.\n* ''Genipa americana'' f. ''jorgensenii'' Steyerm.\n* ''Genipa americana'' f. ''parvifolia'' Chodat &  Hassl.\n\nThe leaves are a food source for the caterpillars of the Fadus Sphinx Moth (''Aellopos fadus'').\n\n==Uses==\n''Genipa americana'' is cultivated for its edible [[fruit]], which are made into drinks, jelly, [[Sorbet|sherbet]] and used in [[ice cream]]. It is also said to be useful for treatment of [[candiru]] attacks. South American Indians bathe their legs in the clear liquid obtained from the fruit. The liquid has an [[astringent]] effect. When the liquid oxidizes, it stains the skin black. These stains are permanent, but only color the top few layers of skin, and thus disappear after about a fortnight, when the skin is naturally shed. As South Americans Indians went into battle, they used to paint themselves with Genipa juice and [[annatto]].\n\nThe juice of the immature fruit is clear, but induces a chemical reaction on the human skin resulting in a tattoo-like dark blue. Used by rainforest natives as body-painting color. The ripened fruit of Huito is often eaten raw or made into jam.  The fruit is brewed into a tea and taken as a remedy for [[bronchitis]]. Huito prefers alluvial soils, and grows very quickly (producing in 3 years), even in heavily flooded fields. This tree can be planted but more often than not it is dispersed by animals or water. It also serves as a very good climbing tree to reach other trees.\nIn [[Puerto Rico]], the fruit is placed in a glass container, refrigerated and used as a tonic. Folklore states that it contains \"natural glass\".\n\n== Gallery ==\n{{Gallery\n|title=\n|width=160 | height=120 | lines=2\n|align=center\n|footer=\n|File:Genipa americana 1.JPG|A young tree \n|File:Genipa americana.jpg|Flowers\n|File:Genipa americana L. fruits (codiferous).jpg|Detail of a fruit\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commonscat|Genipa americana}}\n{{wikispecies|Genipa americana}}\n* [http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?395 Germplasm Resources Information Network: ''Genipa americana'']\n* [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=GEAM USDA Plants Profile: ''Genipa americana'']\n* [http://www.rainforestconservation.org/data_sheets/agroforestry/Genipa_americana.html Datasheet] from Rainforest Conservation\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Genipa Americana}}\n[[Category:Gardenieae]]\n[[Category:Trees of Brazil]]\n[[Category:Trees of Colombia]]\n[[Category:Trees of Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Trees of Cuba]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ecuador]]\n[[Category:Trees of El Salvador]]\n[[Category:Trees of French Guiana]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guadeloupe]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guyana]]\n[[Category:Trees of Hispaniola]]\n[[Category:Trees of Honduras]]\n[[Category:Trees of Martinique]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Trees of Panama]]\n[[Category:Trees of Paraguay]]\n[[Category:Trees of Peru]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Flora of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]\n[[Category:Trees of Suriname]]\n[[Category:Trees of Venezuela]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1759]]",

These flowers have a bright pink to lilac color that is tinged with white. A pale yellow spot is usually at the flower's base.\n\nThe tree's fruit is a pod about 10 to 15&nbsp;cm long. It is green when unripe and becomes yellow-brown when it reaches maturity. The pod produces 4 to 10 round brown seeds.\n\n''G. sepium'' is native to [[tropical dry forests]] in [[Mexico]] and [[Central America]].

Its high protein content allows it to complement low-quality tropical forages. G. Sepium can tolerate repeated cutting, every 2 to 4 months depending on the climate. Cutting G. Sepium causes it to retain its leaves during the [[dry season]] when many forage crops have lost their leaves. In some cases it is the only source of feed during the dry season.<ref name=\"fao\" />\n\n===Intercropping===\n\n''G. sepium'' trees are used for [[intercropping]] in part because they [[Nitrogen fixing|fix nitrogen]] in the soil and tolerate low soil fertility, so when they are interplanted with crops they can boost crop yields significantly, without the need of chemical fertilizers.\n\nG. Sepium tolerates being cut back to crop height, and can even be [[Coppicing|coppiced]], year after year. When the trees are cut back, they enter a temporary dormant state during which their root systems do not compete for nutrients needed by the crops, so the crops can establish themselves.<ref name=\"InterCropping\">{{cite web| title = Trees 'boost African crop yields and food security' | work = Planting trees to boost crop yields in Africa | publisher = BBC News | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15305271 | format = | doi =| accessdate = 2011-10-16}}</ref>\n\nThese properties also enable G.

Farmers in Latin America often wash their livestock with a paste made of crushed G. sepium leaves to ward off [[torsalo]]s (botflies). In the Philippines, the extract obtained from its leaves is used to remove external parasites.<ref name=\"cornell\" />\n\n==Limitations==\n\n''G. sepium'' seems to be toxic to non-[[ruminants]].\n\nSome [[palatability]] challenges have been reported; animals seem to refuse the leaves on the basis of smell, but this depends on management and geography.<ref name=\"fao.org\">http://www.fao.org/WAICENT/FAOINFO/AGRICULT/AGP/AGPC/doc/Publicat/Gutt-shel/x5556e07.htm</ref>\n\nAnother limitation is frost intolerance and the lack of adaptation to a cool season: it is a tropical plant.\n\nIn terms of cultivation, it requires the presence of [[pollinators]], and it needs a dry season to [[germinate]].\n\nFurther, it has invasive potential: its swift propagation has caused it to be considered a weed in Jamaica.<ref>\"Gliricidia sepium\"[http://www.tropicalforages.info/key/Forages/Media/Html/Gliricidia_sepium.htm].

This flowering plant from the [[Malvaceae]] family grows up to 30m in height and 30\u201340&nbsp;cm in diameter. It is widely found in areas such as the Caribbean, South American, Central America and Mexico serving a number of uses that varies from its value in carpentry to its utility in medicine.\n\n==Common Names==\n*Bengali: nipaltunth\n*English: bastard cedar, bay cedar, pigeon wood, West Indian elm\n*French: Bois de h\u00eatre, Bois d'homme, Bois d'orme\n*Portuguese: bois d'orme, embira, fruta-de-macaco, mutamba, orme d'Am\u00e9rique, poj\u00f3\n*Spanish: bacedar, camb\u00e1-ac\u00e1, coco, contamal, cualote, gu\u00e1cima, Gu\u00e1cima cimaronna, Gu\u00e1cima de caballo, gu\u00e1cimo, guazuma, iumanasi, kamba aka guasa, majagua de toro, papayillo, tablote, tapaculo\n*Tamil: rudrasam, tenbachai, thenmaram, tubakki\n\n==Description==\n\n===Botany===\n[[File:Guazuma ulmifolia 1.jpg|thumb|left|''Guazuma ulmifolia'']]\n''Guazuma ulmifolia'' grows to 30 m in height and 30\u201340&nbsp;cm in diameter and comes with a rounded crown. Leaves are distributed in an alternate pattern with 2 rows in assembled flatly. The leaves are ovate to lance-shaped, finely saw toothed margin, usually have a rough texture and are 6\u201313&nbsp;cm in length and 2.5\u20136&nbsp;cm in diameter. 3-5 main veins arise from the base (rounded or notched, unequal sided) of the leaf which has a darker green upper surface and a fairer green color underneath. They are virtually hairless and thin. The leaf stalks of this species are lean, approximately 6-12mm long, and are covered with small \u201cstar-shaped\u201d hairs.\n\n[[File:Guazuma ulmifolia 2.jpg|thumb|''Guazuma Ulmifolia'' flowers.]]\nThe panicles (indeterminate flower clusters) are in a branched pattern around 2.5\u20135&nbsp;cm in length and are found at the bottom of the leaves. The flowers come in many, are short stalked, small in size, have a brown-yellow color, five parted, 1&nbsp;cm in length and have a small fragrance to them. The calyx contains are lobed (2-3), have hairs that are brown or light grey in color, as well as greenish. They have 5 petals with a yellow-like stamen, 15anthers per pistil, 5 stigmas (combined), ovary lighter green in color with hairs, and also contains a style.  The fruit which have capsules that are round to elliptical in shape are 15-25mm in length. They have many seeds which are shaped like eggs and are 3mm in length, grey in color.\n\n===Propagation===\nThe species itself flowers throughout the year, in particular from April to October.  ''Guazuma ulmifolia'' can be cultivated by either directly planting seeds or cuttings of the plant, as well as root stumps and bare-root seedlings. Before planting the seeds they need to be soaked in boiling water for 30 seconds; the water should be drained afterwards. 7\u201314 days after fresh seeds are planted, germination occurs (60-80% rate).When they reach a height of 30\u201340&nbsp;cm which is usually about 15 weeks later they are then prepared for \u201coutplanting.\u201d When using root stumps as a means for propagation they are left to dwell in a nursery for a period of time until the stem of the diameter reached 1.5-2.5&nbsp;cm, which is usually about 5\u20138 months.\n\n===Pests===\nThe ''Guazuma ulmifolia''  falls prey most commonly to the defoliating insect ''Phelyypera distigma''. It is also faced with other defoliators such as ''[[Arsenura armida]]'' and ''Epitragus'' sp. These defoliators very rarely cause problems, but has been witnessed:  ''Aepytus'' sp, ''Automeris rubrescens'', ''Hylesia lineata'', ''Lirimiris truncata'' and ''Periphoba arcaei''.\n\n==Distribution==\n''Guazuma ulmifolia''  is normally found in the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America and Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil. Places such as India have been cultivating them or more than 100 years. Indonesia has in recent times introduced the species into their territory. \n*They are native to places such as: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Martinique, Mexico, Montserrat, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, Virgin Islands (US)\n*They are considered exotic species to: India, Indonesia\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Guazuma ulmifolia (West Indian Elm) W IMG 8267.jpg|thumb|''Guazuma ulmifolia'' (West Indian Elm)]]\n\n===Wood===\nThe wood of the ''Guazuma ulmifolia''  is utilized for posts, interior carpentry, light construction, boxes, crates, shoe horns, tool handles and charcoal. The wood is found to be very unproblematic to work with. The sapwood has a color of brown (light) and the heartwood is pink to brown.\n\n===Fodder/Food/Shelter===\n''Guazuma ulmifolia''  serves as a very vital source of fodder for livestock approaching the end of the dry season of the native array dry areas. It is the favored tree for fodder in Jamaica.  The trees also serve to bestow shade in pastures. The immature fruits and leaves are given as food to horses and cattle. The fruits are also given to the hogs in Puerto Rico. The leaves and fruits are usually fed to the cattle throughout the arid season. The trees may also serve the purpose of being actual posts surrounding pastures. The seeds are edible raw or cooked\n\n===Medicinal===\nA beverage of crushed seeds soaked in water is used to treat diarrhea, dysentery, colds, coughs, contusions, and venereal disease. It is also used as a diuretic and astringent. <ref>Vallejo, M.A., and F.J. Oveido. 1994.

It is also known as '''Black Lapacho''' ('''lapacho negro'''), or '''tajy'''.\n\nIt grows in the high forest watershed of the [[Paran\u00e1 River]], [[Paraguay River]] and [[Uruguay River]]. It has a limited distribution, almost exclusively inhabiting the low lands with wet and deep soils, where it forms part of the upper stratum. It is very rare in other microenvironments. It is the national tree of Paraguay, declared as such in the N\u00ba4631 Act of May 10, 2012, as proposed by the School of Chemical Sciences at the [[Universidad Nacional de Asunci\u00f3n|National University of Asunci\u00f3n]].\n\n\n==Description==\n\nIt is a very tall tree, growing up to 40 m in height. The leaves are 10-15 cm long, [[:wikt:trifoliate|trifoliate]] with elliptical serrated leaflets. The trunk is long, cylindrical, and stately. The bark is brown-gray, very rough, and with deep cracks in adult specimens. The crown is hemispherical with open fan branches. There is semi-persistent foliage. Its leaves are opposite, palmate, and have 5-7 leaflets. The tree is [[semi-deciduous]] with purple/pink tubular flowers appearing before the leaves. The flowers can vary in color from bright pink to pale pink or even white. The fruit is a linear pod up to 30-40 cm long and 1-1.5 cm wide, brown when ripe, opening longitudinally into two leaflets and dropping some 150 winged seeds.\n\nFlowering begins in the first half of September; approximately 30 days after the first leaves appear, with the seed pods ripening in January-February.\n\nThe tree is very decorative, and is frequently used in parks, squares and public woodland. It withstands high winds and has a strong and deep root system.\n\nThe tree is very demanding in terms of light and humidity, and is susceptible to frost when young. It prefers light, deep, moist soil.\n\n==Properties==\n\nThe wood is hard and heavy, with well-marked differences between sapwood and heartwood timber. The heartwood turns a dark color with oxidation. The wood is very weatherproof. It is used in the construction of boats, docks, truck beds, beams, crosspieces, stairs, floors, as well as woodturning. Sawing produces a pale yellow sawdust containing [[lapachol]]. The wood has [[tannins]] and dyes.\n\nThe sawdust or wood chips, bark and leaves can be used for medicinal purposes.\n\nThe tree is easily propagated by seeds. The number of seeds/kg is 32,000 to 35,000. Planting should be done as quickly as possible, as the seeds will only germinate during the first 12-15 days. [[Vegetative reproduction|Vegetative propagation]] through the [[rootstock]] is also possible. In this species, certain trees produce white flowers. These \"white lapachos\" are often reproduced by grafting.\n\n==References==\n{{commons category}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n* L\u00f3pez, J.A; Little, E; Ritz, G; Rombold, J; Hahn, W. 1987. \u00c1rboles comunes del Paraguay: \u00d1ande yvyra mata kuera.

Lapacho is the national tree of [[Paraguay]],<ref>[http://homeguides.sfgate.com/lapacho-tree-48569.html]</ref> and it is also a common tree in Argentina's northeastern region, as well as in southeastern [[Bolivia]].  According to ''Native Trees of Trinidad and Tobago'', this tree is not indigenous to Trinidad, it is introduced.\n\nIt is a conspicuous and well-known species with a long history of human use. Consequently, it has a range of local names: ''ip\u00ea-cavat\u00e3, ip\u00ea-comum, ip\u00ea-reto, ip\u00ea-rosa, ip\u00ea-roxo-damata, lapacho negro, pau d'arco-roxo, pe\u00fava'' or ''pi\u00fava''. The [[timber]] is sometimes traded as \"[[Brazilwood]]\", which properly refers to the unrelated Pernambuco tree (''[[Caesalpinia echinata]]'').\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Tabebuia impetiginosa hojas.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|Foliage]]\n[[Image:Tabebuia impetiginosa inflorescencia.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|[[Inflorescence]]s]]\n[[Image:Tabebuia impetiginosa flower.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A single flower]]\n\nThe pink lapacho is a rather large [[deciduous]] tree, with trunks sometimes reaching 8 dm width and 30 m height. Usually a third of that height is trunk, and two thirds are its longer branches. It has a large, globous, but often sparse [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]]. The tree has a slow growth rate. Leaves are opposite and [[Petiole (botany)|petiolate]], 2 to 3&nbsp;inches long, elliptic and [[lanceolate]], with lightly serrated margins and pinnate [[Leaf#Venation (arrangement of the veins)|venation]]. The leaves are palmately compound with usually 5 leaflets.\n\nIts bark is brownish grey, tough and hard to peel. The wood is of a pleasant yellowish colour, barely knotted and very tough and heavy (0,935&nbsp;kg/dm\u00b3). It's rich in [[tannin]]s and therefore very resistant to weather and sun.<ref name = lopezetal1987>L\u00f3pez ''et al.'' (1987)</ref> It is not very useful for furniture since it is so hard to work by hand. It can be found as beams or fulfilling other structural uses where needed outdoors.\n\nIn the southern hemisphere, pink lapacho flowers between July and September, before the new leaves appear. In the northern hemisphere like [[India]], the flowering season is December to January, after the leaves are shed. The flower is large, tubular shaped, its corolla is often pink or magenta, though exceptionally seen white, about 2&nbsp;inches long. There are four [[stamens]] and a [[staminode]]. The fruit consists of a narrow dehiscent [[Capsule (fruit)|capsule]] containing several winged seeds.\n\nThe flowers are easily accessible to [[pollinator]]s. Some [[hummingbird]]s - e.g. [[black jacobin]] (''Florisuga fusca'') and [[black-throated mango]] (''Anthracothorax nigricollis'') - seem to prefer them over the flowers of other ''[[Handroanthus]]'' species, while for others like the [[stripe-breasted starthroat]] (''Heliomaster squamosus'') it may even be a mainstay food source.<ref>Baza Mendon\u00e7a & dos Anjos (2005)</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n\nHarvest of wild ''Handroanthus impetiginosus'' for lumber to make flooring and decking (in which case it is referred to as ip\u00ea in much of the timber trade) has become a major cause of [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation in the Amazon]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Schulze M, Grogan J, Landis RM, Vidal E | title = How rare is too rare to harvest?

[[Swietenia mahagoni]] and [[Swietenia humilis]] (other species yielding mahogany wood) were so thoroughly depleted that by the early 1900s there were essentially none left to harvest in the wild. Unfortunately the current scenario is one in which ''Handroanthus'' is headed for similar unsustainable depletion of wild populations.\n\n==Uses==\n[[Image:Lapacho Teerinde.JPG|thumb|left|[[Lapacho]] tea]]\n''Handroanthus impetiginosus'', as well as other species of this genus, are trees naturally found in the wild of central to South American forests. It is also used as a [[honey plant]], and widely planted as [[ornamental tree]] in landscaping gardens, public squares and boulevards due to its impressive and colorful appearance as it flowers.<ref name=lopezetal1987/> Well-known and popular, it is the [[Floral emblem|national tree]] of Paraguay. It is also planted as a street tree in cities of India, like in Bangalore.\n\nThe inner [[bark]] of ''Handroanthus impetiginosus'' is used in [[traditional medicine]].<ref>[http://www.esalq.usp.br/trilhas/medicina/am21.htm?PHPSESSID=82bf340b6b369121eea5b3aeefd6eef5 ''Tabebuia avellanedae''] at [[University of S\u00e3o Paulo]]</ref> It is dried, shredded, and then boiled, making a bitter brownish-colored tea known as [[lapacho]] or taheebo. The unpleasant taste of the extract is lessened when taken in pill form, or as [[tincture]]s. Lapacho bark is typically used during flu and cold season and for easing [[smoker's cough]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} It apparently works by promoting the lungs to expectorate and free deeply embedded mucus and contaminates during the first three to ten days of treatment.<ref name = lopezetal1987 />{{medcn|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn [[ethnomedicine]], lapacho plays an important role for several South American indigenous peoples. In the past decades it has been used by [[herbalist]]s as a general [[Pharmaceutical drug|tonic]], [[immunostimulant]],<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wagner H. |author2=Seitz R. | title = Lapacho (''Tabebuia impetiginosa'') - Portrait of a medicinal plant from the Southamerican rainforest | journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Phytotherapie | year = 1998 | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 226\u2013238}}</ref> and [[adaptogen]].

        "text": "{{speciesbox\n|name = Ilama\n|image = Annona diversifolia.jpg\n|genus = Annona\n|species = diversifolia\n|authority = [[Saff.]]\n}}\n\nThe '''ilama''' (also known as '''the tree of the ilama''', ''Annona diversifolia'') is a [[tropical]] [[fruit]] [[tree]] found in [[Central America]].  The name is derived from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] from the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] ''ilamatzapotl'', of which the rough translation is \"old woman's ''[[sapote]]''\".  The name is also applied to a similar fruit, ''soncoya'' or ''cabeza de negro''  (''A. pupurea''), which is cultivated as an alternative to the [[cherimoya]].  The ''soncoya'' is similar in size to the ilama, but grey-brown in color with hard bumps on the surface, and orange flesh that tastes like [[mango]] or [[Paw-paw|pawpaw]].\n\nThe ilama fruit is either eaten on the half-shell or scooped out with a tool, usually chilled when served. It is sometimes served with a little cream and sugar to intensify the flavor, or with a drop of [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] or [[lemon]] juice to bring in a tart and bitter tinge.\n\n==Fruit==\nThe ilama fruit is either cone-shaped, heart-shaped, or ovular.  Resembling the [[cherimoya]],  it is about six inches (15 cm) long and may weigh as much as two pounds (900 g).  Generally, the ilama is dotted with more-or-less pronounced, triangular [[Spike (botany)|spikes]] that jut out of the fruit, though some fruits on the same tree may vary from rough to fairly smooth.\n\nThere are two types of ilama, green and pink.  The green type has a flesh that is white and sweet, while in the pink type, the flesh is a rose color and has a tart taste.\n\nThe [[Peel (fruit)|rind]], or skin, of the ilama varies from a pale-green color to a deep-pink or purplish color coated with a thick mat of velvety, gray-white bloom.  It is about 1/4 inch thick (6 mm), leathery, fairly soft, and granular.\n\nThe center of both ilamas are somewhat fibrous, but smooth and custardy near the rind.  The flesh varies from being dry to being fairly juicy, and contains 25 to 80 hard, smooth, brown, cylindrical seeds, about 3/4 inch (2 cm) long, and 3/8 inch (1 cm) wide. Each seed is enclosed in a close-fitting membrane that, when split, slides right off of the seed.\n\n==Tree==\nThe tree that produces the ilama stands erect at about 25 feet (7.5m), and often the branches begin at ground level.  The tree is distinguished by its aromatic, pale-brownish-grey, furrowed bark and glossy, thin, elliptic to [[obovate]] or [[oblanceolate]] leaves, two to six inches (5-15cm) long.  Clasping the base of the flowering branchlets are one or two leaf-like, nearly circular, glabrous [[bract]]s, about 1 to 1-3/8 inches (2.5 - 3.5cm) in length.  New growth from the tree is a reddish or coppery color.  The flowers of the ilama tree are long and solitary.  They are maroon flowers, which open to the base, and have small, rusty, hairy [[sepal]]s, narrow, blunt, minutely hairy outer [[petal]]s, and [[stamen]]-like, [[pollen]]-bearing inner petals.\n\n===Cultivation===\nFruit harvest of the ilama tree occurs in late June in Mexico, and only lasts about two weeks. In Guatemala, the harvest season extends from late July to September, and from July to December where the ilama is cultivated in [[Florida]].\n\nAccording to tradition, the fruits are not to be picked until cracking occurs, but they can be picked a little earlier and held up to three days for softening to take place. If the ilama is picked too early, it will never ripen. The yield of the ilama is typically low. During the normal fruiting period, some trees will have no fruits; others only three to 10, while exceptional trees may bear as many as 85 to 100 fruits per season.\n\n==History==\n[[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de Toledo|Francisco Hernandez]] was one of the first people to document the ilama.  He was sent by [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II]] of [[Spain]] in 1570 to take note of the useful products of [[Mexico]].  For many years, people confused it with the [[soursop]] or the [[custard apple]].\n\nThe ilama is native and grows wild in the foothills of the southwest coast of Mexico and of the [[Pacific]] coast of [[Guatemala]] and [[El Salvador]].  It is strictly a [[tropical plant]]. It does not grow naturally higher than 2,000 feet (610 m) in Mexico; although in El Salvador it is cultivated at 5,000 feet (1,524 m), and in [[Guatemala]], it is cultivated up to 5,900 feet (1,800 m). The ilama survives best in climates where there is a long dry season followed by plentiful rainfall. The tree is irrigated in areas where rainfall does not fall periodically.\n\n==Nutrition==\n\nAccording to analyses made in El Salvador, the [[food value]] per 100 g of edible portion of the fruit is as follows:\n\n* [[Moisture]], 71.5 g\n* [[Protein]], 0.447 g\n* [[Fat]], 0.16 g\n* [[Fiber]], 1.3 g\n* [[Ash (analytical chemistry)|Ash]], 1.37 g\n* [[Calcium]], 31.6 mg\n* [[Phosphorus]], 51.7 mg\n* [[Iron]], 0.70 mg\n* [[Carotene]], 0.011 mg\n* [[Thiamine]], 0.235 mg\n* [[Riboflavin]], 0.297 mg\n* [[Niacin]], 2.177 mg\n* [[Ascorbic Acid]], 13.6 mg\n\n==Trivia==\n\nThe ilama fruit was used as a [[plot device]] in the 1997 [[Malayalam cinema|Malayalam film]], [[Guru (1997 film)|Guru]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mouthshut.com/review/-review-lrtsnqtsmm |title=GURU - MALAYALAM MOVIE - Review, Trailer, Movie, Actress, Wallpapers, Aam Aadmi Learns The Parable Of ilama Fruit :-) |publisher=MouthShut.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-10}}</ref><ref>http://ipsnews2.wpengine.com/1998/01/cinema-india-oscar-entry-offers-spiritual-solution-to-conflict/</ref> directed by [[Rajiv Anchal|Rajeev Anchal]].

The [[flower]]s are produced in conspicuous large [[panicle]]s, each flower with a five-lobed blue to purple-blue [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]]; a few species have white flowers. The [[fruit]] is an oblong to oval flattened [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]] containing numerous slender [[seed]]s. The genus differs from other genera in the Bignoniaceae in having a [[staminode]] that is longer than the [[stamen]]s, tricolpate [[pollen]], and a [[chromosome]] number of 18. This genus thrives in full sun and sandy soils, which explains their abundance in warmer climates. Mature plants can survive in colder climates down to {{convert|-7|C|F}}, however, they may not bloom as profusely. Younger plants are more fragile and may not survive in colder climates when temperatures drop below freezing, so planting of younger trees in pots and moving them into a greenhouse for winter is recommended.\n\n==Genus==\nThe genus is divided into two sections, sect. ''Jacaranda'' (syn. sect. ''Monolobos'', an invalid name as it includes the type species of the genus, ''J. caerulea'') and sect. ''Dilobos'' DC., based on the number of [[theca]]e on the [[anther]]s. Sect. ''Jacaranda'' (which includes Blue Jacarandas) has 18 species and is found primarily in Zimbabwe, in North, West and East of [[Iran]], western [[South America]], [[Central America]], [[Mexico]], and the [[Caribbean]]. Sect. ''Dilobos'', which is believed to be the primitive form, has 31 species and is found primarily in southeastern [[Brazil]] including the [[Paran\u00e1 River]] valley. The anatomy of the [[wood]] in the two sections also differs. Although usually treated in sect. ''Jacaranda'', ''J. copaia'' differs somewhat from all other members of the genus, and may be intermediate between the two sections (Dos Santos & Miller 1997).\n\n==Selected species==\n[[Image:Jacaranda ulei flower.jpg|thumb|Flowers of ''Jacaranda ulei''.]]\n[[File:Jacaranda macrantha.jpg|thumb|Flowers of ''Jacaranda macrantha''.]]\n{|\n|- valign=top\n|\n;Sect.

Plants occasionally present hermaphroditic flowers.<ref name=\"Nahar\"/> \n* [[Fruit]]s : fruits are produced in winter, or there may be several crops during the year if soil moisture is good and temperatures are sufficiently high. Most fruit production is concentrated from midsummer to late fall with variations in production peaks where some plants have two or three harvests and some produce continuously through the season.<ref name=\"Nahar\" />\n* [[Seed]]s:  the seeds are mature when the capsule changes from green to yellow.  The seeds contain around 20% saturated fatty acids and 80% unsaturated fatty acids, and they yield 25%\u201340% oil by weight. In addition, the seeds contain other chemical compounds, such as [[saccharose]], [[raffinose]], [[stachyose]], [[glucose]], [[fructose]], [[galactose]], and [[protein]]. The oil is largely made up of oleic and [[Linoleic acid|linoleic]] acids.

''Jatropha curcas'' grows in [[Tropics|tropical]] and [[Subtropics|subtropical]] regions.<ref>http://www.agricultureinformation.com/forums/sale/19166-jatropha-curcas-seeds-seedlings-sale.html Warm climate reference</ref>  The plant can grow in [[:wikt:wasteland|wasteland]]s and grows on almost any terrain, even on [[wikt:gravelly|gravelly]], [[sand]]y and [[soil salinity|saline]] [[soil]]s. It can thrive in poor and stony soils, although new research suggests that the plant's ability to adapt to these poor soils is not as extensive as had been previously stated. Complete [[germination]] is achieved within 9 days. Adding [[manure]] during the germination has negative effects during that phase, but is favorable if applied after germination is achieved. It can be propagated by cuttings, which yields faster results than multiplication by seeds.\n\nThe flowers only develop terminally (at the end of a stem), so a good ramification (plants presenting many branches) produces the greatest amount of fruits.

[[Ploughing]] and planting are not needed regularly, as this shrub has a life expectancy of approximately forty years. The use of [[pesticide]]s is not necessary, due to the pesticidal and [[Fungicide|fungicidal]] properties of the plant. It is used in rural Bengal for [[Tinea cruris|dhobi itch]] (a common fungal infection of the skin).\n\nWhile ''Jatropha curcas'' starts yielding from 9-12 months time, the best yields are obtained only after 2\u20133 years time. The seed production is around 3.5 tons per hectare (seed production ranges from about 0.4 t/ha in the first year to over 5 t/ha after 3 years). If planted in [[hedge]]s, the reported productivity of ''Jatropha'' is from 0.8 to 1.0&nbsp;kg of seed per meter of live fence.{{cn|date=April 2015}}\n\n== Propagation ==\n''Jatropha curcas'' has limited natural vegetative propagation and is usually propagated by [[seed]]. Propagation through seed (sexual propagation) leads to a lot of genetic variability in terms of growth, biomass, seed yield and oil content. Low seed viability and the recalcitrant nature of oil seeds also limit seed propagation. However, clonal techniques can help in overcoming these problems that hinder mass propagation of this tree-borne oilseed species. Vegetative propagation has been achieved by [[stem cuttings]], [[grafting]], [[budding]] as well as by [[air layering]] techniques.<ref>Gadekar Kumarsukhadeo Prakash.

The fats and oils are turned into esters while separating the [[glycerin]]. At the end of the process, the glycerin settles and the biofuel floats. The process through which the glycerin is separated from the biodiesel is known as [[transesterification]]. Glycerin is another by-product from Jatropha oil processing that can add value to the crop. Transesterification is a simple chemical reaction that neutralizes the free fatty acids present in any fatty substances in Jatropha. A chemical exchange takes place between the [[alkoxy]] groups of an ester compound by an alcohol. Usually, [[methanol]] and [[ethanol]] are used for the purpose. The reaction occurs by the presence of a [[catalyst]], usually sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or caustic soda and potassium hydroxide (KOH), which forms fatty esters (e.g., methyl or ethyl esters), commonly known as [[biodiesel]].

The long branches bear twigs tipped with 40\u201350&nbsp;cm long, glabrous, pinately compound leaves, darker on the top than on the bottom.  The base of the trunk sometimes has buttresses.\n\n==Habitat==\n''Juglans olanchana'' grows in wet and very wet tropical forests, most frequently on river banks, observed from 0\u20131400 m above sea level.  Reports that it also grows in the mountainous regions of Argentina may result from confusion with the '''cedro negro''' or '''nogal''' (''[[Andean Walnut|J.&nbsp;neotropica]]'')\n\n==Economic importance==\n\n===Timber===\n''J. olanchana'' has a cylindrical, straight shaft that is free of branches for 5\u201315 m.  The moderately heavy (420\u2013450&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>) and moderately durable heartwood has a dark coffee color, is easy to work, and takes an excellent finish.  It is used for light construction, cabinetmaking, parquet floors, luxurious furniture, turnery, musical instruments, and veneer.\n\n===Fruit===\nThe nuts are edible.

In Ray's ''Historia Plantarum'' (1686) it is called ''Styrax liquida''. However, the first mention of any use of the amber is described by Juan de Grijalva, the nephew of the Govorner of Cuba, in the year 1517.\nJuan de Grijalva tells of gift exchanges with the Mayas \"who presented them with, among other things, hollow reeds of about a span long filled with dried herbs and sweet-smelling liquid amber which, when lighted in the way shown by the natives, diffused an agreeable odour.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Corti|first1=Count|title=A History of Smoking|date=1931|publisher=George G.

The species also occurs in [[Mexico]] from southern [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]] south to [[Chiapas]], as well as in [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]] and also in southern [[Brazil]]. In Mexico and [[Central America]], it is a characteristic plant of [[cloud forests]], growing at middle elevations in various mountainous areas where the climate is humid and more temperate.<ref name=Grimm />\n\nThe US government distribution maps for this species are incorrect concerning the southern limit of distribution in Florida.

When the fruit opens and the seeds are released, each capsule is associated with a small hole (40-60 of these) in the compound fruit.\n\nFallen, opened fruits are often abundant beneath the trees; these have been popularly nicknamed<!--PLEASE support nicknames with a valid reference; unsourced names will be deleted--> \"burr (or bir) balls\",<ref name=\"Cal Poly\" /> \"gum balls\",<ref>[http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/c116/liquidambar-styraciflua.aspx Missouri Botanical Garden: ''Liquidambar styraciflua'']</ref> \"space bugs\", \"monkey balls\", \"bommyknockers\", \"sticker balls\",<ref>[http://www.usna.usda.gov/PhotoGallery/AnswerGallery/ImageAnswer_110308.html US National Arboretum]</ref> or \"goblin bombs\".\n\nThe fruit is a multicapsular spherical head and hangs on the branches during the winter.

The long-persisting fallen spiked fruits can be unpleasant to walk on;  sweet gum is banned in some places for this reason.<ref name=\"Cal Poly\" />  In abundance, they can leave a lawn lumpy.

Its wood is bright reddish brown (with the sapwood nearly white) and may have black grain in the heartwood; it is heavy, straight, satiny, and close-grained, but not strong. It takes a beautiful polish, but warps badly in drying.  The wood has a [[specific gravity]] of 0.5910. It is too liable to decay for outdoor use.<ref name=Keeler /><br />\nIn the carpentry industry, the timber is referred to as satin walnut<ref name=Firefly>{{cite book|last=Cafferty|first=Steve|title=Firefly Encyclopedia of Trees|year=2005|publisher=Firefly|location=Buffalo, NY|pages=116\u2013117}}</ref>  and is one of the most important materials for plywood manufacturers.

The [[wood]] is very compact and fine-grained, the [[heartwood]] being reddish, and, when cut into planks, marked transversely with blackish belts. Sweetgum is used principally for lumber, veneer, plywood, slack cooperage, fuel, and pulpwood. The lumber is made into boxes and crates, furniture, cabinets for radios, televisions, and phonographs, interior trim, and [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]]. The veneer and plywood, (typically backed with some other kind of wood which shrinks and warps less) are used for boxes, pallets, crates, baskets, and interior woodwork.  It was formerly used in the interior finish of [[railroad]] [[sleeping car]]s. Being readily dyed black, it is sometimes substituted for [[ebony]] for such uses as inexpensive [[picture frames]].<ref name=Keeler /><ref>Kormanik, Paul P.

Limber and Cash reported that leaf spots produced by this pathogen on several different genera of forest trees were 2\u20135&nbsp;mm diameter with regular margins. During the summer of 1994 in the Nacogdoches County area of Texas, a prominent leaf spot on Sweet Gum was widespread. Infected leaves had numerous necrotic lesions, each surrounded by a reddish halo. The lesions tended to merge resulting in large areas of dead tissue. Infection and fungal development of ''D.&nbsp;dryina'' were investigated on leaves of sweet gum using a combination of microscopic techniques. ''D.&nbsp;dryina'' infection on Sweet Gum has been associated with the disease red leaf spot. Results of this investigation indicate that ''D.&nbsp;dryina'' can penetrate leaf tissue directly, thus having the ability to initiate infection on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. In other regions of the U.S., Sweet Gum populations may not be as susceptible to local populations of this fungus. Environmental stress factors may also be involved, as reports have indicated that herbicide application and [[chlorosis]] caused by iron deficiency may increase susceptibility of ''[[Dicarpella dryina]]''. [[Tannin]]s (a type of biomolecule found in trees to protect it from fire, insects, and bacteria) have been reported to occur in healthy tissue of a variety of plants including sweet gum. They may prevent pathogen invasion by inhibiting fungal enzyme activity. Although cells of healthy sweet gum tissue appear rich in tannins, these materials apparently were not effective in preventing fungal colonization by ''D.&nbsp;dryina''.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Josephine|author2=Shane Clark |title=Infection and Fungal Development of ''Dicarpella dryina'' on Sweet Gum (''Liquidambar styraciflua'')|journal=Mycologia|date=July\u2013August 1996|volume=88|series=Search Wise|issue=4|pages=613\u2013618|<!-- accessdate=17 September 2012 -->|doi=10.2307/3761156}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n* {{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Liquidambar |species=styraciflua }}\n* {{eFloras|1|220007687|Liquidambar styraciflua}}\n{{1728}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|Liquidambar styraciflua}}{{wikispecies}}\n* {{PLANTS |symbol=LIQUI |name=Liquidambar styraciflua}}\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/liquidambar-styraciflua-sweetgum-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map for ''Liquidambar styraciflua'']\n* [http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Liquidambar+styraciflua University of Michigan - Dearborn: Native American Ethnobotany of  ''Liquidambar styraciflua'']\n* [http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/data/atlas/little/liqustyr.pdf USGS Species Distribution Maps: ''Liquidambar styraciflua''] (pdf file).\n* [http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/list2.htm Bioimages.vanderbilt.edu: ''Liquidambar styraciflua'' images]\n* [http://landscaping.about.com/od/fallfoliagetrees/p/sweetgum_trees.htm Landscaping.about.com: American Sweetgum Trees]\n* {{IUCN2006|assessor=Americas Regional Workshop (Conservation|assessor2=Sustainable Management of Trees, Costa Rica, November 1996)|last-assessor-amp=yes|year=1998|id=33966|title=Liquidambar styraciflua|downloaded=12 May 2006}}\n <!-- Most of Florida, as opposed to the continental trees of \"Trees of Northern Florida\" -->\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Altingiaceae]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Southern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of Belize]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Trees of Honduras]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Trees of Chiapas]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Hidalgo (state)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puebla]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Veracruz]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Least concern plants]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

It tends to be low branching, or tending to branch off from the base when in more open areas with greater sun exposure.<ref name=cb/>\n\n=== Leaves and bark ===\nThe glossy, glabrous [[leaf|leaves]] are 12 x 5&nbsp;cm in length, simple, alternate, elliptic, entire, apiculate, acute and lanceolate with prominent [[stipule]]s, a scar encircling each leaf's [[petiole (botany)|petiole]]. The [[bark]] is smooth, reddish brown with a gray cast.<ref name=cb/>\n\n=== Flowers ===\n[[Flower]]s bloom from the months of November through July, peaking in February, March and April. They are bisexual, 10&nbsp;cm in diameter, with 6 spatulate, white [[petal]]s and 3 gray membranous [[sepal]]s. A [[perianth]] is formed of a yellowish white corolla.<ref name=cb/>\n\n=== Fruit and seeds ===\nThe tree bears its [[fruit]], which are aromatic, cone-like, aggregate infructescenses, about 4&nbsp;cm in length, in July and August. There are approximately 25 fruits of dehiscing capsules per infructescense. The fruit's [[seed]]s are exserted, and covered with bright networks of [[aril]]s which dangle from threads. [[Seed germination]] is [[epigeal germination|epigean]].<ref name=cb/>\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\nMostly located in [[foothills]] of the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]] and [[Cordillera Central, Costa Rica|Central]], ''M. poasana'' has been documented as growing naturally as low as 500m, and as high as 2400m, but most trees have been found at elevations between 1300m to 2200m.<ref name=cb/><ref name=trop>{{ cite web |url=http://tropicos.org/NameSpecimens.aspx?nameid=19300143 |title=''Magnolia poasana'' (Pittier) Dandy: specimens |work=Tropicos |publisher=[[Missouri Botanical Garden]] |location=[[St. Louis, Missouri]] |accessdate=December 8, 2009}}</ref>\nAll specimens of ''M. poasana'' prior to 1972 were collected from Costa Rica, but since then samples have been collected in [[Chiapas|Chiapas, Mexico]]; in 1982 samples were also collected in Panama.<ref name=trop/>\n''M. poasana'' is most often found growing in [[soil]]s of [[alluvium|alluvial]] or [[Andisols|volcanic]] origin, in [[climate]]s in which the temperature ranges between 4 and 25 degrees C; where the [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] accumulates at rates of 2,000 to 3,000&nbsp;mm per annum.<ref name=cb/>\n\n== Uses ==\nThe Poas magnolia has applications in [[construction]] and [[Wood carving|carving]].\n\nThe [[wood]] is colored greenish-grey with an oven-dry [[specific weight]] of 0.38.<ref name=merker>{{ cite book |author=C.A.

It is native to [[Mexico]] and [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?409651 |title=Miconia calvescens |work=[[Germplasm Resources Information Network]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |date=1997-12-10 |accessdate=2009-02-07}}</ref> and it has become one of the world's most [[invasive species]].\n\nMiconia trees can flower several times a year and bear fruit simultaneously. The [[inflorescence]]s are large [[panicle]]s of white to light pink blossoms. The tiny purple fruits are about half a centimeter in diameter and packed with about 120\u2013230 minuscule seeds. The sweet fruits are attractive to birds and other animals which disperse the seeds. A young tree with only two flower panicles can produce {{formatnum:200000}} seeds in its first fruiting season. This heavy seed production and potential for long-distance dispersal help make miconia an invasive threat. The seeds can lie dormant in the soil of the forest for more than 12 years, and whenever a break in the canopy allows sun to shine through to a patch of soil the seeds there undergo germination. Once the plants grow to full height, their enormous leaves shade out all the space below them, preventing any other plant from growing nearby. It also has a shallow root system that facilitates soil [[erosion]].<ref>Lalith Gunasekera, ''Invasive Plants: A guide to the identification of the most invasive plants of Sri Lanka'', Colombo 2009, p. 103\u2013104.</ref>\n\nThe tree can grow to a height of {{convert|15|m|ft}} and has very large leaves, each up to {{convert|1|m|ft}} in length. Its purple and green leaves with flashy white veining made it attractive as an [[ornamental plant|ornamental]], and it was imported to Hawaii and other new areas in the mid-twentieth century.\n\n==Invasive species==\nThe [[Invasive Species Specialist Group]] list the tree as one of the world's 100 most invasive species in the Global Invasive Species Database.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.issg.org/database/species/search.asp?st=100ss|title=100 of the World's Worst Invasive Alien Species|publisher=Global Invasive Species Database|accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe seeds are dispersed from gardens into natural forest habitats by fruit-eating birds. Once dispersed into [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist forests]] it takes hold vigorously, invading any spot in the [[understory]] that receives patches of sunlight, and becomes a [[weed|noxious weed]]. \n\nIt is known for being the worst invasive plant in [[Hawaii]], where it is commonly referred to as the \"purple plague\", and threatens to destroy entire [[ecosystem]]s. \nHawaiian populations of miconia were first discovered in the 1990s, and since the plant's invasive potential was already well-known, control and eradication efforts began immediately. Uprooting and herbicides are used to remove plants, but [[biological control]] has not yet met with great success. Teams of volunteers often lead expeditions into the forest to remove miconia plants by hand.\n\nThe tree has become an invasive species in Tahiti and a quarter of the rainforest on the island is now made up of miconia stands.  For this reason, it is frequently called the \"green [[cancer]]\" on the island. \n\nIn Sri Lanka it invades upcountry mountain forest areas. It forms monospecific stands that shade out native vegetation.<ref>Lalith Gunasekera, ''Invasive Plants: A guide to the identification of the most invasive plants of Sri Lanka'', Colombo 2009, p. 103\u2013104.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.hear.org/species/miconia_calvescens ''Miconia calvescens'' information and links] from the [[Hawaiian Ecosystems at Risk project]]\n*[http://www.hear.org/species/miconia_calvescens/ ''Miconia calvescens'' detailed information and references] from the [http://www.hear.org/pier/ Pacific Ecosystems at Risk project]\n*[http://www.hear.org/starr/hiplants/images/thumbnails/html/miconia_calvescens.htm ''Miconia calvescens'' images]: a gallery of copyright-free high-resolution photographs\n*[http://www.comfsm.fm/~dleeling/invasive/miconia.html ''Miconia calvescens'']\n\n[[Category:Miconia|calvescens]]\n[[Category:Flora of Central America]]\n[[Category:Flora of South America]]\n[[Category:Trees of Bolivia]]\n[[Category:Trees of Brazil]]\n[[Category:Trees of Colombia]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ecuador]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Panama]]\n[[Category:Trees of Paraguay]]\n[[Category:Trees of Peru]]\n[[Category:Invasive plant species]]\n[[Category:Invasive plant species in Sri Lanka]]",

It has serrated [[leaf|leaves]] 2.5\u201315&nbsp;cm long and 1\u20136.5&nbsp;cm wide. The [[flower]]s are small, white, and slightly malodorous. It gives rise to 1.0- to 1.5-cm light red [[fruit]]. The fruit is edible, sweet, and juicy, and contains a large number of tiny (0.5-mm) yellow [[seed]]s.\n\nIt is a [[pioneer species]] that thrives in poor soil, able to tolerate acidic and alkaline conditions and drought. Its seeds are dispersed by birds and fruit bats. It is cultivated for its edible fruit, and has become [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]] in some other parts of the tropics, including southeastern [[Asia]]. As a [[pioneer plant]], it could help condition the soil and make it habitable to other plants. However, it might also be considered as an [[invasive species]] since it might outcompete indigenous plants.\n\n==Uses==\nIn [[Mexico]], the fruits are eaten and sold in markets. The fruits can be processed into jams and the leaves can be used for making tea. In [[Brazil]], the trees are planted along river banks. The fruits falling from the tree attract fish that are then caught. In the [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], the fruits are usually eaten mostly by children, although they are not sold in the markets. The skin is slightly tough and often discarded by children.\n\nIn [[traditional medicine]], its leaves can be used as an [[antiseptic]] or antipruritic and to treat abdominal cramps.\n\nThe timber from what is also known as the Jamaican cherry is reddish brown. It is compact, durable, and lightweight and can be used for carpentry. It could also be used as firewood. The bark can be used to produce ropes and fiber for bark skirts. Due to its ability to grow in poor soil and its effective propagation by means of bats and birds, it could be used for [[reforestation]] projects.\n\nIn India, it is used in urban gardens for its ability to grow fast and attractiveness to small fruit-eating birds such as the [[flowerpecker]]s. It is also commonly planted in parking lots.\n\nAnother study claimed that ''aratilis'' leaves possess antinociceptive (reducing sensitivity to pain), anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and antipruritic properties, justifying the folkloric medicinal use.\n\n==Habitat==\nIn the Philippines, the trees are commonly visited by different species of birds. It also attracts bats and nocturnal animals that feasts on the sweet juice of the fruit. This aides for the fast widespread propagation of the muntingia in the Philippine forests which sometimes overpopulate an area  in just a couple of years.\nWith just enough sun and water, it grows with little or no care. This is apparent in the island of Maldives, where'' Muntingia'', locally known as ''jeymu'' grows without any care in very salty sand.\nThe Malaysian common name ''ceri kampung'' means \"village cherry\". In Malaysia the muntingia tree is found in many urban areas lining the sides of streets in front of rows of houses. There, the ''Muntingia'' produces great quantities of fruit. \n\n===Growing===\nThis is a fast-growing fruit tree, 2 years to be a 3-m tree. After the flowers are pollinated, the berries are fast-growing. Once they ripen, the flowers start to bloom again. After one crop of berries is harvested, the plant continues to flower and produce fruit. The fruit tree will grow for many years.\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Muntingia calabura (2).JPG|A fruit.\nImage:Common Emigrant (Catopsilia pomona) on Singapur cherry (Muntingia calabura) W IMG 9605.jpg|Common emigrant ''[[Catopsilia pomona]]'' on its flower in Hyderabad\nImage:Singapur cherry Muntingia calabura trunk in Secunderabad, AP W IMG 6649.jpg|Trunk in Hyderabad \nImage:Singapur cherry Muntingia calabura leaves & flowers in Secunderabad, AP W IMG 6645.jpg|Leaves and flowers in Hyderabad\nImage:Singapur cherry Muntingia calabura leaves & flowers in Secunderabad, AP W IMG 6644.jpg|Leaves and flowers in Hyderabad\nImage:Common Jay (Graphium doson) on Singapur Cherry (Muntingia calabura) W IMG 9602.jpg|Common jay ''[[Graphium doson]]'' on its flower in Hyderabad\nFile:Muntingia calabura 8406.JPG|''Muntingia calabura ''flower\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References and external links==\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=MUCA4 USDA Plants Profile: ''Muntingia calabura'']\n*[http://www.stuartxchange.org/Aratiles.html Aratiles]\n*[http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/plants/cherry_tree.htm Jamaican Cherry Tree]\n*[http://www.hear.org/Pier/species/muntingia_calabura.htm Pacific Island Ecosystems: ''Muntingia calabura'']\n*[http://www.jstor.org/pss/4252085 Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss: The use of wild plants in tropical South America]\n\n[[Category:Monotypic Malvales genera]]\n[[Category:Trees of Hispaniola]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Bahamas]]\n[[Category:Trees of Belize]]\n[[Category:Trees of Bolivia]]\n[[Category:Trees of Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Trees of Cuba]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ecuador]]\n[[Category:Trees of El Salvador]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Trees of Honduras]]\n[[Category:Trees of Jamaica]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Trees of Panama]]\n[[Category:Trees of Peru]]\n[[Category:Trees of Trinidad and Tobago]]",

It is known by the common names '''Malabar chestnut''', '''French peanut''', '''Guiana chestnut''', '''provision tree''', '''saba nut''', monguba ([[Brazil]]), '''pumpo''' ([[Guatemala]]) and is commercially sold under the names '''money tree''' and '''money plant'''. This tree is sometimes sold with a braided trunk and is commonly grown as a [[houseplant]], although more commonly what is sold as a \"Pachira aquatica\" houseplant is in fact a similar species, P. glabra.<ref>[http://www.hawaiiantropicalplants.com/fruit.html \"Pachira aquatica\"] ''Hawaiian Tropical Plants Nursery''</ref>\n\n==Description==\n''Pachira aquatica'' can grow up to {{convert|18|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in height in the wild. It has shiny green [[leaf shape|palmate]] leaves with [[lanceolate]] leaflets and smooth green [[bark]]. Its showy flowers have long, narrow [[petal]]s that open like a banana peel to reveal hairlike yellowish orange [[stamen]]s. The tree is cultivated for its edible [[Nut (fruit)|nut]]s, which grow in a large, woody pod. The nuts are light brown, striped with white. They are said to taste like [[peanut]]s, and can be eaten raw, cooked, or ground into flour to make bread. The leaves and flowers are also edible.\n[[File:Pachira aquatica in Hainan - 01.JPG|thumbnail|left]]\nThe tree grows well as a tropical [[ornamental plant|ornamental]] in moist, frost-free areas, and can be started from seed or cutting. It is a durable plant and adapts well to different conditions. The pachira needs plenty of sunlight, though it is important it is not placed in direct sunlight gradually in summer months, as the leaves may get sunburned.\n\nThe fruit, a [[Nut (fruit)|nut]], is of a brownish colour and can measure up to {{convert|12|in}} in length and {{convert|2.5|in}} in diameter. Seeds grow within until such time as the nut bursts, sending the seeds forth and propagating. The nut is edible and often eaten raw or roasted, with a flavor similar to a European chestnut; it may also be ground and made as a hot drink. The fruit is not eaten.<ref>{{cite book|last=Duarte|first=Odilo|author2=Robert E.

The tree had long been popular as an [[ornamental plant|ornamental]] in [[Japan]].  In 1986, a [[Taiwan]]ese truck driver first cultivated five small trees in a single [[flowerpot]] with their [[trunk (botany)|trunk]]s [[braid]]ed.  The popularity of these ornamentals took off in Japan and later much of the rest of East Asia.  They are [[symbol]]ically associated with good financial fortune and are typically seen in [[business]]es, sometimes with red ribbons or other auspicious ornamentation attached.  The trees play an important role in Taiwan's agricultural export economy with exports of [[New Taiwan dollar|NT$]]250 million ([[United States dollar|US$]]7 million) in 2005.<ref>[http://english.www.gov.tw/TaiwanHeadlines/index.jsp?recordid=92685 \"Fancy take on money trees puts Taiwan on the map.\"] ''Taiwan Headlines'' reprint from ''[[Liberty Times]]''. 23 March 2006.

Common names include '''palo verde''', '''Mexican palo verde''', '''Parkinsonia''', '''Jerusalem thorn''', and '''jelly bean tree'''.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe genus name ''Parkinsonia'' honors the English botanist [[John Parkinson (botanist)|John Parkinson]] (1567\u20131650), while the species Latin name ''aculeata'' refers to the thorny stem of this plant.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Parkinsonia aculeata 4.jpg|thumb|220px|Close-up on flowers of ''Parkinsonia aculeata'']] ''Parkinsonia aculeata'' may be a spiny shrub or a small tree. It grows {{convert|2|to|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} high, with a maximum height of {{convert|10|m}}. Palo verde may have single or multiple stems and many branches with pendulous leaves. The [[leaf|leaves]] and stems are [[trichome|hairless]]. The leaves are alternate and pennate (15 to 20&nbsp;cm long). The flattened [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] is edged by two rows of 25\u201330 tiny oval leaflets; the leaflets are soon [[deciduous]] in dry weather (and during the winter in some areas) leaving the green petioles and branches to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]].\n\nThe branches grow double or triple sharp [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spines]] {{convert|7|-|12|mm|in|abbr=on}} long at the axils of the leaves. The [[flower]]s are yellow- orange and fragrant, {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, growing from a long slender stalk in groups of eight to ten. They have  five sepals and five petals, four of them clearer and rhomboid ovate, the fifth elongated, with a warmer yellow and purple spots at the base. The flowering period is the middle months of  spring(March& April or September & October). The flowers are pollinated by bees. The [[fruit]] is a [[legume|seedpod]], leathery in appearance, light brown when mature.\n\n==Invasive problems==\n''P. aculeata'' is a major [[invasive species]] in [[Australia]], parts of tropical [[Africa]], [[Hawaii]], and other [[Pacific islands|Islands]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]].\n\nIt was introduced to Australia as an [[ornamental tree]] and for shade around 1900. It is now a serious [[Invasive species in Australia|weed]] widespread through [[Western Australia]], the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Queensland]], covering about {{convert|8000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land, and has the potential to spread through most of the [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] to subhumid tropical area in Australia.\n\nIt forms dense [[thicket]]s, preventing access for humans, native animals and [[livestock]] to waterways. The fruits (seedpods) float, and the plant spreads by dropping pods into water, or pods are washed downstream by seasonal [[flood]]ing.  Without the scarifying received by tumbling in streambeds, the seeds are slow to germinate.\n\nSeveral control methods are used to reduce the existing population and the spread of ''P. aculeata'' in Australia. Three [[insect]]s have been [[Introduced species|introduced]] to Australia for [[biological control]]; the parkinsonia [[bean weevil]]s, ''Penthobruchus germaini'' and ''Mimosestes ulkei'', both have [[larva]]e that specifically eat the seeds from parkinsonia pods and are proving to be a useful management tool, and the parkinsonia leaf bug, ''Rhinacloa callicrates'', which destroys [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] tissues but has had little overall impact on the plant. Fire is effective for young trees; mechanical removal and [[herbicide]]s are also used.\n\n==Distribution==\n''P. aculeata'' is native to the Sonoran and Chihuahan Deserts of [[southwestern United States]] (western [[Texas]], southern [[New Mexico]] southern [[Arizona]]), and northern [[Mexico]] ([[Sonora]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]) as well as the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]]. Its native range has expanded over the last several decades into the ([[Edwards Plateau]] and [[Central Texas]]).  It has been moved by humans into the [[Caribbean]], [[South America]] south to northern [[Argentina]], and Hawai'i.  It has been introduced in [[Europe]] and it is widespread in [[Australia]].<ref name=\"GRIN\"/>  This thin barked species does not become established in areas where weather dips below 20 degrees F.  It has expanded into Southern California as far north as San Bernardino County.\n\n==Habitat==\n''Parkinsonia aculeata'' has a high tolerance to drought, simply attaining shorter stature. In moist and humus-rich environments it becomes a taller, spreading shade tree.  This plant prefers a full sun exposure, but can grow on a wide range of dry soils (sand dunes, clay, alkaline and chalky soils,etc.), at an altitude of {{convert|0|-|1500|m}} above sea level.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\n\nFile:Caesalpiniaceae - Parkinsonia aculeata-4.JPG|Shrub of ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\nFile:Caesalpiniaceae - Parkinsonia aculeata-1.JPG|Leaflets of ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\nFile:Caesalpiniaceae - Parkinsonia aculeata-2.JPG|Leaflets of ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\nFile:Caesalpiniaceae - Parkinsonia aculeata-3.JPG|Thorns on ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\nFile:Parkinsonia aculeata 3.jpg|Plant of ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\nFile:Parkinsonia aculeata flowers 3.jpg|Flowers of ''Parkinsonia aculeata''\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*Cooperative Centre for Weed Management.

It is classified within the flowering plant family, Lauraceae. It is native to certain areas of Central America and southern Mexico at altitudes between 1,400 m to 1,900 m. The tree grows to about 20 m high, occasionally reaching 50 m.\n\nYoung branches are very hairy. The leaves are deciduous and the flowers are light greenish-yellow, with the stamens turning red with age. The fruit, closely resembling that of the avocado, is generally pear-shaped, with a thick, green, leathery skin. The flesh is oily with a milky juice and tastes like an avocado or [[coconut]]. The pear-shaped fruit is easily mistaken for an avocado. However, it contains a much larger central seed. The flesh has stone cells and a gritty texture that is generally considered unfavourable for edible consumption, despite its appealing taste. The [[cotyledons]], unlike those of the avocado, are pink internally.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{taxonbar}}\n[[Category:Persea|schiedeana]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Panama]]\n[[Category:Vulnerable plants]]\n\n\n{{Fruit-tree-stub}}\n{{Laurales-stub}}",

Patterson|T.F.Patt.]]\n}}\n\n'''''Picea martinezii''''', the '''Martinez spruce''', is a medium-sized [[evergreen]] [[tree]] growing to 25\u201335 m tall, and with a trunk diameter of up to 1 m. It is native to northeast [[Mexico]], where it occurs at two localities in the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] mountains in [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]. It grows at moderate altitudes from 2150\u20132600 m, growing along streamsides in mountain valleys, where moisture levels in the soil are greater than the otherwise low rainfall in the area would suggest.\n\nThe [[bark]] is thin and scaly, flaking off in small circular plates 5\u201310&nbsp;cm across. The crown is conic, with widely spaced branches with drooping branchlets. The shoots are stout, pale buff-brown, glabrous, and with prominent pulvini. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, 23\u201335&nbsp;mm long, stout, moderately flattened in cross-section, bright glossy green with inconspicuous lines of [[stomata]]; the tip is viciously sharp.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|cones]] are pendulous, broad cylindrical, 8\u201316&nbsp;cm long and 3&nbsp;cm broad when closed, opening to 6&nbsp;cm broad. They have stiff, smoothly rounded scales 2-2.5&nbsp;cm broad, and are green, maturing pale brown 6\u20138 months after pollination. The [[seed]]s are black, 4&nbsp;mm long, with a 12\u201316&nbsp;mm long pale brown wing.\n\nMartinez spruce was only discovered in 1981, and is [[endangered species|critically endangered]] with just two small populations, comprising a few hundred trees and a dozen trees respectively. Fossil evidence shows it had a wider distribution in the past, south to central Mexico. It is related to [[Chihuahua spruce]] from northwest Mexico, but differs in the longer, green leaves, and the larger, broader cones with larger scales. No other related spruces are found in [[North America]], with its next-closest relatives in eastern [[Asia]].\n\nIt is a very attractive tree and is starting to be planted as an ornamental tree in botanical gardens, particularly valued in warm areas as it is one of the most heat-tolerant of all spruces. It is named after the Mexican [[botanist]] [[Maximino Mart\u00ednez]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|Picea martinezii}}\n*[http://www.conifers.org/pi/Picea_martinezii.php Gymnosperm Database]\n*[http://www.pinetum.org/PhotoMPF/picmart.gif Photo of tree]\n\n[[Category:Picea|martinezii]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]\n[[Category:Trees of Northeastern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Critically endangered plants]]\n[[Category:Sierra Madre Oriental]]",

It is a [[tree]] growing to 25\u201335 m tall, with a trunk diameter of up {{convert|1.2|m|0|abbr=on}}. The needles are in bundles of 3, 4, or 5, with 5-needle fascicles being the most prevalent. This variability may be a sign of hybridization with the closely related [[ponderosa pine]] (''Pinus ponderosa''). The cones are single, paired, or in whorls of three, and 5\u201311&nbsp;cm long.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe Arizona pine had been thought to be a variant of Ponderosa pine by some botanists, but is now recognized as a distinct species by most authorities.\n\nTwo varieties are described, possibly better treated as distinct species; see [[Ponderosa pine]] for a table of characters:\n*''Pinus arizonica'' var. ''arizonica'', in the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] from [[Arizona]] south to [[Durango (state)|Durango]]\n*''Pinus arizonica'' var ''stormiae'', in the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] from the [[Big Bend National Park]] in Texas south to [[San Luis Potos\u00ed (state)|San Luis Potos\u00ed]].\n\nAnother related pine, [[Cooper's pine]] (''Pinus cooperi'') is also treated as a variety of Arizona pine by some authors, as ''Pinus arizonica'' var. ''cooperi'', but other authors regard this as a distinct species, more closely related to [[Hartweg's pine]] (''Pinus hartwegii'').\n\n==Uses==\nThis pine is a source of construction timber, and is heavily harvested for firewood. Extensive cutting has reduced the formerly widespread Arizona pine forests, particularly in Mexico.\n[[File:Pinus arizonica Mount Lemmon.jpg|thumb|left|''P. arizonica'' forest, [[Mount Lemmon|Mt.

It grows on relatively moist areas with summer rainfalls, however specimens from its eastern and southern distribution live under really wet conditions; it needs full sun and well drained soils. Its temperature needs fluctuate between 19 and 10&nbsp;\u00b0C on average a year. This tree accepts from subtropical to cool climate.\n\n''Pinus ayacahuite'' is a large [[tree]], regularly growing to 30\u201345 m and exceptionally up to 50 m tall. It is a member of the [[Pinus classification|white pine]] group, ''[[Pinus]]'' subgenus ''[[Strobus]]'', and like all members of that group, the [[leaf|leaves]] ('needles') are in fascicles (bundles) of five, with a deciduous sheath. The needles are finely serrated, and 9\u201316&nbsp;cm long. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are long and slender, 15\u201340&nbsp;cm long and 4\u20136&nbsp;cm broad (closed), opening to 6\u201310&nbsp;cm broad; the scales are thin and flexible. The seeds are small, 6\u20138&nbsp;mm long, and have a long slender wing 18\u201325&nbsp;mm long.\n\nIt is moderately susceptible to [[white pine blister rust]] (''Cronartium ribicola''), but in cultivation has proved somewhat less susceptible than most other American white pines (see e.g. [[western white pine]], [[sugar pine]]).\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\nIt has been planted with ornamental and commercial purposes for paper industry at different latitudes and altitudes in different parts of the world:\nIn Equatorial and tropical regions- Commercial production: On the high elevations of [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Angola]].\nIn temperate subtropical regions- Commercial production: It is planted on the highlands of [[South Africa]]. On the highest elevations of Southern [[Brazil]]. Northern India.\nIn temperate regions at middle and low altitudes: Argentine provinces of [[Salta Province|Salta]], [[Tucum\u00e1n Province|Tucuman]] and [[C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina|Cordoba]]; at 500 to 1500 m above sea level.\nAt low elevations near sea level: Commercial production: Australia ([[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]]), New Zealand. As ornamental: It has as been successfully planted in the [[British Isles]]. The largest tree in Germany (height 2013: 20.5 m) is growing in the arboretum [[Sequoiafarm Kaldenkirchen]].<ref>http://www.championtrees.de/5403879d900fef223/5403879d9c0fe7a01/index.html</ref>\n\nDespite its tropical origins (the natural range is entirely south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]]), it is surprisingly tolerant of cold, having survived temperatures down to nearly -30&nbsp;\u00b0C in cultivation in Scotland and [[Pennsylvania]], United States. It is grown as an ornamental tree in parks for its attractive foliage and very long cones, among the longest that can be grown in many temperate areas.\n\nThe [[wood]] is valuable, used for general indoor construction work.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{commons category|Pinus ayacahuite}}\n*Dvorak, W.

It is named after [[Karl Theodor Hartweg]], who discovered it in 1838.\n\n==Distribution==\n''Pinus hartwegii'' is a very high altitude species, growing at altitudes of {{convert|2500|-|4300|m|ft}}. It forms the [[tree line|alpine tree line]] on most of Mexico's higher mountains.   It grows on both the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] and [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] (mountain ranges) (29\u00b0 North latitude) from [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] State and [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]] (26\u00b0) to the highest peaks in the mountain ranges on the [[El Salvador]]\u2014[[Honduras]] border (15\u00b0 North latitude). In the Sierra Madre Occidental this pine grows with very dry winters and a very heavy rainy season in summer, with constant frosts from October to March.\n\nThis pine does not acquire the dwarfed and contorted shape shared by many species at high altitudes. Even at the alpine [[tree line]], this tree is not damaged by the cold and wind-blown ice present at that altitude. Consequently, ''Pinus hartwegii'' has been studied as an evolutionarily unique member on tree line [[ecophysiology]].\n\n[[File:Pinus hartwegii Cofre de Perote.jpg|thumb|left|''P. hartwegii'' at treeline (4030m), [[Cofre de Perote]], Mexico]]\n\n==Description==\n''Pinus hartwegii'' is an [[evergreen]] [[tree]] reaching {{convert|20|-|30|m|ft}} in height, with a broad, rounded crown. The [[bark]] is thick, dark grey-brown, and scaly or fissured. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, dark green, five (occasionally four) per fascicle, 10\u201320&nbsp;cm long and 1.2-1.5&nbsp;mm thick, the persistent fascicle sheath 1.5\u20132&nbsp;cm long.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|cones]] are ovoid, 6\u201313&nbsp;cm long, black or very dark purple, opening when mature in spring to 5\u20137&nbsp;cm broad. The [[seed]]s are winged, 5\u20136&nbsp;mm long with a 1.5-2.5&nbsp;cm wing. Pollination is in late spring, with the cones maturing 20\u201322 months after.\n\nIt is closely related to [[Montezuma pine|''Pinus montezumae'' (Montezuma pine)]] , differing from it in the shorter leaves, black (not brown) and smaller cones; it replaces Montezuma pine at high altitudes, and often [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridises]] with it where they meet at middle altitudes.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{IUCN2006|assessor=Conifer Specialist Group|year=1998|id=42367|title=Pinus hartwegii|downloaded=12 May 2006}}\n*[http://www.conifers.org/pi/pin/hartwegii.htm Gymnosperm Database: ''Pinus hartwegii'']\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Pinus hartwegii|position=left}}\n\n[[Category:Pinus|hartwegii]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Northeastern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Southern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Chiapas]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guerrero]]\n[[Category:Trees of Michoac\u00e1n]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puebla]]\n[[Category:Trees of Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:Trees of Veracruz]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Trees of El Salvador]]\n[[Category:Trees of Honduras]]\n[[Category:Flora of Central Mexico]]\n[[Category:Flora of Northeastern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Flora of Southern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Sierra Madre Occidental]]\n[[Category:Sierra Madre Oriental]]\n[[Category:Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of North America]]",

The Mexican range extends along the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] and [[Sierra Madre del Sur]] from [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] to [[Oaxaca]], from 29\u00b0 North Lat. to 17\u00b0, between 1600 and 3000&nbsp;meters altitude. It requires about a rainfall 600 to 1000&nbsp;mm a year, mostly in summer. It tolerates frosts in winter.\n\n==Description==\nThis member of family [[Pinaceae]] grows to the height of 20&ndash;30 m with a trunk diameter of 35&ndash;80&nbsp;cm. The needles are in bundles of three to five, 5&ndash;10&nbsp;cm (rarely to 15&nbsp;cm) long, and are a bright glossy green to yellowish-green. The cones are ovoid, 4&ndash;7&nbsp;cm (rarely to 8&nbsp;cm) long, and borne on a 1&ndash;2&nbsp;cm long stalk; they are unusual in taking about 30&ndash;32 months to mature, a year longer than most other [[pine]]s. The bark is gray-brownish, and fissured.\n\n==Subspecies==\nThere are two subspecies (treated by some botanists as distinct species, by others as just varieties):\n*''Pinus leiophylla'' subsp. ''leiophylla''. Needles slender (0.5&ndash;0.9&nbsp;mm), in fives. It occurs in the southern part of the range, from [[Oaxaca]] to [[Durango]], is not frost tolerant, and grows in relatively high rainfall conditions.\n*''Pinus leiophylla'' subsp. ''chihuahuana''. Needles stouter (0.9&ndash;1.3&nbsp;mm), in threes. It occurs in the northern part of the range, from Durango to Arizona, tolerates frost down to about &minus;10&nbsp;\u00b0C to &minus;15&nbsp;\u00b0C, and very dry conditions. The needle differences are adaptations to these harsher conditions. Synonyms ''Pinus chihuahuana'', ''Pinus leiophylla'' var.

Its habitat is prone to wildfire, and the species shows some adaptations unusual among pines to cope with this; if the crown is destroyed by fire, the trunk, protected by its thick bark, will send out new shoots to re-grow a new crown. The only other pines to do this are [[Pitch Pine]] (''P. rigida'') and [[Canary Island Pine]] (''P. canariensis''). As none of these are species particularly closely related to each other, the adaptation has probably arisen independently in each, an example of [[convergent evolution]].\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\nThe wood of the ''Pinus leiophylla'' is hard, dense and strong. It is used for construction, firewood, and railroad ties. In [[South Africa]] and [[Queensland]], Australia there are big extensions of this tree planted. It is planted commercially in [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]] at high altitudes.\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/county?state_name=Arizona&statefips=04&symbol=PILE County Distribution in Arizona], from plants.usda.gov\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/county?state_name=New%20Mexico&statefips=35&symbol=PILE County Distribution in New Mexico], from plants.usda.gov\n*[http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/pinus-leiophylla-chihuahua-pine-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map of ''Pinus leiophylla''], from plantmaps.com\n\n<!-- For the name of the Mexican state of Chihuahua -->\n\n[[Category:Pinus|leiophylla]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puebla]]\n[[Category:Trees of Northern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Durango]]\n[[Category:Trees of Chihuahua (state)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of Northeastern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1831]]\n[[Category:Trees of temperate climates]]\n[[Category:Drought-tolerant trees]]\n[[Category:Least concern plants]]",

The tree grows about 35&nbsp;m high and 80&nbsp;cm in diameter; occasionally it may reach a height of 40&nbsp;m and diameter of 1&nbsp;m. It has a round crown. The bark is dark brown-grayish.\n\nIt is found from the Mexican states of [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]] (25\u00b0&nbsp;N). Lat. and [[Jalisco]] (22\u00b0) to the north and to [[Nicaragua]] (15\u00b0&nbsp;S. Lat.) to the south. It occurs on both mountain ranges of the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] and [[Sierra Madre Occidental]].  It grows at altitudes from 2000\u20133200&nbsp;m above sea level. It is found in areas between 800\u20131000&nbsp;mm rainfall per year.   In most of the tree's habitat, rain falls mostly in summer, but in the state of [[Veracruz]], precipitations are spread year round and the climate is very wet.  However, specimens from the state of [[Jalisco]] grow in semi-arid places. It occurs in warm temperate to cool climates (18\u00b0C to 10\u00b0C). At the highest altitudes of its distribution it usually receives snow in the winter.  \n[[File:Pinus montezumae shoots 2 PAN.JPG|thumb|left|Shoot]]\n[[File:Montezuma Pine at Sheffield Park.jpg|thumb|left|Tree]]\nOcote wood is yellowish-brown white, with the heartwood being light brown, is hard, heavy and used for construction. It is appreciated for its resin. The resin is so flammable that a cut branch will burn as a torch emitting black smoke when ignited; for this reason, it is very common in Mexico to use ocote wood as a fire starter for campfires and barbecues. First 3 to 6 years growth is slow, after this stage it is a fast-growing tree. The cities of [[Ocotl\u00e1n, Jalisco|Ocotl\u00e1n]] in [[Jalisco]] Mexico and [[Ocotal]] in [[Nicaragua]] derive their names from this tree.\nPlanted commercially: in South Africa and Queensland, Australia at mid altitudes. \n[[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Bolivia]] at high altitudes.

It is the national tree of [[Honduras]], where it is known as '''ocote'''. Common names include '''ocote chino''',<ref>{{PLANTS|id=PIOO2|taxon=Pinus oocarpa|accessdate=4 October 2015}}</ref> '''pino amarillo''', '''pino avellano''', '''Mexican yellow pine''', '''egg-cone pine''' and '''hazelnut pine'''. It appears that it was the progenitor (original) species that served as the ancestor for some of the other pines of Mexico.\n\n==Habitat and range==\nThis species ranges from latitudes of 14\u00b0 to 29\u00b0 north, including western [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]] and the higher elevations of [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]] and northwestern [[Nicaragua]]. An average temperature of {{convert|15|to|24|C|F|abbr=on}} and annual rainfall of {{convert|1000|-|1900|mm|in|abbr=on}} are needed for best development. Preferred elevations are {{convert|900|-|2400|m|ft|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]]. In El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua it grows above {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on}}.  ''Pinus oocarpa'' var. ''trifoliata'' grows between {{convert|2000|and|2400|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level.\n\n==Uses==\nIt is an important source of commercial timber in [[Honduras]] and [[Central America]]. ''Pinus oocarpa'' was introduced for commercial production of wood for the paper industry: in [[Ecuador]], [[Kenya]], [[Zambia]], [[Colombia]], [[Bolivia]], [[Queensland]] (Australia), [[Brazil]] and [[South Africa]]. Due to the amount of resin within the tree, many Central Americans will use small shavings to start cooking fires.\n\n==References==\n{{commonscat}}\n{{wikispecies}}\n{{reflist}}\n*Eguiluz, T. 1982.

It grows from 24\u00b0 to 18\u00b0 North latitude and 1800 to 2700 m above sea level. The tree is 30 meters tall. It cannot not stand long periods of temperatures as low as \u201310&nbsp;\u00b0C, but resists occasional brief below zero dips. It is moderately drought-tolerant, in this respect it is superior to ''[[Pinus taeda]]''. Rainfall range is from 750 to 2000&nbsp;mm annual average, it happens mostly in summer but in a little area of the State of [[Veracruz]] on the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] its habitat is rainy year round.\n\nIt is planted at high altitudes in Ecuador (3500 m), Bolivia, Colombia (3300m), Kenya, Tanzania, Angola, Zimbabwe, Papua New Guinea, and Hawaii (3000 m). In Hawaii it is replacing the native alpine grassland.\n\nAt lower altitudes than its origin country it is cultivated in Southern Brazil, South Africa, India, and in the Argentine provinces of C\u00f3rdoba and San Luis.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.rama.com.ar/rama_newasp/PaginasIngles/Especies.asp?itemMenu=6&subitemMenu=12| title=Mexican conifers in San Luis Province, Argentina}}</ref> it is planted for forestation purposes in lands originally covered by bushland.\n\nIt has been introduced near sea level in New South Wales, Australia, where it spreads naturally by wind and is very favored because rainfalls are more abundant in summer. It was also introduced in New Zealand for commercial purposes and is fully naturalized there. It is cultivated in the United Kingdom as an ornamental tree for parks and gardens, and has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Pinus patula''|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=3838|accessdate=30 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe timber is pale-pink to salmon, moderately soft, brittle and smelling strongly of [[anise]]ed when freshly cut.\n\n==Taxonomic notes==\nThere are two varieties:\n\n1. ''P. patula'' Schiede ex Schlechtendal et Chamisso var. patula. Type Mexico, Veracruz: Cruz Blanca, \"Inter Cruz blanca & Jalacingo,\" 1828.11, Schiede and Deppe 1108 (lectotype, HAL). Syn.: Pinus patula Schiede ex Schlechtendal et Chamisso var. macrocarpa M.T. Masters, Gard. Chron., ser. 3, 9: 438, fig. 92. 1891. Type. Gard. Chron., ser. 3, 9: 435, fig. 92. 189 1. (lectotype) (Farjon and Styles 1997).\n\n2. ''P. patula'' Schiede ex Schlechtendal et Chamisso var. longipedunculata Loock ex Mart\u00ednez, Pinos Mexicanos, ed. 2, 333, figs. 276-280, 1948. Type Mexico, Oaxaca: Rancho Benito Ju\u00e1rez (Rancho Tablas), 1947.07, Loock 113a (holotype, PRF-n.v.; isotype, MEXU) (Farjon and Styles 1997).\n\nFarjon and Styles (1997) provide the following notes on the history of the species and its varieties: \"Schlechtendal and Chamisso (1831) gave under C.J.W. Schiede & F. Deppe 1108 a concise description of a 3-leaved pine, of which they had seen no cones ('strobilo . . . nobis deficiente') in the material presented to them. ... Gordon (1875) described Pinus patula (var.) macrocarpa based on collections by C.J.W. Schiede with a cone size 'from 6-7 inches long and 2 inches broad', which, if correct, would be quite outside the range of this species as here defined. Masters (1891) formally published this combination and provided an illustration of the cone. No specimen has been traced in the herbaria to match the descriptions and/or the illustration. The illustration in Masters (1891) is therefore designated as the lectotype. ... Mart\u00ednez (1948) ascribed his new variety P. patula var. longipedunculata to Loock, who coined the name on the label of the type specimen. He described it as different from 'typical\u2019 P. patula in having 2 resin ducts in the leaves instead of 3 and in having pedunculate (5\u201315&nbsp;mm) cones versus sessile cones. Perry (1991) allows it occasionally 3 resin ducts.\"\n\nFarjon and Styles (1997) also report that \"Styles (1976) concluded that 'it agrees phenotypically in all botanical characters' with those mentioned by Martinez (1940) under P. oocarpa var. ochoterenae and synonymized both under P. patula. He later expressed a different view (Styles, 1984) but stopped short of formally synonymizing these two taxa under his newly created combination P. patula subsp. tecunumanii. From his determinations of specimens it appears that P. oocarpa var. ochoterenae Mart\u00ednez was treated as a synonym of P. patula subsp. tecunumanii (see under P. tecunumanii), but that at least more-recently collected material (Higman, Padilla & Styles 40) was again accepted as P. patula (subsp.) longipedunculata. Observation in the field and study of type material by A. Farjon confirm recognition of this taxon as a variety if peduncle length is coupled with persistence and serotiny, which may point to different adaptive traits between the two taxa.\" Note that Furman et al. (1997) have used RAPD markers to show clear and substantial genetic differences between P. patula and P. tecunumanii, establishing the latter as a good species.\n\n[[File:CL-60 Pinus patula & Pinus greggii range map.png|thumb|200px|1966 range map for ''Pinus patula'' and ''Pinus greggii'']]\n\nClosely related species include ''[[Pinus greggii]]'', ''P. jaliscana'', ''P. oocarpa'', ''P. praetermissa'', ''P. pringlei'', and ''P. tecunumanii'', all of which also are native to Mexico.\n\n==Description==\nThe tree grows to 40 m tall and 100&nbsp;cm dbh, usually with a single, straight, slender trunk; in closed canopy stands, the depth of the conical or domed crown is ca. 33%.\n\nThe Bark on young trees is thin, scaly, red-brown, with age becoming thick, dark grey-brown, rough and scaly with large elongated plates and deep longitudinal fissures. First-order branches are long, slender, spreading or slightly ascending; higher order branches are slender, drooping, the ultimate branches pendent. The shoots are rough and scaly when the leaf fascicles have fallen, yellow- to red-brown, foliage shoots with prominent, decurrent pulvini. Cataphylls subulate, recurved at apex, scarious, with erose-ciliate margins, brown, early deciduous. Vegetative buds oblong to cylindrical, the terminal bud 15\u201320&nbsp;mm long, the laterals shorter, brown, not resinous; the scales spreading, subulate, ciliate at margins. Fascicle sheaths initially 20\u201330&nbsp;mm long with 6-8 imbricate, chartaceous, white-yellow to orange-brown scales, persistent but shortening to 12\u201315&nbsp;mm in mature fascicles, slowly weathering to grey-brown.\n\nLeaves in fascicles of 3-4(-5), in drooping tufts, typically in two rows on either side of the upturned shoot, persisting 2\u20133 years, thin, lax, drooping to pendent, (11-)15-25(-30) cm \u00d7 0.7-0.9(-1) mm, serrulate at the margins, acute, pale green to dark green. Stomata on all faces of the leaves, in 4-6(-7) lines on the convex abaxial face and 2-3(4) lines on each adaxial face. The leaves are triangular in cross section, the hypodermis usually with a double layer of cells; resin ducts (1-)2-3(4), medial, occasionally 1 internal, stele oval in cross section; outer walls of endodermal cells not thickened; vascular bundles 2, distinct, the xylem strands often connate.\n\nPollen cones crowded near the proximal end of new shoots, spreading, subtended by scarious bracts, ovoid-oblong to cylindrical, 15-20 \u00d7 5\u20136&nbsp;mm, pink-yellow, turning yellow-brown. Seed cones subterminal or lateral, in whorls of 2 to many, rarely solitary, persistent or deciduous, on short or moderately long (to 20&nbsp;mm) peduncles. Immature cones ovoid, on short or long recurved peduncles with persistent cataphylls, purple turning light brown, maturing in two seasons. Mature cones narrowly ovoid when closed, usually slightly curved, more or less asymmetrical at base, 5-10(-12) \u00d7 (3-)4-6.5&nbsp;cm when open.\n\nSeed scales 100-150, serotinous or parting some time after maturing, tenacious or deciduous with the peduncle, (thin) woody, oblong, usually curved when spreading, the proximal scales connate, purple-brown to dark brown, with adaxial light brown marks left by seed wings. Apophysis nearly flat to slightly raised, transversely keeled, more or less gibbous on the proximal scales, more so on one side of the cone, rhombic, upper margin acute or obtuse-rounded, abaxial surface striate or smooth, (lustrous) ochraceous or yellow-brown. Umbo dorsal, flat or raised, often sunken into the apophysis, 3\u20137&nbsp;mm wide, grey, with a minute, deciduous prickle. Seeds obliquely ovoid, flattened, 4-6 \u00d7 2\u20134&nbsp;mm, dark gray. Seed wings articulate, held to the seed by two oblique claws which partly cover the seed on one side, obliquely ovate-oblong, 12-18 \u00d7 5\u20138&nbsp;mm, light brown with dark stripes (Farjon and Styles 1997).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Eguiluz T.1982.

It is also found as the [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''Pinus radiata'' var. ''binata'' or '''Guadalupe pine''' on Guadalupe Island, and a possibly separable ''P. radiata'' var./[[subspecies|subsp.]] ''cedrosensis'' on Cedros Island, both in the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of the northern Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.\n\nIn Australia, New Zealand, and Spain it is the leading introduced tree<ref>Scott, C. W. 1960. Pinus radiata. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Forestry and Forest Products Study 14. Rome, Italy. 328 p. cited in {{Silvics |volume=1 |genus=Pinus |species=radiata |first1=Philip M. |last1=McDonald |first2=Robert |last2=J. Laacke |accessdate=2013-09-14}}</ref> and in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Kenya, and South Africa it is a major plantation species. It is also an [[Sandy Point, Tristan da Cunha|introduced tree]] on the world's most remote inhabited island, [[Tristan da Cunha]].\n\n==Description==\n''Pinus radiata'' is a [[pinophyta|coniferous]] [[evergreen]] tree growing to between {{convert|15|-|30|m|abbr=on}} in height in the wild, but up to {{convert|60|m|abbr=on}} in cultivation in optimum conditions, with upward pointing branches and a rounded top. The [[leaf|leaves]] ('needles') are bright green, in clusters of three (two in var. ''binata''), slender, {{convert|8|-|15|cm|abbr=on}} long and with a blunt tip. The [[conifer cone|cones]] are {{convert|7|-|17|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, brown, ovoid (egg-shaped), and usually set asymmetrically on a branch, attached at an oblique angle. The [[bark]] is fissured and dark grey to brown.\n\nIt is closely related to [[bishop pine]] and [[knobcone pine]], hybridizing readily with both species; it is distinguished from the former by needles in threes (not pairs), and from both by the cones not having a sharp spine on the scales.\n\nThe modern tree is vastly different from the native tree of Monterey. In plantations the tree is commonly planted at 4m x 4m spacing on a wide variety of landscapes from flat to moderately steep hills. Because of selective breeding and more recently the extensive use of Growth Factor seedlings,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} forests planted since the 1990s are of superior wood with very straight tall trunks without the problem of twin leaders. The trees are pruned in 3 lifts so that the lower 2/3 of a mature tree is branch- ( and hence knot-) free.\nIn its natural state, the wood is poor quality: twisted, knotty and full of sap/resin only really suitable for firewood, but the modern product is very different.\n\n==Ecology==\nMonterey pine is a species adapted to cope with stand-killing fire disturbance. Its cones are serotinous, i.e. they remain closed until opened by the heat of a forest fire; the abundant seeds are then discharged to regenerate on the burned forest floor. The cones may also burst open in hot weather.<ref>[Little, Elbert L. Jr. 1980. The Audubon Society field guide to North American trees. New York: Alfred A. Knopf.]</ref>\n\nIn its native range, Monterey pine is associated with a characteristic flora and fauna. It is the co-dominant canopy tree together with ''[[Cupressus macrocarpa]]'' which naturally occurs only in coastal [[Monterey County]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=62524 |title=Monterey Cypress (''Cupressus macrocarpa'') |last1=Hogan |first1=C.

''radiata'' (Monterey pine proper) are infected and under threat of [[Local extinction|extirpation]] from pine pitch [[canker]] caused by ''[[Fusarium circinatum]]'', a fungal disease native to the southeast United States and found (in 1986) to have been introduced to California. When trees begin to die of the disease, they attract bark beetles which provide a pathway for infection of other trees. In some stands, 80\u201390% of trees are infected. If the disease is introduced in agroforestry areas dependent upon Monterey pine, such as New Zealand, it could have catastrophic effects in those countries as well.<ref name=\"Gymnospermdatabase\"/>\n\n[[Sphaeropsis blight]] (''Diplodia pinea'') infects ''P.radiata'' in California and causes serious damage to plantations of the species in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa,<ref>http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/fidls/diplodia/diplodiafidl.htm</ref> especially after hail damage to growing tips.\n\n===Baja California===\nOn Guadalupe Island, var. ''binata'' is [[critically endangered]]. Most of the population was destroyed as tens of thousands of [[feral]] [[goat]]s ate ''binata'' seedlings and caused soil erosion from the mid-19th century until just a few years ago. The older trees gradually died off until by 2001\u20132002 the population stood at only one hundred. With a program to remove the goats essentially complete by 2005, hundreds of young Guadalupe pines have started to grow up in habitat fenced after 2001, the first significant new growth in about 150 years. Possible accidental introduction of pine pitch canker is considered the biggest threat at present to the survival of the Guadalupe Island pine population.<ref>Junak, S.; Keitt, B.; Tershy, B.; Croll, D. & S\u00e1nchez, J.A.

It is brittle when bent, so does not have the same load-bearing features as Oregon pine ([[Douglas fir]], ''Pseudotsuga'').\n\nRadiata is used in house construction as weatherboards, posts, beams or plywood, in fencing, retaining walls, for concrete formers. It is also used to a limited extent in boat building where untreated ply is sometimes used, but must be encased in epoxy resin to exclude moisture.\n\nThe wood is normally kiln dried to 12% moisture in 6&nbsp;m long, clear lengths. It is available treated with a range of chemical salts, or untreated. Chemical salt treatment is well proven and such timber is frequently used in the ground as posts and poles as part of structures such as retaining walls and pole houses. The name applied to this treatment is tanalized wood. H1 and H2 treatment is suited to indoor use. H3 is the standard house timber and this grade is used for fence palings.

It is considered an [[invasive species]] in [[Hawaii]].\n\n== Description ==\n\n''Pithecellobium dulce'' is a [[tree]] that reaches a height of about {{convert|10|to|15|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Its trunk is spiny and its leaves are [[Pinnate|bipinnate]]. Each pinna has a single pair of ovate-oblong [[leaflet (botany)|leaflets]] that are about {{convert|2|to|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The [[flower]]s are greenish-white, fragrant, sessile and reach about {{convert|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, though appear shorter due to coiling. The flowers produce a [[Legume|pod]], which turns pink when ripe and opens to expose an edible pulp. The pulp contains black shiny seeds that are circular and flat.\n\nThe seed is [[Seed dispersal#By animals|dispersed]] via birds that feed on the sweet pulp. The tree is [[Drought tolerance|drought resistant]] and can survive in dry lands from sea level to an elevation of {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}}, making it suitable for cultivation as a street tree.\n\n== Vernacular names ==\n\nDepending on the region of its occurrence, ''Pithecellobium dulce'' is known by different names. In its native [[Mexico]], the tree is known as huamuche, guamuche / huam\u00fachil/ guam\u00fachil / cuam\u00fachil / deriving from its [[Nahuatl]] name ''cuauhmochitl''. In the wider region it is also called  \"pinz\u00e1n\"', or 'guam\u00e1 americano'' ([[Puerto Rico]]).\n\nIt is called \"seema chintakaya\" (\u0c38\u0c40\u0c2e \u0c1a\u0c3f\u0c02\u0c24\u0c15\u0c3e\u0c2f) in Telugu. '''Monkeypod''' is as English name,<ref>{{PLANTS|id=PIDU|taxon=Pithecellobium dulce|accessdate=6 October 2015}}</ref> but is also used for several other plants, including ''[[Albizia saman]]''.

In odisha it is called Seema Kaiyan(Odia).\n\nIn India it goes by the name \"Madras thorn\", although it is not native to [[Madras]]. The name \"Manila tamarind\" is also misleading, since it is neither closely related to [[tamarind]], nor native to [[Manila]].\n\nIn Kuwait it has the same name as in India but in Arabic \"Showkat Madras\". Showkat meaning \"thorn\" and that would mean Madras Thorn. It appears to have been introduced in Kuwait in the 60's or 70's and maybe introduced by Indians. One can still see the remains of the tree or living trees in the public parks established during the 60's up until the 1980's in Kuwait City. The tree is rarely sold in commercial nurseries but the old gardeners seem to know it.\n\n== Uses ==\n\n=== As food ===\n\nThe seed pods contain a sweet and sour pulp that which in Mexico is eaten raw as an accompaniment to various meat dishes and used as a base for drinks with sugar and water (''agua de huam\u00fachil''). The seeds are also edible and refined to extract oil, which amounts to 10% of their weight. They also contain 28% protein.<ref name=\"conabio.gob.mx\">Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity: ''Pithecellobium Dulce'': http://www.conabio.gob.mx/conocimiento/info_especies/arboles/doctos/45-legum38m.pdf</ref>\n\n=== As medicine ===\nThe bark and pulp are [[astringent]] and [[hemostatic]].{{medcn|date=October 2015}} The [[indigenous peoples]] of [[Mesoamerica]] use the pulp and bark against gum ailments, [[toothache]] and [[hemorrhages]] in general.{{cn|date=October 2015}} A bark extract is also used against [[dysentery]], chronic [[diarrhea]] and [[tuberculosis]].{{medcn|date=October 2015}} An extract of the leaves is used for gall ailments and to prevent [[miscarriage]].{{medcn|date=October 2015}} The ground seed is used to clean [[ulcers]].<ref name=\"conabio.gob.mx\"/>\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n''Pithecellobium dulce'' is a host plant for the [[caterpillar]]s of the red-bordered pixie (''[[Melanis pixe]]''), three-spot grass yellow (''[[Eurema blanda]]'') and many other moths.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.butterfliesandmoths.org/species?l=1646 |title=Red-bordered Pixie ''Melanis pixe'' (Boisduval, 1836) |publisher=Butterflies and Moths of North America |accessdate=2010-09-19}}</ref>\n\n== Synonyms ==\n[[File:Pithecellobium dulce, Fort Canning.jpg|thumb|''Pithecellobium dulce'', Heritage Tree, Madras Thorn, Fort Canning, Singapore]]\n\n''Pithecellobium dulce'' is known under numerous [[junior synonym]]s:<ref>{{aut|International Legume Database & Information Service (ILDIS)}} (2005): [http://www.ildis.org/LegumeWeb?version~10.01&LegumeWeb&tno~152&genus~Pithecellobium&species~dulce ''Pithecellobium dulce''].

The [[bark]] is silvery-white, smooth or lightly fissured when young, becoming dark gray and deeply fissured on old trees. The twigs are grayish-yellow and stout, with large triangular leaf scars. The winter buds are slender, pointed, {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|in|frac=4}} long, yellowish brown, and resinous. It is one of the fastest growing trees in North America. In Mississippi River bottoms, height growth of {{convert|10|\u2013|15|ft|m|round=5}} per year for a few years have been seen.

The leaf is very coarsely toothed, the teeth are curved and gland tipped, and the petiole is flat; they are dark green in the summer and turn yellow in the fall (but many cottonwoods in dry locations drop their leaves early from the combination of drought and leaf rust, making their fall color dull or absent). Due to the flat stem of the leaf, the leaf has the tendency to shake from even the slightest breeze.

Like some other species in the genus ''Populus'', they are commonly known as [[cottonwood (disambiguation)|cottonwood]]s. The species are native to North America, Europe, and western Asia. In the past, as many as six species were recognized, but recent trends have been to accept just three species, treating the others as subspecies of ''P. deltoides''.\n\n\nThey are large, deciduous trees. they are 20\u201345f tall, distinguished by thick, deeply fissured bark and triangular-based to diamond-shaped leaves that are green on both sides (without the whitish wax on the undersides) and without any obvious balsam scent in spring. An important feature of the leaves is the [[Petiole (botany)petiole, which is flattened sideways so that the leaves have a particular type of movement in the wind.\n\nMale and female flowers are in separate catkins, appearing before the leaves in spring.  The seeds are borne on cottony structures that allow them to be blown long distances in the air before settling to ground.\n\nThe cottonwoods are exceptionally tolerant of flooding, erosion, and flood deposits filling around the trunk.\n\nAlthough each of the three cottonwood species has a different leaf pattern, they all have the same general diamond leaf shape.\n\n==Species==\n===''Populus deltoides''===\n[[File:Cottonwood 20090521 083459 1.jpg|thumbnail|Seeds and seed hairs from an eastern cottonwood]]\n\n[[Populus deltoides|Eastern cottonwood]] (''Populus deltoides'') is one of the largest North American [[hardwood]] trees, although the wood is rather soft. It is a [[riparian zone]] tree. It occurs throughout the eastern United States and in extreme southern Canada. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate and simple, with coarsely toothed (crenate/serrate) edges, and subcordate at the base. The leaf shape is roughly triangular, hence the species name, ''deltoides''.\n\nIn the typical subspecies ''P. d. deltoides'' ([[Vermont]] south to northern [[Florida]] and west to about [[Michigan]]), the leaves are broad and triangular, 7\u201315&nbsp;cm across at the base. Further west ([[Minnesota]] south to eastern [[Texas]]), the subspecies ''P. d. monilifera'' (plains cottonwood; syn. ''P. sargentii'') has somewhat narrower leaves, 5\u201310&nbsp;cm wide at the base. This is also the [[list of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[Nebraska]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Kansas]]. In West Texas, [[New Mexico]], and [[Colorado]], the subspecies ''P. d. wislizeni'' (Rio Grande cottonwood; syn. ''P. wislizeni'') occurs.\n\n===''Populus fremontii''===\n[[Populus fremontii|Fremont's cottonwood]] (''Populus fremontii'') is native to the southwestern United States and western Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-taxon=Populus+fremontii|work=Calflora Database|title=''Populus fremontii'' (Fremont cottonwood)}}</ref> In the United States, the species can be found in [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Utah]].

The wood is coarse and of fairly low value, used for pallet boxes, shipping crates, and similar purposes where a cheap but strong enough wood is suitable. They are also widely grown as screens and [[shelterbelt]]s. Many of the cottonwoods grown commercially are the [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of eastern cottonwood and black poplar, ''Populus \u00d7 canadensis'' (hybrid black poplar or Carolina poplar).\n\nCottonwood bark is often a favorite medium for artisans. The bark, which is usually harvested in the fall after a tree's death, is generally very soft and easy to carve.\n\nCottonwood is one of the poorest [[wood fuel]]s; it does not dry well, and rots quickly. It splits poorly, because it is very fibrous. It produces a low level of energy per unit of volume of wood.<ref>[http://www.chimneysweeponline.com/howood.htm Sweep's Library: Firewood Comparison Charts] The Chimney Sweep.</ref>\n\nCottonwoods serve as food for the [[caterpillar]]s of several [[Lepidoptera]] ([[list of Lepidoptera that feed on poplars]]).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/trees_shrubs/bigtree/deciduous.html Minnesota DNR big tree list].

The Great Alaska Nature Factbook. Portland: Alaska Northwest Books, 1996.</ref>\n\n=== Dieback ===\nBeginning in 1996, individual North American scientists noticed an increase in dead or dying aspen trees. As this accelerated in 2004, word spread and a debate over causes began. No insect, disease, or environmental condition is yet specifically identified as a joint cause. Trees adjacent to one another are often stricken or not. In other instances, entire groves have died.\n\nMany areas of the Western US have experienced increased diebacks which are often attributed to ungulate grazing and [[wildfire suppression]]. At high altitudes where grasses can be rare, [[ungulate]]s can browse young aspen sprouts and prevent those young trees from reaching maturity. As a result, some aspen groves close to cattle or other grazing animals, such as deer or elk, have very few young trees and can be invaded by [[conifers]], which are not typically browsed. Another possible deterrent to aspen regeneration is widespread wildfire suppression.  Aspens are vigorous [[resprouter]]s and even though the above-ground portion of the organism may die in a wild-fire, the roots, which are often protected from lethal temperatures during a fire, will sprout new trees soon after a fire.  Disturbances such as fires seem to be a necessary ecological event in order for aspens to compete with conifers, which tend to replace aspen over long, disturbance-free intervals.  The current dieback in the American West may have roots in the strict fire suppression policy in the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} On the other hand, the widespread decimation of conifer forests by the [[mountain pine beetle]] may provide increased opportunities for aspen groves to proliferate under the right conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112713000352 | doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2013.01.008 | volume=299 | title=How will aspen respond to mountain pine beetle?

Yet they are still widely used in campgrounds because they are cheap and plentiful and not widely used in building lumber. Pioneers in the North American west used them to create [[log cabins]] and [[dugout (shelter)|dugouts]], though they were not the preferred species.\n\nThe leaves of the quaking aspen and other species in the genus ''Populus'' serve as food for [[caterpillar]]s of various moths and butterflies. See [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on poplars]].\n\nIn Canada, quaking aspen wood is used mainly for pulp products such as books, newsprint, and fine printing paper. It is especially good for panel products such as [[oriented strand board]] and [[waferboard]]. It is light in weight and is used for furniture, boxes and crates, core stock in plywood, and wall panels.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons and category-inline}}\n* {{Wikispecies-inline}}\n* [http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/poptre/all.html US Forest Service Fire Effects Information System: ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* [http://www.abtreegene.com/trees.html Alberta Forest Genetic Resources Council: ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/populus-tremuloides-quaking-aspen-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map for ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* {{ITIS |id=195773 |taxon=Populus tremuloides |accessdate=8 August 2006}}\n* Farrar, John Laird.

Today, the tree is cultivated not only in [[Mexico]], but also in [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[South Florida]] for its fruit, which is commonly eaten in many [[Latin America]]n countries. Mamey can be found in many Latin American communities throughout the USA, where it is made into milkshakes and ice cream among other things.\n\nSome of its names in Latin American countries, such as ''mamey colorado'' ([[Cuba]]),<ref>[http://www.ecured.cu/Mamey_colorado Ecured - Mamey colorado]</ref> ''zapote colorado'' ([[Costa Rica]]) and ''zapote rojo'' ([[South America]]), refer to the reddish colour of its flesh in order to distinguish it from the unrelated but similar looking ''[[Mammea americana]]'', whose fruit is usually called \"yellow mamey\" ({{lang-es|Mamey amarillo}}).<ref>[http://www.ecured.cu/Mamey_amarillo Ecured - Mamey amarillo]</ref>\n\nThe Australian and Queensland Government\u2019s research and development programs have produced mamey sapote in [[Australia]].\n\n==Description==\nMamey sapote is a large and highly [[ornamental plant|ornamental]] [[evergreen]] tree that can reach a height of {{convert|15|to|45|m|ft|sp=us}} at maturity.<ref>[https://hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/sapote_ars.html Morton, Julia 1987.

Flowers appear shortly after leaf development. The flowers are in 5\u201310&nbsp;cm long green-yellow cylindrical spikes, which occur in clusters of 2 to 5 at the ends of branches. Pods are 20 to 30&nbsp;cm long and contain between 10 and 30 seeds per pod. A mature plant can produce hundreds\nof thousands of seeds. Seeds remain viable for up to 10 years. The tree reproduces by way of seeds, not vegetatively. Seeds are spread by cattle and other animals that consume the seed pods and spread the seeds in their droppings.<ref name=\"Lalith Gunasekera 2009, pp. 101-102\">Lalith Gunasekera, ''Invasive Plants: A guide to the identification of the most invasive plants of Sri Lanka'', Colombo 2009, pp. 101-102.</ref>\n\nIts roots are able to grow to a great depth in search of water: in 1960, they were discovered at a depth of 53 meters (175 feet) at an open-pit mine near [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]],<ref name=\"Philips1963\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Phillips | first1 = W.

It is claimed that ''P. julifllora'' existed and was recognised even as a holy tree in ancient India, but this is most likely a confusion with [[Prosopis cineraria]].

It is also a major weed in the southwestern United States. It is hard and expensive to remove as the plant can regenerate from the roots.<ref name=\"environment.gov.au\">\"Mesquite (Prosopis species)\" Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Canberra, at http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/weeds/publications/guidelines/wons/pubs/prosopis.pdf</ref>\n\nIn Australia, mesquite has colonized more than 800,000 hectares of arable land, having severe economic and environmental impacts. With its thorns and many low branches it forms impenetrable thickets which prevent cattle from accessing watering holes, etc. It also takes over pastoral grasslands and uses scarce water. Livestock which consume excessive amounts of seed pods are poisoned. It causes land erosion due to the loss of the grasslands that are habitats for native plants and animals. It also provides shelter for feral animals such as pigs and cats.<ref name=\"environment.gov.au\"/>\n\nIn the [[Afar Region]] in Ethiopia, where the mesquite was introduced in the late 1970s and early 1980s, its aggressive growth leads to a [[monoculture]], denying native plants water and sunlight, and not providing food for native animals and cattle. The regional government with the [[non-governmental organisation]] [[FARM-Africa]] are looking for ways to commercialize the tree's wood, but pastoralists who call it the \"Devil Tree\" insist that ''P. juliflora'' be eradicated.<ref>Caroline Irby, [http://www.dankalia.com/ethiopia/tree.htm \"Devil of a problem: the tree that's eating Africa\"] (accessed 14 January 2009)</ref>\n\nIn Sri Lanka this mesquite was planted in the 1950s near [[Hambantota]] as a shade and erosion control tree. It then invaded the grasslands in and around Hambantota and the [[Bundala National Park]], causing similar problems as in Australia and Ethiopia.<ref name=\"Lalith Gunasekera 2009, pp. 101-102\"/> This [[mesquite]] ''Prosopis juliflora'' native to Central and South America, is also known as ''katu andara''. It was introduced in 1880 and has become a serious problem as an invasive species.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gunasekera |first=Lalith |title=Will Katu-andara Destroy the Biodiversity of Bundala Wet Land? |url=http://www.srilankaguardian.org/2011/12/will-katu-andra-destroy-biodiversity-of.html |newspaper=The Sri Lanka Guardian |date=6 December 2011 |accessdate=11 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\n[[File:Vilaiti Keekar (Prosopis juliflora) W IMG 6935.jpg|thumb|right|''P. juliflora'' [[inflorescence]]s and leaves, [[Krishna Wildlife Sanctuary]] (Andhra Pradesh, India)]]\n\n===Vernacular names===\n''Prosopis juliflora'' has a wide range of vernacular names, although no widely used [[English language|English]] one except for ''[[mesquite]]'', which is used for several species of ''[[Prosopis]]''.

The ''angaraji'' and ''vilayati'' names mean they were introduced by Europeans, while ''Kabuli kikar'' (or ''keekar'') means \"[[Kabul]] acacia\"; ''babul'' specifically refers to ''[[Acacia nilotica]]'' and ''khejra'' (or ''khejri'') to ''[[Prosopis cineraria]]'', both of which are native to South Asia. In [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] it is called ''gando baval'' and in Marwari, ''baavlia''. In Karnataka, in [[Kannada]] it is known as ''Ballaari Jaali'' meaning \"Jaali\", local name, abundant in and around [[Bellary district]].

It is a [[legume]] adapted to a dry, [[desert]] climate.  Though considered to be a [[Noxious weeds|noxious weed]] in states outside its natural range, it plays a vital role in the ecology of the [[Sonoran Desert]].\n\n==Distribution==\nVelvet mesquite is native to the [[Sonoran Desert|Sonoran]], [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]], and [[Chihuahuan Desert|Chihuahuan]] Deserts.  It grows at elevations below 4,000 to 5,000 feet in desert [[grassland]]s and near [[Arroyo (creek)|washes]].  The main distribution is in central and southern [[Arizona]] and in adjacent [[Sonora]], Mexico.  Near waterways, mesquites can form deciduous woodlands called [[bosque]]s.<ref name=\"fs\">\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/provel/all.html\n|title=Prosopis velutina\n|publisher=www.fs.fed.us\n|accessdate=2008-05-01\n|last=\n|first=\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Prosopis velutina Anza-Borrego.jpg|thumb|Blossoming ''P. velutina'' in [[Anza-Borrego Desert State Park]]]]\nVelvet mesquite can grow to 30\u201350&nbsp;ft (9\u201315 m) tall or more.  It grows larger in areas with ample water, smaller in open, dry [[grassland]]s.  The youngest branches may be green and [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]].<ref>Turner, Raymond M. 1963. Growth in four species of Sonoran Desert trees.  Ecology. 44: 760-765.</ref>  Young bark is reddish-brown and smooth.  As it matures, it becomes a dark, dusty gray or brown and takes on a shredded texture.  Yellow thorns up to one inch long appear on the young branches.  The [[Leaf|leaves]] are about 3-6 in (7.5\u201315&nbsp;cm) long, fine, and [[Pinnate|bipinnately compound]].  They fold closed at night.  \n[[Image:Mesquite-leaves-fold.jpg|thumb|700px|center|Composite image of velvet mesquite leaves folding up in the evening in response to decreasing light levels]]\n\nThe [[taproot]] sinks deep into the earth, far deeper than the height of the tree, taking advantage of water sources inaccessible to most plants.  Roots extend to about 50&nbsp;ft (15 m), but depths as much as 175&nbsp;ft (53 m) have been recorded.<ref name=\"fs\" />\n\n[[Image:Prosopis velutina seeds.jpg|thumb|right|Velvet mesquite [[seed]]s]]\n[[Image:Velvet mesquite pods.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Dry velvet mesquite [[Legume|seedpods]]]]\n[[Image:Velvet mesquite catkins.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Flowering velvet mesquite catkins]]\n\nThe mesquite is [[deciduous]], losing its leaves in winter, and leafs out again in the spring when all danger of frost is past.  Because of its deep [[root]] system, it keeps its leaves in the dry months of summer in all but the most severe [[drought]] years.  The [[flower]]s are yellow and form in the spring (after the leaves) in dense cylindrical clusters ([[catkin]]s) roughly {{convert|4|in|cm|abbr=on}} long.  Long seedpods ([[legume]]s) form from the flowers.  They are bright green and look somewhat like pea pods when young. Mature, dry pods are hard and contain several hard, dry, brown [[seed]]s.  The seeds need to be [[Scarification (botany)|scarified]] before they can [[Germination|germinate]].  This scarification typically takes place in the digestive tracts of animals, which eat the seeds and then [[Seed dispersal|disperse]] them widely, as the seed takes days to pass through the animal.<ref>Fisher, C. E.; Meadors, C. H.; Behrens, R.; [and others]. 1959. Control of mesquite on grazing lands. Bull. 935. College Station, TX: Texas Agricultural Experiment Station. 24 p. In cooperation with: U.S. Department of Agriculture.</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\nThe mesquite contributes greatly to the [[desert]] ecosystem.  [[Coyote]]s, [[Round-tailed Ground Squirrel|round-tailed ground squirrel]]s, [[Collared Peccary|collared peccaries]], [[mule deer]], [[white-tailed deer]], and [[Hare|jackrabbits]] all eat mesquite pods, as do livestock when they are available.<ref name=\"fs\" /> [[Bird]]s feed on the flower buds.  As a member of the legume family, mesquites [[Nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] in the [[soil]].  Mesquites can serve as [[nurse tree]]s to young [[Cactus|cacti]], such as the [[saguaro]]. The shade of its branches provides protection for small [[mammal]]s, especially burrowing animals.  Native Americans used the seeds for food, grinding them into a [[flour]].  The [[bark]] was used for baskets and fabrics and the wood for [[firewood]] and building.  The leaves and [[Natural gum|gum]] were used as [[Herbalism|medicine]].\n\n[[Image:Ground squirrel mesquite.jpg|thumb|right|A round-tailed ground squirrel eating velvet mesquite pods]]\n\nThe range of the velvet mesquite has changed because of grazing.  [[Cattle]] not only [[Seed dispersal|dispersed]] mesquite seeds, but they also [[Overgrazing|overgrazed]] the land, resulting in fewer [[Wildfire|range fires]] to control the mesquite population.  Mesquites grew more densely and spread into what had been grassland.<ref name=\"fs\" />  Consequently, velvet mesquite is considered an [[invasive species]] or noxious weed in several states.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://plants.usda.gov/java/nameSearch?keywordquery=prosopis+velutina\n|title=PLANTS Profile for Prosopis velutina (velvet mesquite) | work=USDA PLANTS\n|accessdate=2008-05-01\n|last=\n|first=\n}}\n</ref>  However, mesquite [[bosque]]s cover only a small fraction of the area they covered before human settlement.  Agriculture, firewood cutting, housing developments, and the lowering of the [[water table]] have all contributed to the loss of native mesquite stands.<ref name=\"fs\" />\n\n==Uses==\n* Velvet mesquite is a common choice for residential and commercial [[xeriscaping]] in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], cities which are inside its natural range.  An established mesquite tree needs little or no watering, and is an attractive [[ornamental plant]].<ref>http://www.amwua.org/quick_search.html?type=&keyword=mesquite&x=0&y=0</ref>\n* Medicinal uses: Sore throats were treated with a hot tea made from a blend of the clear sap plus inner red [[bark]].  Stomachaches were treated with a tea made from the fresh leaves.  Toothache was treated by chewing the soft inner bark of the root.  For flagging appetite, a tea made from the dried leaves was taken before meals.<ref>Felger, R. S. and M. B. Moser, 1985,  ''People of the Desert and Sea.'' University of Arizona Press, Tucson, AZ.</ref>\n* Cosmetic uses: Most important to a select number of folks was mesquite's use against hair loss.   This treatment was used by men only, and consisted of the black sap that oozes from mesquite wounds (not the clear sap) mixed with other secret herbs and applied to the scalp.  Special mesquite herbal soap for \"macho\" hair is still available in parts of Mexico.<ref>Diaz, J. L.  1976.  ''Usos de las Plantas Medicinales de Mexico''.  Instituto Mexicano para el Estudio de las Plantas Medicinals, Mexico, D.F.</ref>\n* Bark was used for baskets and fabrics.\n* Wood is important for firewood and for flavor when grilling meat.\n\n==Food==\n<!-- {{Advert|section=y|date=March 2011}} -->\nMesquite pods are an important source of food for humans as well as native wildlife.  Pods are considered a slow-release food due to [[galactomannin]] gums which have been found to lower [[glycemic]] responses.  Their glycemic index is 25%, compared to 60% for sweet corn, and 100% for white sugar.\n\nDried and toasted, the pods are ground into mesquite meal and mesquite flour.  Both flour and meal are used to make cakes, breads, muffins, and pancakes.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mesquite Bosque]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|26em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=PRVE USDA Plant Profile for ''Prosopis velutina'' (velvet mesquite)]\n* [http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&search_value=26883  ITIS  Taxonomy Report]\n* [http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/provel/all.html Species information from the U.S. Forest Service]\n* [http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?query_src=photos_index&where-taxon=Prosopis+velutina Photographs from CalPhotos]\n*[http://seinet.asu.edu/seinet/symbiota/taxa/taxaprofile.php?taxon=Prosopis%20velutina&cl=Superstition%20Mountains%20Wilderness%20Area ''Prosopis velutina'' Pictures and herbarium specimen]\n{{commonscat|position=left|Prosopis velutina}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prosopis Velutina}}\n[[Category:Prosopis|velutina]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Sonoran Deserts]]\n[[Category:Flora of Arizona]]\n[[Category:Flora of New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Flora of Sonora]]\n[[Category:North American desert flora]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1898]]\n[[Category:Invasive plant species]]\n[[Category:Edible legumes]]\n[[Category:Forages]]\n[[Category:Plants used in Native American cuisine]]",

Leaves are 2\" to 5\" in length, ovate-lanceolate in shape, with finely toothed margins. Fall leaf color is yellow to red. Flowers are small, white and 5-petalled, in racemes 4\" to 6\" long which contain several dozen flowers. The flowers give rise to edible reddish-black \"berries\" ([[drupes]]).<ref name=\"NCCE\"/>\n\nA mature black cherry tree can easily be identified in a forest by its very broken, dark grey to black bark, which has the appearance of very thick, burnt cornflakes. However, for about the first decade or so of its life, the bark is thin, smooth, and banded, resembling that of a [[birch]]. It can also quickly be identified by its long, shiny leaves resembling those of a [[sourwood]], and by an almond-like odor released when a young twig is scratched and held close to the nose.<ref>This odor is the result of minute amounts of [[cyanide]] compounds produced and stored by the plant as a defense mechanism against [[herbivore]]s.

In the [[Midwest]], it is seen growing mostly in old fields with other sunlight-loving species, such as [[black walnut]], [[black locust]], and [[Celtis|hackberry]]. Gleason and Cronquist (1991) describe ''P. serotina'' as \"[f]ormerly a forest tree, now abundant as a weed-tree of roadsides, waste land, and forest-margins.\"<ref>Gleason, Henry A. and Arthur Cronquist.  1991.  \"Manual of Vascular Plants of Northeastern United States and Adjacent Canada, Second Edition.\"  The New York Botanical Garden.  Bronx, New York.  910 pp.</ref> It is a moderately long-lived tree, with ages of up to 258 years known, though it is prone to storm damage, with branches breaking easily; any decay resulting, however, only progresses slowly. Seed production begins around 10 years of age, but does not become heavy until 30 years and continues up to 100 years or more. Germination rates are high, and the seeds are widely dispersed by birds who eat the fruit and then excrete them. Some seeds however may remain in the [[Soil seed bank|soil bank]] and not germinate for as long as three years. All ''Prunus'' species have hard seeds that benefit from [[Scarification (botany)|scarification]] to germinate (which in nature is produced by passing through an animal's digestive tract).\n\n[[File:2014-11-02 11 47 15 Black Cherry foliage during autumn along Upper Ferry Road in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|thumb|right|Autumn foliage]]\n''P.&nbsp;serotina'' is also a host of [[caterpillar]]s of various [[Lepidoptera]] (see [[List of Lepidoptera which feed on Prunus|List of Lepidoptera which feed on ''Prunus'']]).

Removal is not always practical, though, because they often grow in very large numbers on farms, taking advantage of the light brought about by mowing and grazing. Entire fencerows can be lined with this poisonous tree, making it difficult to monitor all the branches falling into the grazing area. Black cherry is a leading cause of livestock illness, and grazing animals' access to it should be limited.\n\n== Uses ==\nThe fruit of  ''Prunus serotina'' is suitable for making [[jam]] and [[pie|cherry pies]],<ref>[http://www.cooks.com/rec/search/0,1-0,black_cherry_pie,FF.html Cooking, Recipes, and More.

The black cherry is commonly used instead of sweet cherries (''[[Prunus avium]]'') to achieve a sharper taste. It is also used in cakes which include dark chocolate, such as a [[Black Forest gateau]] and as garnishes for [[cocktail]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nThe wood of  ''Prunus&nbsp;serotina'' is also used for cooking and [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]] foods, where it imparts a unique flavor.\n\n''Prunus&nbsp;serotina'' [[timber]] is valuable; perhaps the premier [[cabinet (furniture)|cabinetry]] timber of the U.S., traded as \"cherry\".

Various cultivars have white, pink, or red flesh, and a few also feature red (instead of green or yellow) skin.\n\nWhen cultivated from seed, guavas are notable for an extremely slow growth rate for several months, before a very rapid acceleration in growth rate takes over. From seed, common guavas may bloom and set fruit in as few as two years or as many as eight. Cuttings and grafting are more commonly used as a propagation method in commercial groves. Highly adaptable, guavas can be easily grown as container plants in temperate regions, though their ability to bloom and set fruit is somewhat less predictable. In some tropical locations, guavas can become invasive. It has become a major problem in the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]].<ref>http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/SA/Ecuador/Galapagos/ScalesiaSantaCruz.htm</ref>\n\nThe plant is used in many different shampoo products for its scent.

Best quality guavas are obtained where low night temperatures, {{convert|10|C|F}}, prevail during winter. It tolerates high temperatures and drought conditions in North India during summers but it is susceptible to severe frost as it can kill the young plants. An annual rainfall of about {{convert|100|cm|abbr=on}} is sufficient during the rainy season (July\u2013September). The rains during harvesting period, however, deteriorate the quality of fruits.\n\nGuava is cultivated on varied types of soils- heavy clay to very light sandy soils.  Nevertheless, very good quality guavas are produced in river-basins. It tolerates a soil pH of 4.5-8.2. Maximum concentration of its feeding roots is available up to {{convert|25|cm|abbr=on}} soil depth. Thus the top soil should be quite rich to provide enough nutrients for accelerating new growth which bears fruits.\n\n==Varieties==\n[[File:Goiaba vermelha.jpg|thumb|left|Red guava ''Psidium guajava'']]\nThe varietals characteristics in guava are not as distinct as found in most other\nfruits. Its propagation through seeds reduces the distinctive characteristics of a variety in commercial cultivation. Important guava varieties are:\n\n;Lucknow 49\nAlso known as Sardar, its fruits are large, roundish ovate in shape, skin primrose yellow and pulp white, very sweet and tasty. The total soluble solids (TSS) and vitamin C contents are high. The trees are vigorous.\n\n;Allahabad Safeda\nThe most famous variety of Allahabad, it has acquired large variations due to seed propagation.  The fruits are large in size, round in shape, skin smooth and yellowish white.  The flesh is white, firm, soft having pleasant flavour, high TSS and vitamin C content.  The seeds are numerous, bold and hard. The trees are tall with profuse branching and broad crown. It can withstand drought conditions.<ref name=\"fruitipedia.com\">http://www.fruitipedia.com/guava.htm</ref>\n\n;Chittidar\nThe variety is very popular in western Uttar Pradesh.  The fruits are characterized by numerous red dots on the skin, high sweetness, and small and soft seeds. It is otherwise similar to Allahabad safeda fruits in size, shape and pulp. It has higher TSS content than Allahabad Safeda and Lucknow 49 but lower vitamin C content. The tree characters resemble to those of Allahabad Safeda.<ref name=\"fruitipedia.com\"/>\n\n;Harijha\nHarijha is more popular in Bihar because of profuse bearing.  The trees are of medium vigor due to sparse branching.  The fruit is round in shape, medium large in size and greenish yellow in color.  Flavor is sweet with good keeping quality.\n\n;Hafshi\nIt is a tasty, red- fleshed guava. It is mainly grown in Bihar. The fruit is moderately large and spherical in shape, with thin skin. Trees are of medium vigor but productive.\n\n;Apple guava\nIts fruits are medium-sized and pink colored. They are sweet in taste with good keeping quality. They require low temperature for the development of good pink color. The trees are of medium vigor but their leaves are greener than others. However, it is a moderate yielder.\n\n;Fruits of sebia\n(looking like apple) variety low temperature for the development of good pink color.  The trees are of medium vigour but their leaves are greener than others. However, it is a moderate yielder.\n\n;Seedless\nAll the seedless varieties viz. Saharanpur Seedless, Nagpur seedless and others, are the same. Two types of fruits, completely seedless and partly seeded, are borne on a plant of seedless variety. The completely seedless fruits develop on the shoots rising from the stem and these are bigger in size and irregular in shape. The partly seeded fruits are born on normal shoots at the periphery and are small in size and round in shape. Seedless variety is unfit for commercial cultivation because it gives very low yield. The plants are very vigorous.\n\n;Arka Mridula\nThis is a seedling selection of variety Allahabad Safeda.  Its medium-sized fruits are of excellent quality with high TSS. The white pulp has only few soft seeds. The plants are of medium vigor but high yielding.\n\n;[[Allahabadi Surkha]]\nThis is an outstanding variety of large, uniform pink fruits with deep pink flesh.  The plants produce up to {{convert|120|kg|abbr=on}} fruits in its sixth year of fruiting. The fruit is sweet, strongly flavored with few seeds and is slightly depressed at both ends. The plants are vigorous, dome shaped and compact.\n\n== Chemistry ==\nThe leaves of ''P. guajava'' contains the [[morin (flavonol)|flavonol morin]], [[morin-3-O-lyxoside]], [[morin-3-O-arabinoside]], [[quercetin]] and [[quercetin-3-O-arabinoside]].<ref>Bacteriostatic effect of flavonoids isolated from leaves of Psidium guajava on fish pathogens.

This tree may grow up to 60&nbsp;ft (18 meters) with a trunk diameter of 3.3&nbsp;ft (1 meter). It also contains fat branches and a spreading crown along with thick leaves. The thick leaves are about 3.2&nbsp;inches (13&nbsp;mm) long and evergreen. It grows very slowly once it has become mature, approximately 0.1&nbsp;inches per year in diameter.<ref name=jill/>\n\n* Bark: The color is light grayish. The bark is initially thin and lenticeled but later the bark becomes quite thick with shallow fissures and scaly ridges.<ref name=jill/>\n* Twig: Are medium sized. Colors can be light brown, fuzzy; reddish brown. Twigs also have pointy and fat clusters of terminal buds.<ref name=jill/>\n* Leaves: They are alternate, evergreen, simple, and oblong. The color is yellowish green or blueish green. Leaves are usually 1{{frac|1|2}} to 3{{frac|1|2}}&nbsp;inches long and they are usually entire or toothed margin. The texture of the leaves are leathery and stiff. The veins are parallel veins that are sunken above and raised beneath. The leaves also have round shaped base. The leaves may begin to shed in late winter or when new leaves begin emerging during spring.<ref name=jill/>\n* Fruits: Oblong acorn that is 1/2 to 1&nbsp;inch long. Acorns also caps that is shaped like a bowl that takes up 1/3 of the nut. The acorns usually mature around fall. The amount of acorns produced can also vary year to year, one year there may be about 32,000 acorns and the next year there may be very few. The germination of acorns is highly correlated with the amount of moisture during the rainy season.<ref name=jill/>\n* Flowers: They are monoecious, meaning that male and female organs are in different flowers on the same tree. Female flowers have small spike in the axils of the leaves. Males flowers are found in long drooping catkins that are yellowish green color.<ref name=jill>[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233501008 Flora of North America, ''Quercus arizonica'' Sargent, 1895.  Arizona oak ]</ref><ref>[http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/34567435#page/106/mode/1up Sargent, Charles Sprague 1895. Garden & Forest 8: 92-93]</ref>\n\n== Cultivation ==\nThe Arizona white oak can be found in a vast array of habitats such as savannas, grasslands, and chaparrals. They are usually found in mountain like areas that are above about 1675&nbsp;meters in elevation. Water use is low and it requires sun or part shade. Soil moisture must be dry and it must be rocky or sandy soils. Soils may be clay loam, clay, medium loam, or rocky. The Arizona white oak is both heat and cold tolerant.\n\n== Response to fires ==\n[[File:Quercus arizonica leaves 2.jpg|thumb|right|Underside of leaves]]\n\nWhen Arizona white oaks are small they usually die by fire. The acorns are usually killed by fires as well. The foliage is extremely flammable but larger trees usually survive fires that are not as severe and if a stump survives a fire it will sprout rapidly after its survival.\n\n== Threats ==\nThe wood decaying fungus ''[[Inonotus andersoni]]'' affects the Arizona white oak negatively. Burning and herbicide treatment has also affected the growth of the Arizona white oak, so they are being managed by pinyon-juniper silvicultural systems.\n\n== Uses ==\nThe wood is usually used for fuel. Since the wood of the Arizona white oak is hard, heavy, and strong, it is rarely used for commercial reasons such as furniture production.\n\nThe Arizona white oak is very important to livestock and wildlife because the acorns it produces provide food for cattle and other wildlife. It also provides cover for such animals like deer, turkeys, [[javelinas]], desert sheep, songbirds, and quail. The white tailed deer is also known to utilize it for cover. For white-tailed and mule deer, the Arizona white oak is highly palatable as well.\n\nThe Arizona white oak can also be used as an ornamental plant.\n\n{{commons}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n* [[Linden Oak]], possibly the largest living white oak in the United States\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/queari/all.html Pavek, Diane S. 1994.

This species is commonly found with many other species of the same genus ''[[Quercus]]'' such as ''Q. affinis'' and ''Q. lancifolia'', but is also found with members of different genera such as ''[[Fagus grandifolia]]'' (North American beech).<ref name=Valencia />\n\n==Morphology==\nIndividuals of this species are oak trees that grow up to {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall and have trunks {{convert|0.5|-|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=Valencia /> These oaks are often among the tallest trees in the wet montane forests.

They bear acorns as fruits and have pistillate flowers on a short {{convert|1.5|-|8|mm|2|adj=on}} stalk, which have 1 or 2 distal flowers.<ref name=Valencia />\n\n''Quercus delgadoana'' was determined as a new species because, unlike ''Q. eugeniifolia'' with fruit with [[Annual plant|annual]] maturation, this species has fruit with [[Biennial plant|biennial]] maturation. In addition, this new species can be distinguished from other similar species such as ''[[Quercus laurina|Q.&nbsp;laurina]]'' and ''Q.&nbsp;affinis'' because it has more secondary veins, a revolute blade margin, and an adaxial leaf surface without stellate [[trichome]]s.<ref name=Valencia />\n\n==Flowers and fruit==\nFlowers of ''Quercus delgadoana'' may develop in March, but only pistillate flowers can be observed; fruits with biennial maturation can be found in October and November. The fruits take two years to mature and are presented on the terminal twigs.<ref name=Valencia />\n\n==Conservation==\n''Quercus delgadoana'' was given a preliminary classification of Endangered (EN) according to the [[IUCN Red List]] criteria of 2001.<ref>IUCN. 2001. IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, Version 3.1. Prepared by the IUCN Species Survival Commission. IUCN, Gland, Switzerland, and Cambridge, United Kingdom.</ref> These forests are highly disturbed due to the extraction of firewood, the clearance of forest for pasture, and the establishment of coffee plantations. As a result, more than 50% of the population is expected to decline. In addition, the future loss of habitat is possible.<ref name=Valencia />\n\n==Etymology==\n''Quercus delgadoana'' is named after Alfonso Delgado Salinas, in recognition of his contributions to [[plant taxonomy]] and the encouragement and training he has given to many students in this field of study.<ref name=Valencia />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140627094911/http://www.iucnredlist.org/ IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]\n* [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120605172021.htm New plant and fungus species discovered]\n\n[[Category:Quercus|delgadoana]]\n[[Category:Endemic flora of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 2011]]",

It is an evergreen tree up to  10 meters tall with a trunk diameter over 40 centimeters. Leaves are thick and leathery, up to 15 cm long, with a few shallow rounded lobes.<ref name=evangelina/>\n\nIts scientific name is often misapplied to the NE Mexican and central [[Texas]] native Lacey Oak (''[[Quercus laceyi]]''), which has caused great confusion about the true identity of this species and the correct scientific name for the Lacey Oak. Although somewhat related, they do not share the same native range, with ''Q. glaucoides'' being endemic to Mexico, while ''Q. laceyi'' is native to both NE Mexico and central Texas, and ''Q. glaucoides'' is [[evergreen]], while ''Q. laceyi'' is [[deciduous]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080331105350/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Trans-Mexican_Volcanic_Belt_pine-oak_forests Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt Pine-Oak Forests containing ''Quercus glaucoides'']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120308074727/http://fm2.fieldmuseum.org/vrrc/max/FAGA-quer-glau-mex-2065950.jpg Mexican National Herbarium specimen of ''Quercus glaucoides'']\n\n[[Category:Quercus|glaucoides]]\n[[Category:Endemic flora of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1843]]\n[[Category:Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]]",

At higher elevations it is typically a large shrub. The trunk is up to 50 cm (20 inches) in diameter and  the bark is light gray and densely furrowed. The twigs are yellowish brown and hairless with reddish brown buds. The leaves are small, alternate and oblong, with entire margins, leathery, bluish-green above and mid green below. The flowers appear in spring at the same time as the old leaves are being shed and new leaf growth starts. The male flowers form yellowish-green catkins and the female flowers are solitary or paired and grow in the leaf axils. The light brown acorns are ovoid or oblong, about 2 cm (0.8 inch) long and lodged in scaly, bowl-shaped cups about one third the length of the nut.<ref name=FNA/><ref>[http://www.dendro.cnre.vt.edu/dendrology/syllabus2/factsheet.cfm?ID=627 Virginia Tech: Mexican blue oak] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509061003/http://www.dendro.cnre.vt.edu/dendrology/syllabus2/factsheet.cfm?ID=627 |date=May 9, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Habitat==\nThis oak is common at elevations of 1200 to 1800 meters (4000-6000 feet).

Some authors recognize as distinct species the forms others consider to be varieties of ''Quercus virginiana''. Notably, the following two taxa, treated as species in the ''Flora of North America'', are treated as varieties of southern live oak by the [[United States Forest Service]]: the [[Escarpment live oak]], ''[[Quercus fusiformis]]'' (''Q. virginiana'' var. ''fusiformis'') and\nthe [[Quercus geminata|sand live oak, ''Quercus geminata'' (''Q. virginiana'' var. ''geminata'')]].\n\nMatters are further complicated by southern live oaks [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridizing]] with both the above two species, and also with [[dwarf live oak]] (''Q. minima''), [[swamp white oak]] (''Q. bicolor''), [[Durand oak]] (''Q. durandii''), [[overcup oak]] (''Q. lyrata''), [[bur oak]] (''Q. macrocarpa''), and [[post oak]] (''Q. stellata'').\n\n==Range==\nLive oak can be found in the wild growing and reproducing on the lower coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic United States. Its native range begins on the extreme southeastern coast of Virginia, south in a narrow band along the ocean to the middle of the South Carolina coast, where its range begins to expand farther inland.  The range of live oak continues to expand inland as it moves south, growing across southern  Georgia and covering all of Florida south to the northernmost Florida Keys.  Live oak grows along the Florida panhandle to Mobile Bay, then westward across the southernmost two tiers of counties in Mississippi.  Live oak grows across the southern third of Louisiana, except for some barrier islands and scattered parts of the most southern parishes.  Live oak\u2019s range continues into Texas and narrows to hug the coast until just past Port Lavaca, Texas.<ref name=\"Trees_Florida\"/> The species reaches its northwestern limit in the granite [[massif]]s and canyons in [[Southwestern Oklahoma]], a rare remnant from the last [[glaciation]].\n\nAlong the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic United States, live oak is found in both single and mixed species forests, dotting the savannas, and as occasional clumps in the grasslands along the lower coastal plain. Live oak grows in soils ranging from heavy textures (clay loams), to sands with layers of organic materials or fine particles.  Live oak can be found dominating some maritime forests, especially where fire periodicity and duration are limited.  Live oak is found on higher topographic sites as well as hammocks in marshes and swamps. In general, southern live oak hugs the coastline and is rarely found more than 300 feet above sea level. Live oaks grow across a wide range of sites with many moisture regimes  \u2013  ranging from dry to moist. Live oak will survive well on both dry sites and in wet areas, effectively handling short duration flooding if water is moving and drainage is good.  Good soil drainage is a key resource component for sustained live oak growth. Required precipitation range is 40-65 inches of water per year, preferably in spring and summer.  Soil is usually acidic, ranging between pH of 5.5 and 6.5. The furthest north known live oak is in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] on Tyler Ave.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Shingle-oak-leaves-acorns.jpg|thumb|left|Leaves and acorns of a southern live oak]] <!-- it is not really a shingle oak, the file was misnamed. -Phr -->\n[[File:Century Tree.jpg|thumb|left|The Century Tree at [[Texas A&M University]] in [[College Station, Texas]]]]\nAlthough live oaks retain their leaves nearly year-round, they are not true evergreens. Live oaks drop their leaves immediately before new leaves emerge in the spring. Occasionally, [[Senescence|senescing]] leaves may turn yellow or contain brown spots in the winter, leading to the mistaken belief that the tree has [[oak wilt]], whose symptoms typically occur in the summer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plantclinic.tamu.edu/factsheets/live-oak/ |title=Live oak dropping leaves in early spring |work=Texas A&M AgriLife Extension |publisher=Texas A&M University |accessdate=April 14, 2015}}</ref> A live oak's defoliation may occur sooner in marginal climates or in dry or cold winters.<ref name=Trees_North_FL>{{Citation\n|last1=Kurz\n|first1=Herman\n|last2=Godfrey\n|first2=Robert K.\n|year=1962\n|title=Trees of Northern Florida\n|publisher=University Press of Florida\n|publication-place=Gainesville, Florida, USA\n|ISBN=978-0-8130-0666-6 \n|pages=103\u2013104\n}}</ref>\n\nThe bark is dark, thick, and furrowed longitudinally.

This, along with its low center of gravity and other factors, makes the southern live oak extremely resistant to strong sustained winds, such as those seen in hurricanes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/FR/FR17500.pdf |title= Selecting Tropical and Subtropical Tree Species For Wind Resistance |work=University of Florida IFAS Extension |publisher=University of Florida|accessdate= November 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe southern live oak responds \"with vigorous growth to plentiful moisture on well-drained soil.\"<ref name=Trees_North_FL/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://plants.usda.gov/java/charProfile?symbol=QUVI |title=Quercus virginiana Mill. live oak |work=Natural Resources Conservation Service |publisher=US Department of Agriculture|accessdate= August 8, 2013}}</ref> They tend to survive fire, because often a fire will not reach their [[crown (botany)|crowns]]. Even if a tree is burned, its crowns and roots usually survive the fire and sprout vigorously. Furthermore, live oak forests discourage entry of fire from adjacent communities because they provide dense cover that discourages the growth of a flammable understory.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} They can withstand occasional floods and hurricanes, and are resistant to salt spray and moderate soil salinity.  Although they grow best in well-drained sandy soils and loams, they will also grow in clay.<ref name=Phenology>[http://www.usanpn.org/Quercus_virginiana] \"The USA National Phenology Network &mdash; Quercus virginiana\", Retrieved 2011-07-06</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Oak alley - view from front.jpg|thumb|left|The avenue of live oaks at [[Oak Alley Plantation]] in [[Vacherie, Louisiana]], planted in the early 18th century.]]\n\nLive oak wood is hard, heavy, and difficult to work with, but very strong.  In the days of wooden ships, live oaks were the preferred source of the framework timbers of the ship, using the natural trunk and branch angles for their strength. The frame of {{USS|Constitution}} was constructed from southern live oak wood harvested from [[St. Simons Island, Georgia]], and the density of the wood grain allowed it to survive cannonade, thus earning it the nickname \"Old Ironsides\".

The tree crown is very dense, making it valuable for shade, and the species provides nest sites for many mammal species.

A large and attractive palm, it has been planted throughout the tropics and subtropics as an ornamental tree.  Although it is sometimes called ''R. elata'', the [[conserved name]] ''R. regia'' is now the correct name for the species.  Populations in [[Cuba]] and [[Florida]] were long seen as separate species, but are now considered to belong to a single species.\n\nBest known as an ornamental, ''R.&nbsp;regia'' is also used as a source of thatch, construction timber, and in some forms of so-called traditional medicine, although there is currently no valid scientific evidence to support the efficacy or use of any palm species for medicinal purposes.  The fruit is eaten by birds and bats (which disperse the seeds) and fed to livestock.  Its flowers are visited by birds and bats, and it serves as a roosting site and food source for a variety of animals.

[[Liberty Hyde Bailey]]'s use of the name in his 1949 revision of the genus, established its usage.<ref name = Zona1994/>\n\nHarper's new combination immediately supplanted Cook's ''R.&nbsp;floridana'', but there was disagreement as to whether Cuban and Floridian populations represented a single species or two species.  Zona's revision of the genus concluded that they both belonged to the same species.  According to the rules of botanical nomenclature, the correct name of the species should have been ''Roystonea elata''.  Zona pointed out, however, that the name ''R.&nbsp;regia'' (or ''Oreodoxa regia'') has a history of use in horticulture that dated from at least 1838, and that the species had been propagated around the world under that name.  ''Roystonea elata'', on the other hand, had only been used since 1949, and was used much less widely.  On that basis, Zona proposed that the name ''Roystonea regia'' should be conserved.<ref name = Zona1994/>\n\n===Common names===\nIn cultivation,  ''Roystonea regia'' is called the Cuban royal palm or simply the royal palm.

''drummondii'' are never winged.\n\nThe inflorescence are dense terminal panicles of small white flowers 6&nbsp;in. to 10&nbsp;in (15&nbsp;cm to 20&nbsp;cm) long. Flowering occurs in May\u2013June for var. ''drummondii'' and in November for var. ''saponaria''.\n\nThe fruit occur in large pyramidal clusters at the ends of branches.

The leaves are also used to [[Abortifacient|induce]] [[abortion]], while a [[poultice]] made from crushed leaves is used for [[hemorrhoid]]s and [[scrofula]]. Heated leaves are applied to the forehead as an [[analgesic]] for [[headache]]s and a leaf [[decoction]] is used for [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]]. A [[root]] decoction is used to treat [[dysentery]], [[fever]], [[diarrhea]], [[Digestion|digestive]] problems, and violent body pains. The root bark is used as an [[anti-inflammatory]] and to treat [[arthritis]]. In [[West Africa]], a decoction made from the leaves is used to treat [[leprosy]], [[sexually-transmitted disease]]s, and [[malaria]] due to its [[laxative]] and [[diuretic]] effects.<ref name=\"Gurib-Fakim\"/> \n\n===Non-medicinal===\nThe leaves are used in the [[Philippines]] to clean [[Fat|grease]] from dishes. The berries are [[Toxin|toxic]] to humans, causing [[headache]], [[cramp]]s, and [[nausea]], but are cooked and eaten in [[Southeast Asia]] and made into [[curry]] in [[South Indian cuisine|southern India]]. They are a component of [[arrow poison]] in [[Tropical Asia]].

The young leaves, which taste slightly bitter and sour, are sometimes served raw together with certain types of ''[[nam phrik]]'' (Thai chilli pastes). It is also served with chilli powder in [[Bangladesh]] where the fruit is known as ''am\u1e5ba''.\n\nAs a member of the Sumac family (Anacardiaceae), exposure to the sap of this species may result in an identical allergic reaction to that of the [[Toxicodendron radicans|poison ivy]] plant. Those with a known sensitivity to [[urushiol]] should exercise caution in consuming or handling this species.\n\n==Use in Medicine==\n{{Refimprove|date=December 2015}}\nThe fruit-juice is used as a [[febrifuge]] and diuretic. The roots are well-known febrifuge on the [[Ivory Coast]], being sometimes used with leaves of [[Ximenia]], [[Premna hispida]], Ficus sp., and [[Alchornea]]. They are pulped, boiled in water, and drunk, or used as a lotion or for baths. The bark is used as a purgative and in local applications for leprosy (Kerharo and Bouquet). The bark decoction is used for severe cough, causing relief through vomiting. The dry pulverized bark is applied as a dressing to the circumcision wound. The bark contains a certain amount of tannin. A decoction of the mashed leaves is used by the [[Igbo people|Ibos]] ([[Nigeria]]) for washing a swollen face. The leaves, ground with sugar, are rubbed on the mouth and gums. A leaf infusion is a common cough remedy or used as a laxative for fever with constipation. A leaf decoction is used for [[gonorrhea]]. The leaves with the leaves of [[Vitex quinata]] and [[Terminalia avicennoides]], are used on the Ivory Coast for fresh wounds preventing inflammation. All these leaves are used for [[leprosy]]. Crushed with lemon they are effective for worms in children. With [[Alchornea]] leaves and lemon a gargle is made from the leaves. They are crushed to obtain the juice. A decoction of pounded leaves is used as an eye lotion and the juice pressed from young, warm leaves is given to children for stomach troubles. The young leaves are used as an infusion taken internally or as a warm astringent lotion by women in confinement in [[Sierra Leone]]. In the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] the young leaves pounded to a frothy pulp are used as a bed for paralytics, who are then massaged with them to the accompaninent of incantations.<ref>Woody Plants of Ghana.

In Surinam the fruit is called '''''Mope'''''. In [[Brazil]], the fruit is known by several different names, such as '''''caj\u00e1''''', '''''tapereb\u00e1''''' and '''''ambal\u00f3'''''. In [[Peru]], it is known as '''''uvos''''' or '''''mango ciruelo'''''. In [[Ghana]], it is hog plum or '''''Ashanti plum'''''. It is called \"Akukor\" in the Ewe language of Ghana. In [[Nigeria]], the fruit is called '''''Iyeye''''' or '''''Yeye''''' in the [[Yoruba language]],<ref>See Ayoka ''et al.'' (2008, p.130), Oladele (2008, p.5).

It is one of three species in the genus ''[[Swietenia]]'', all three of which are regarded as \"genuine mahogany.\" At {{Convert|6|m|ft}}, it is one-fifth the height of ''S. mahagoni'' and one-sixth the height of ''S. macrophylla''. Its species name, ''humilis'', means \"small\" or \"dwarfish\".\n\nCommon names include '''Pacific Coast mahogany''', '''''caoba del Pacifico''''', '''''caoba del Honduras''''', '''''caobilla''''', '''''cobano''''', '''''gateado''''', '''''sopilocuahuilt''''', '''''venadillo''''' and '''''zapaton'''''. In the wood trades it is known as '''Honduras mahogany''' and '''Mexican mahogany'''.\n\nThe tree has been over-exploited for its wood which is valuable for making furniture. The plant also is of interest as a possibly commercial source of seed oil and pharmacologically active compounds.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe area of natural distribution is the drier zones of the western Sierra Madre mountain range from Mexico through Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador. The distribution in Guatemala and Honduras bulges eastward from the Pacific Coast nearly to the Atlantic Ocean. In Honduras it also extends from the western Sierra Madre into the abutting northern Nicaraguan cordillera range. The northern half of the Pacific Coast of Costa Rica includes {{sp|S.|humilis}} habitat. It is found at altitudes up to {{Convert|1200|m|ft}}. Its habitat is both wet and dry deciduous forest, savanna, rough scrub, rocky hillsides and cultivated fields. The species having been over-exploited, surviving trees usually are scattered and isolated individuals. Large specimens are rare.\n\n==International legal protection==\nThe multilateral treaty CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) lists ''S. humilis'' in Appendix II (all parts and derivatives except seeds). Also it is categorized in the IUCN ([[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]) Red List of Threatened Species as Vulnerable (Version 2011.2).\n\n==Biologically active compounds==\n\n===Poison===\nThe bark and seeds possess an alkaloid reputed to be very poisonous. Extracts significantly inhibited the growth and feeding of third instar larvae of ''Tenebrio molitor'' ([[mealworms]]). They also have shown effectiveness against larvae of '[[Ostrinia nubilalis]]'', the European Corn borer, and ''[[Spodoptera frugiperda]]'', the Fall Armyworm.<ref name=\"PHCVAA\">Perez-Rubio, V.

Pharmacological studies of the seeds and bark have been ongoing since the 1990s.\n\n===Seed oil===\nAlthough the seed is poisonous, the tree shows promise as a source of seed oil with characteristics resembling those of avocado and sunflower oils. The seed germ yields about 45% of edible oil by mass. Of this yield, the fatty acid proportions are about 18% saturated (mainly palmitic and stearic), 30% monounsaturated (mainly oleic), and 48% polyunsaturated (mainly linoleic and linolenic). It also might be of commercial interest as a component of cosmetics and pesticides.<ref name=\"PHCVAA\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Zuccarini, Joseph Gerhard. Abh. Akad.

The name '''Roble de Sabana''', meaning \"savannah oak\", is widely used in [[Costa Rica]] in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], probably because it often remains in heavily deforested areas, where people appreciate its intense flowering periods and because of the resemblance of its wood to that of oak trees.<ref name=\"HernanRodriguez\">Hernan Rodriguez Navas. 2007.  La Utilidad de las Plantas Medicinales en Costa Rica. EUNA, Heredia, Costa Rica. 213pp.</ref> It is the [[national tree]] of [[El Salvador]], where it is called \"Maquil\u00edshuat\".\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThis species is distributed from southern [[M\u00e9xico]], to [[Venezuela]] and [[Ecuador]]. It has been found growing from [[sealevel]] to {{Convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, in [[temperature]]s ranging from 20&nbsp;\u00b0C to 30&nbsp;\u00b0C on average, with annual [[rainfall]] above 500&nbsp;mm, and on soils with very variable [[pH]].\n\nThe tree crown is wide, with irregular, stratified [[Ramification (botany)|ramification]] and only few thick branches. The bark can be gray to brown, in varying darkness and may be vertically fissured. [[Leaf|Leaves]] are [[Leaf#Divisions of the blade|compound]], [[Leaf shape|digitate]] and [[deciduous]]. Each leaf has five [[leaflet (botany)|leaflets]] of variable size, the middle one being the largest. Flowering occurs mainly  in January and February, and is generally associated with dry periods; although flowering has also been observed in August, September, April and May. Flowers are large, in various tones of pink to purple, and appear while the tree has none, or very few, leaves. [[Pollination]] occurs probably by insects, although the flowers are visited by many birds such as [[tanager]]s, [[hummingbird]]s and [[New World oriole|orioles]]. The long and slender fruit capsules can measure up to {{Convert|35|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and appear from February through April. After the drying fruit [[Dehiscence (botany)|dehisces]], the anemochorous, [[hyaline]]-[[Biological membrane|membrane]]-[[Seed dispersal#Wind|winged]] seeds are released. There are an average of 45,000 seeds per [[kg]] with up to 13% water content. [[Germination]] of seeds is extremely easy and efficient, reaching almost 100%. It is a fairly fast growing tree{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.\n\nThis tree is often seen in [[Neotropic]]al cities, where it is often planted in parks and gardens.  In the rainy season it offers great shade{{Or|date=August 2011}} and, in the dry season, abundant flowers are present on the defoliated trees.\n\n== Medicinal uses ==\nPreparations of the cortex of the tree are consumed to eliminate intestinal parasites, malaria and uterine cancer.  A decoction of the cortex is recommended for anemia and constipation. A decoction of the flowers, leaves and roots has been used to reduce fevers and pain, cause sweating, to treat tonsil inflammation and various other disorders.<ref name=\"HernanRodriguez\" />\n\nAmong the various active phytochemicals in the tree is [[lapachol]], a natural [[organic compound]] isolated from various other ''Tabebuia'' species.<ref>Record, Samuel J.

The genus '''''Tamarindus''''' is a [[monotypic taxon]], having only a single species.\n\nThe tamarind tree produces pod-like [[fruit]]s, which contain an  edible pulp that is used extensively in cuisines around the world. Other uses of the pulp include traditional medicine and metal polish. The wood can be used for woodworking, and an [[Tamarind seed oil|oil]] can be extracted from the seeds. Because of the tamarind's many uses, cultivation has spread around the world in tropical and subtropical zones.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name derives from {{lang-ar|\u062a\u0645\u0631 \u0647\u0646\u062f\u064a}}, [[Romanization of Arabic|romanized]] ''tamar hindi'', \"Indian [[Date palm#Dates|date]]\".

Tamarind heartwood is reddish brown, sometimes with a purplish hue. The heartwood in tamarind tends to be narrow and is usually only present in older and larger trees. The pale yellow sapwood is sharply demarcated from the heartwood. Heartwood is said to be durable to very durable in decay resistance, and is also resistant to insects. Its sapwood is not durable and is prone to attack by insects and fungi as well as [[spalting]]. Due to its density and interlocked grain, tamarind is considered difficult to work. Heartwood has a pronounced blunting effect on cutting edges. Tamarind turns, glues, and finishes well. The heartwood is able to take a high natural polish.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tamarind|url=http://www.wood-database.com/tamarind/|website=The Wood Database|accessdate=22 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Metal polish===\nIn homes and temples, especially in [[Buddhist]] Asian countries, the fruit pulp is used to polish brass shrine statues and lamps, and copper, brass, and bronze utensils.

Some mixtures included [[maize]], [[Capsicum|chili]], [[vanilla]] (''Vanilla planifolia''), and honey. [[Archaeological]] evidence for use of cacao, while relatively sparse, has come from the recovery of whole cacao beans at [[Uaxactun]], [[Guatemala]]<ref>Kidder (1947).</ref> and from the preservation of wood fragments of the cacao tree at [[Belize]] sites including [[Cuello]] and [[Pulltrouser Swamp (Maya site)|Pulltrouser Swamp]].<ref>Hammond and Miksicek (1981); Turner and Miksicek (1984).</ref> In addition, analysis of residues from ceramic vessels has found traces of [[theobromine]] and [[caffeine]] in early formative vessels from Puerto Escondido, Honduras (1100\u2013900 BC) and in middle formative vessels from [[Colha, Belize]] (600\u2013400 BC) using similar techniques to those used to extract chocolate residues from four classic period (around 400 AD) vessels from a tomb at the Maya archaeological site of [[Rio Azul]]. As cacao is the only known commodity from Mesoamerica containing both of these [[alkaloid]] compounds, it seems likely these vessels were used as containers for cacao drinks. In addition, cacao is named in a [[hieroglyph]]ic text on one of the Rio Azul vessels. Cacao was also believed to be ground by the Aztecs and mixed with tobacco for smoking purposes.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Currency system===\nCacao beans constituted both a ritual beverage and a major [[currency]] system in [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations.  At one point, the Aztec empire received a yearly tribute of 980 loads (''xiquipil'' in Nahuatl) of cacao, in addition to other goods.  Each load represented exactly 8,000 beans.<ref>J.

[[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s|Cort\u00e9s]] and others noted the vast quantities of this beverage the Aztec emperor consumed, and how it was carefully whipped by his attendants beforehand. Examples of cacao beans, along with other agricultural products, were brought back to Spain at that time, but it seems the beverage made from cacao was introduced to the Spanish court in 1544 by Kekchi Maya nobles brought from the New World to Spain by [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]]s to meet [[Philip II of Spain|Prince Philip]].<ref>(Coe and Coe 1996)</ref> Within a century, the culinary and [[medical]] uses of chocolate had spread to France, England and elsewhere in [[Western Europe]].

About 1,200 seeds (40 pods) are required to produce 1&nbsp;kg (2.2&nbsp;lb) of [[chocolate liquor|cocoa paste]].\n\nHistorically, chocolate makers have recognized three main [[cultivar|cultivar groups]] of cacao beans used to make cocoa and chocolate.<ref>[http://www.xocoatl.org/variety.htm All about Chocolate -- Varieties]</ref> The most prized, rare, and expensive is the Criollo group, the cocoa bean used by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. Only 10% of chocolate is made from Criollo, which is arguably less bitter and more aromatic than any other bean. The cacao bean in 80% of chocolate is made using beans of the Forastero group, the main and most ubiquitous variety being the Amenolado variety, while the arriba variety (such as the Nacional variety that was recently discovered) are less commonly found in Forestero produce. Forastero trees are significantly hardier and more disease-resistant than Criollo trees, resulting in cheaper cacao beans. Trinitario, a hybrid of Criollo and Forastero, is used in about 10% of chocolate. The criollo cacao beans from [[Chuao]] in [[Aragua]], [[Venezuela]], are widely regarded as some of the finest in the world. In November 2000, the cacao beans coming from said region were awarded an appellation of origin under the title \"Cacao de Chuao\" (from Spanish-''cacao of Chuao'')<ref>http://www.wipo.int/ipadvantage/en/details.jsp?id=2618</ref> effectively making this one of the most expensive and sought-after types of cacao.\n\nA new, genetically based classification of 10 groups<ref name=\"Juan C. Motamayor, Philippe Lachenaud, Jay Wallace da Silva e Mota, Rey Loor, David N. Kuhn, J. Steven Brown, Raymond J. Schnell 2008\"/> may well help breeders to create new varieties that are both pest- and disease-resistant and contain valued flavours.\n\nMajor [[cocoa bean]] processors include [[The Hershey Company|Hershey's]], [[Nestl\u00e9]] and [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]], all of which purchase cocoa beans via various sources.\n\nIn June 2009, Mars Botanicals, a division of Mars, launched Cirku, a cocoa extract product that provides cocoa \ufb02avanols made with a patented process that contains a high level of phytonutrients.<ref>[http://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/ Cocoa-derived Cirku launched for better circulation]</ref>\n\nChocolate can be made from ''T. cacao'' through a process of steps that involve harvesting, fermenting of ''T. cacao'' pulp, drying, harvesting, and then extraction.<ref name=\"Zzaman\">{{Cite journal|last=Zzaman|first=Wahidu|last2=Bhat|first2=Rajeev|last3=Yang|first3=Tajul Aris|last4=Mat Easa|first4=Azhar|date=2017-03-02|title=Influences of superheated steam roasting on changes in sugar, amino acid and flavor active components of cocoa bean (Theobroma cacao)|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28251656|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|doi=10.1002/jsfa.8302|issn=1097-0010|pmid=28251656}}</ref> Roasting ''T. cacao'' by using superheated steam was found to be better than conventional roasting (use of ovens) because it resulted in same quality of cocoa beans in a shorter amount of time.<ref name=\"Zzaman\"/>\n\n==Pests==\n{{See also|List of cacao diseases}}\nVarious plant pests and diseases can cause serious problems for cacao production.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cocoa Crop Protection|url=http://www.dropdata.org/cocoa/|accessdate=9 November 2012}}</ref>\n*[[Insect]]s\n**Cocoa [[Miridae|mirids or capsids]] worldwide (but especially ''[[Sahlbergella singularis]]'' and ''[[Distantiella theobroma]]'' in [[West Africa]] and ''[[Helopeltis]]'' spp. in [[Southeast Asia]])\n**''[[Conopomorpha cramerella]]'' (cocoa pod borer - in [[Southeast Asia]])\n*[[Fungus|Fungi]]\n**''[[Moniliophthora roreri]]'' (frosty pod rot)\n**''[[Moniliophthora perniciosa]]'' (witches' broom)\n**''[[Ceratocystis cacaofunesta]]'' (''mal de machete'') or (''Ceratocystis'' wilt)\n**''[[Verticillium dahliae]]''\n**''[[Oncobasidium theobromae]]'' (vascular streak dieback)\n*[[Oomycete]]s\n**''Phytophthora'' spp. (black pod) especially ''[[Phytophthora megakarya]]'' in West Africa\n*[[Virus]]es\n**[[CSSV]]\n* [[Mistletoe]]\n*[[Rat]]s and other [[vertebrate]] pests ([[squirrel]]s, [[woodpecker]]s, ''etc.'')\n\n==Conservation==\nThe pests and diseases to which cacao is subject, along with climate change, mean that new varieties will be needed to respond to these challenges. Breeders rely on the genetic diversity conserved in field [[genebank]]s to create new varieties, because cacao has [[recalcitrant seed]]s that cannot be stored in a conventional genebank.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cacao Collections|url=https://sites.google.com/a/cgxchange.org/cacaonet/cacao-genebanks|publisher=CacaoNet|accessdate=9 November 2012}}</ref> In an effort to improve the diversity available to breeders, and ensure the future of the field genebanks, experts have drawn up A Global Strategy for the Conservation and Use of Cacao Genetic Resources, as the Foundation for a Sustainable Cocoa Economy.<ref>[https://sites.google.com/a/cgxchange.org/cacaonet/cacaonet-global-strategy A Global Strategy for the Conservation and Use of Cacao Genetic Resources, as the Foundation for a Sustainable Cocoa Economy]</ref> The strategy has been adopted by the cacao producers and their clients, and seeks to improve the characterization of cacao diversity, the sustainability and diversity of the cacao collections, the usefulness of the collections, and to ease access to better information about the conserved material. Some natural areas of cacao diversity are protected by various forms of conservation, for example national parks. However, a recent study of genetic diversity and predicted climates<ref name=\"Thomas e47676\"/> suggests that many of those protected areas will no longer be suitable for cacao by 2050. It also identifies an area around [[Iquitos]] in [[Peru]] that will remain suitable for cacao and that is home to considerable genetic diversity, and recommends that this area be considered for protection.\n\nPhytopathogens (parasitic organisms) cause much damage to ''Theobroma cacao'' plantations around the world. Many of those phytopathogens, which include many of the pests named above, were analyzed using mass spectrometry and allow for guiding on the correct approaches to get rid of the specific phytopathogens.

There are no known [[cultivar]]s of this taxon, nor is it known to be in commerce.\n\n==Uses==\nAlthough much of its natural range is threatened by deforestation, the tree is singularly unpopular in the timber trade on account of its deeply fluted trunk, and thus not considered a threatened species. The timber is hard and heavy (Gs 0.55), but difficult to dry, and can warp badly. Moreover, its high silica content (0.35) damages tools. The wood is used for tools, furniture, and floors, whilst the foliage is commonly used as fodder for cattle.

The common name of \"bullhorn\" refers to the enlarged, hollowed-out, swollen thorns (technically called '''stipular spines''') that occur in pairs at the base of leaves, and resemble the horns of a steer. In [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]] (one region where the bullhorn acacia thrives) it is called \"sub\u00edn\", in [[Panam\u00e1]] the locals call them \"cachito\" (little horn). The tree grows to a height of {{convert|10|m|ft}}. The Vachellia cornigera is typically found in woodland and great plains.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n== Mutualistic Symbiosis ==\n[[File:Pseudomyrmex ferruginea Ryan Somma.jpg|thumb|left|Acacia ants]]\nBullhorn Acacia is best known for its [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with a species of ''[[Pseudomyrmex]]'' [[ant]] (''[[Pseudomyrmex ferruginea]]'') that lives in its hollowed-out thorns. Unlike other acacias, Bullhorn acacias are deficient in the bitter [[alkaloid]]s usually located in the leaves that defend against ravaging insects and animals. Bullhorn acacia ants fulfil that role.\n\nThe ants act as a defense mechanism for the tree, protecting it against harmful insects, animals or humans that may come into contact with it. The ants live in the hollowed-out thorns for which the tree is named. In return, the tree supplies the ants with [[protein]]-[[lipid]] nodules called [[Beltian body|Beltian bodies]] from its leaflet tips and [[carbohydrate]]-rich nectar from [[gland]]s on its leaf stalk. These Beltian bodies have no known function other than to provide food for the [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] ants. The aggressive ants release an alarm [[pheromone]] and rush out of their thorn \"barracks\" in great numbers.\n\nAccording to [[Daniel Janzen]], [[livestock]] can apparently smell the [[pheromone]] and avoid these acacias day and night.<ref>Daniel Janzen, [[Costa Rica]]n Natural History, 1983</ref> Getting stung in the mouth and tongue is an effective deterrent to browsing on the tender foliage. In addition to protecting ''V. conigera'' from [[leaf-cutting ant]]s and other unwanted [[herbivore]]s, the ants also clear away invasive seedlings around the base of the tree that might overgrow it and block out vital sunlight.\n\n==Uses==\n=== Decorative uses ===\nThe [[Spine (botany)|thorn]]s of ''V. cornigera'', are often strung into unusual necklaces and belts. In [[El Salvador]] the horn-shaped thorns provide the legs for small ballerina seed dolls which are worn as decorative pins.\n\n=== Traditional medicine ===\nThe thorns of ''V. cornigera'' are also used in traditional [[Maya peoples|Maya]] [[acupuncture]].<ref name=\"Saqui\">{{cite book|last1=Saqui|first1=Aurora Garcia|title=Ix Hmen U Tzaco Ah Maya: Maya Herbal Medicine|date=2016|publisher=Produccicones de la Hamaca|location=Caye Caulker, Belize|isbn=9768142863|page=42}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<References/>\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons}}\n{{Wikispecies|Vachellia cornigera}}\n*[http://www.ambergriscaye.com/fieldguide/bzplants.html Vegetation of Belize]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060214094354/http://arnica.csustan.edu:80/biol1010/com_ecology/community_ecology.htm Community Ecology]\n*[http://www.backyardnature.net/yucatan/acacia-t.htm Backyard Nature]\n\n[[Category:Vachellia|cornigera]]\n[[Category:Trees of Belize]]\n[[Category:Trees of Central America]]\n[[Category:Trees of Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Trees of Cuba]]\n[[Category:Trees of El Salvador]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guadeloupe]]\n[[Category:Trees of \u00celes des Saintes]]\n[[Category:Trees of Martinique]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Trees of Panama]]\n[[Category:Medicinal plants of Central America]]\n[[Category:Myrmecophytes]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]",
