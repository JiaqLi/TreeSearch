In [[Canada]] it is commonly known as [[Manitoba]] maple and occasionally as elf maple. '''Box elder''', '''boxelder maple''', '''ash-leaved maple''', and '''maple ash''' are its most common names in the [[United States]]; in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] it is also known as '''ashleaf maple'''.<ref name=BSBI07>{{cite web|title=BSBI List 2007 |publisher=Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland |url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |format=xls |access-date=2014-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VqJ46atN?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bsbi.org.uk%2FBSBIList2007.xls |archivedate=2015-01-25 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Common names ==\n\nIndicative of its familiarity to many people over a large geographic range, ''A. negundo'' has numerous common names.\n\nThe names \"box elder\" and \"boxelder maple\" are based upon the similarity of its whitish wood to that of [[Buxus|boxwood]] and the similarity of its [[pinnate]]ly compound leaves to those of some species of [[Sambucus|elder]].<ref>[http://www.depauw.edu/univ/naturepark/natural_history/trees/aceraceae/acer_negundo.htm DePauw University]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>   This is the only North American maple with compound leaves, though several Asian species also have them.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book | last=Keeler | first=H. L. | title=Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them | publisher=Charles Scriber's Sons | year=1900 | location=New York | pages=85\u201387 }}</ref>\n\nOther common names are based upon this maple's similarity to [[Fraxinus|ash]], its preferred environment, its [[maple syrup|sugary sap]], a description of its leaves, its [[binomial name]], and so on.  These names include (but are not limited to) ash-, cut-, or three-leaf (or -leaved) maple; ash maple; sugar ash; Negundo maple; and river maple.<ref>[http://www.windsorplywood.com/ Acer spp. Aceraceae] Note that some of the common names given in this reference are questionable.  \"stinking ash\" and \"black ash\" typically refer to ''[[Ptelea trifoliata]]'' and ''[[Fraxinus nigra]]'', respectively.  This reference is retained as an example of the confusion which arises when plants such as ''A. negundo'' are discussed by other than their [[scientific name]]s.</ref>  In [[Canada]] it is commonly known as Manitoba maple and occasionally as elf maple.<ref>[http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/index/commtreesprairies/manitobamaple Community trees of the Prairie provinces&nbsp;\u2013 Canadian Forest Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  In [[Russia]] it is called American maple ({{lang-rus|\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0451\u043d|amerikansky klyon}})<!-- [[Wikipedia:Romanization of Russian]] --> as well as ash-leaf maple ({{lang-rus|\u043a\u043b\u0451\u043d \u044f\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0301\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439|klyon yasenelistny}}), and in Italian ''acero americano''.<ref>[http://luirig.altervista.org/flora/taxa/index2.php?scientific-name=acer+negundo Altervista Italiana, Acero americano, ''Acer negundo'' L.]</ref>\n\nCommon names may also designate a particular [[subspecies]].  For example, a common name for ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''interius'' may be preceded by \"inland\" (as in \"inland boxelder maple\").  A common name for ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''californicum'' may be preceded by \"California\" or \"western\".\n\n[[File:2014-10-11 12 48 07 Box Elder Maple foliage during autumn in Elko, Nevada.JPG|thumb|left|Autumn leaf color]]\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Acer negundo bark-Clapiers~2010 04 05.jpg|thumb|left|Bark of a young ''Acer negundo''.]]\n''Acer negundo'' is a usually fast-growing and fairly short-lived [[tree]] that grows up to {{convert|10|-|25|m|ft|round=5|sp=us}} tall, with a trunk diameter of {{convert|30|-|50|cm|in|0|sp=us}}, rarely up to {{convert|1|m|ft|sp=us}} diameter.  It often has several trunks and can form impenetrable thickets.<ref name=\"gelderen\">van Gelderen, C.J. & van Gelderen, D.M. (1999). ''Maples for Gardens: A Color Encyclopedia''.</ref>\n\nThe shoots are green, often with a whitish to pink or violet [[wax]]y coating when young.  Branches are smooth, somewhat brittle, and tend to retain a fresh green colour rather than forming a [[bark]] of dead, protective tissue.  The bark on its trunks is pale gray or light brown, deeply cleft into broad ridges, and scaly.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nUnlike most other maples (which usually have [[simple leaf|simple]], [[palmate]]ly [[lobed leaf|lobed]] [[leaf|leaves]]), ''Acer negundo'' has [[pinnate]]ly [[compound leaf|compound]] leaves that usually have three to seven leaflets.  Simple leaves are also occasionally present;  technically, these are single-leaflet compound leaves.  Although some other maples (such as ''[[Acer griseum]]'', ''[[Acer mandshuricum]]'' and the closely related [[Acer cissifolium|''A. cissifolium'']]) have [[leaf shape|trifoliate]] leaves, only ''A. negundo'' regularly displays more than three leaflets.\n\nThe leaflets are about {{convert|5|-|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}} long and {{convert|3|-|7|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} wide with slightly serrate margins.  Leaves have a [[translucence|translucent]] light green color and turn yellow in the [[Autumn|fall]].\n\nThe [[flower]]s are small and appear in early spring on drooping [[raceme]]s {{convert|10|-|20|cm|in|0|sp=us}} long.  The [[fruit]]s are paired [[Samara (fruit)|samaras]], each seed slender, {{convert|1|-|2|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long, with a {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} incurved wing; they drop in autumn or they may persist through winter.  Seeds are usually both prolific and [[fertility|fertile]].\n\nUnlike most other maples, ''A. negundo'' is fully [[dioecious]] and both a male and female tree are needed for either to reproduce.\n\n* Winter buds: Terminal buds acute, an eighth of an inch long.  Lateral buds obtuse.  The inner scales enlarge when spring growth begins and often become an inch long before they fall.\n* Flowers: April, before the leaves, yellow green; staminate flowers in clusters on slender hairy pedicels one and a half to two inches long.  Pistillate flowers in narrow drooping racemes.\n* Calyx: Yellow green; staminate flowers campanulate, five-lobed, hairy.  Pistillate flowers smaller, five-parted; disk rudimentary.\n* Corolla: Wanting.\n* Stamens: Four to six, exserted; filaments slender, hairy; anthers linear, connective pointed.\n* Pistil: Ovary hairy, borne on disk, partly enclosed by calyx, two-celled, wing-margined.  Styles separate at base into two stigmatic lobes.\n* Fruit: Maple keys, full size in early summer.  Borne in drooping racemes, pedicels one to two inches long.  Key an inch and a half to two inches long, nutlets diverging, wings straight or incurved.  September.  Seed half an inch long.  Cotyledons, thin, narrow.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\n=== Subspecies ===\n[[File:Acer negundo.jpg|thumb|right|''A. negundo'' leaves and fruits]]\n\n''Acer negundo'' is often discussed as comprising three subspecies, each of which was originally described as a separate species.  These are:\n\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''negundo'' is the main variety and the type to which characteristics described in the article most universally apply.  Its natural range is from the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] to the Rocky Mountains.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''interius'' has more leaf serration than the main species and a more [[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]] leaf surface.  As the name ''interus'' indicates, its natural range of [[Saskatchewan]] to [[New Mexico]] is sandwiched between that of the other two subspecies.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''californicum'' has larger leaves than the main species.  Leaves also have a velvety texture which is essential to distinguish it from ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''negundo''.  It is found in parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]].<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n\nSome authors further subdivide subsp. ''negundo'' into a number of regional varieties but these intergrade and their maintenance as distinct [[taxa]] is disputed by many.  Even the differences between recognized subspecies are probably a matter of gradient [[speciation]].\n\nFinally, note that a few botanists treat boxelder maple as its own distinct genus (''Negundo aceroides'') but this is not widely accepted.\n\n== Distribution ==\nAs noted, varieties thrive across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It may also be found as far south as [[Guatemala]].\n\nAlthough native to [[North America]], it is considered an [[invasive species]] in some areas of that continent. It can quickly [[colonize]] both cultivated and uncultivated areas and the range is therefore expanding both in North America and elsewhere. In Europe where it was introduced in 1688 as a park tree it is able to spread quickly in places and is considered an invasive species in parts of Central Europe (Germany and the Czech Republic, middle Danube, Vistula river valley in Poland) where it can form mass growth in lowlands, disturbed areas and riparian biomes on calcareous soils. It has also become [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] in eastern [[China]]<ref name=\"gelderen\" />  and can be found in some of the cooler areas of the [[Australian continent]] where it is listed as a pest [[invasive species]].\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Acer negundo tree.jpg|thumb|Boxelder, Manitoba Maple. Tree. ND, USA.]]\n\nThis species prefers bright sunlight. It often grows on flood plains and other disturbed areas with ample water supply, such as [[riparian]] habitats. Human influence has greatly favoured this species; it grows around houses and in hedges, as well as on disturbed ground and vacant lots.\n\nSeveral [[bird]]s and some [[squirrel]]s feed on the seeds.  The [[evening grosbeak]] uses them extensively. The [[Maple Bug]] (also known as the Boxelder Bug) lays its [[egg]]s on all maples, but prefers this species.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nAlthough its weak wood, irregular form, and prolific seeding might make it seem like a poor choice for a landscape tree, ''A. negundo'' is one of the most common maples in cultivation and many interesting [[cultivar]]s have been developed, including:<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* 'Auratum'&nbsp;\u2013 yellowish leaves with smooth undersides\n* 'Aureomarginatum'&nbsp;\u2013 creamy yellow leaf margins\n* 'Baron'&nbsp;\u2013 Hardier & seedless variety\n* 'Elegans'&nbsp;\u2013 distinctively convex leaves\n* 'Flamingo'&nbsp;\u2013 pink and white [[variegation]] (very popular)\n* [[Acer negundo 'Pendulum'|'Pendulum']]&nbsp;\u2013 with weeping branches.\n* 'Variegatum'&nbsp;\u2013 creamy white leaf margins\n* 'Violaceum'&nbsp;\u2013 younger shoots and branches have bluish colour\n\n== Uses ==\nAlthough its light, close-grained, soft wood is considered undesirable for most uses, this tree has been considered as a commercial source of wood fiber, for use in [[fiberboard]].\n\nThere is some commercial use of the tree for various decorative applications, such as turned items (bowls, stem-ware, pens). Primarily burl wood and injured wood, where the primary reason is this wood's reaction to injury, where the injured wood develops a red stain.\n\n=== Use by Native Americans ===\nThe [[Navajo people|Navajo]] use the wood to make tubes for bellows.<ref>Elmore, Francis H. 1944 Ethnobotany of the Navajo.

Many of its features, especially its leaves, are quite variable in form. At maturity it often attains a height of around {{convert|15|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}. Its flowers, petioles, twigs and seeds are all red to varying degrees. Among these features, however, it is best known for its brilliant deep scarlet foliage in autumn.\n\nOver most of its range, red maple is adaptable to a very wide range of site conditions, perhaps more so than any other tree in eastern North America. It can be found growing in [[swamp]]s, on poor dry [[soil]]s, and most anywhere in between. It grows well from [[sea level]] to about {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Due to its attractive fall foliage and pleasing form, it is often used as a shade tree for landscapes. It is used commercially on a small scale for [[maple syrup]] production as well as for its medium to high quality lumber. It is also the [[List of U.S. state trees|State Tree of Rhode Island]]. The red maple can be considered weedy or invasive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plants Profile for Acer rubrum|url=http://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=ACRU|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref> It is taking over forests in the eastern US, replacing traditional mainstays like oaks, as well as hickories and pines.<ref>{{cite web | title=Eastern Forests Change Color As Red Maples Proliferate | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/27/science/eastern-forests-change-color-as-red-maples-proliferate.html | publisher=New York Times | access-date=30 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Redmaplefoliage.jpg|thumb|Typical fall foliage in red maple country.]]\nThough ''A. rubrum'' is usually easy to identify, it is highly changeable in morphological characteristics.

As with nearly all North American maple trees, they are [[deciduous]] and arranged oppositely on the twig. They are typically {{convert|5|\u2013|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long and wide with 3-5 [[palmate lobe]]s with a serrated margin. The [[sinus (botany)|sinuses]] are typically narrow, but the leaves can exhibit considerable variation.<ref name=\"VT\" /> When 5 lobes are present, the three at the terminal end are larger than the other two near the base. In contrast, the leaves of the related [[silver maple]], ''A. saccharinum'', are much more deeply lobed, more sharply toothed and characteristically have 5 lobes. The upper side of ''A. rubrum'''s leaf is light green and the underside is whitish and can be either [[glaucous]] or hairy. The leaf stalks are usually red and are up to {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long. Furthermore, the leaves can turn a brilliant red in autumn, but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals.\n\n[[File:2013-05-10 13 40 17 Immature foliage of Red Maple in Brendan T Byrne State Forest, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Immature foliage of Acer rubrum (Red Maple)]]\nThe [[twig]]s of the red maple are reddish in color and somewhat shiny with small [[lenticel]]s. Dwarf shoots are present on many branches. The [[bud]]s are usually blunt and greenish to reddish in color, generally with several loose scales. The lateral buds are slightly stalked, and in addition there may be collateral buds present as well. The buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their reddish tint. The leaf scars on the twig are V-shaped and contain 3 bundle scars.<ref name=\"VT\" />\n\n[[File:Acer rubrum drummondii drawing.png|right|thumb|Drawing showing male and female flower, leaf and samara]]\nThe [[flower]]s are generally unisexual, with male and female flowers appearing in separate [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]] clusters, though they are sometimes also bisexual.

After they reach maturity, the seeds are dispersed for a 1 to 2 week period from April through July.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n''A. rubrum'' is one of the most abundant and widespread trees in eastern [[North America]]. It can be found from the south of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Nova Scotia]] and southern [[Quebec]] to the south west of Ontario, extreme southeastern [[Manitoba]] and northern [[Minnesota]]; south to [[Wisconsin]], [[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], eastern [[Oklahoma]], and eastern [[Texas]] in its western range; and east to [[Florida]]. It has the largest continuous range along the North American [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] of any tree that occurs in Florida. In total it ranges {{convert|2600|km|mi|abbr=on}} from north to south.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> The species is native to all regions of the United States east of the [[95th meridian west|95th meridian]]. The tree's range ends where the {{convert|-40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} mean minimum [[isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]] begins, namely in southeastern [[Canada]]. ''A. rubrum'' is not present in the Prairie Peninsula of the northern [[Midwest]], the [[Western Gulf coastal grasslands|coastal prairie]] in southern [[Louisiana]] and southeastern Texas and the swamp prairie of the [[Florida Everglades]].<ref name=\"USDF\" /> The absence of red maple in the Prairie Peninsula is perhaps due to the specie's intolerance of fire.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/Volume_2/acer/rubrum.htm|title=Acer rubrum L.|last=Walters|first=Russell S|last2=Yawney|first2=Harry W.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn several other locations, the tree is absent from large areas but still present in a few specific habitats. An example is the [[Bluegrass region]] of Kentucky, where red maple is not found in the dominant open plains, but is present along streams.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Campbell| first=J| title=The Land of Cane and Clover| page=25| publisher=University of Kentucky| year=1985| postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the [[Grain Belt]], despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Linnaeus Acer rubrum.jpg|thumb|right|The type specimen of ''A. rubrum'' used by [[Carl Linnaeus]] when naming the species]] -->''A. rubrum'' does very well in a wide range of soil types, with varying textures, moisture, [[pH]], and elevation, probably more so than any other forest tree in North America.

[[Chlorosis]] can occur on very [[alkaline]] soils, though otherwise its pH tolerance is quite high. Moist mineral soil is best for germination of seeds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe red maple can grow in a variety of moist and dry biomes, from dry ridges and sunny, southwest-facing slopes to [[peat bog]]s and [[swamp]]s. While many types of tree prefer a south or north facing aspect, the red maple does not appear to have a preference.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> Its ideal conditions are in moderately well-drained, moist sites at low or intermediate elevations. However, it is nonetheless common in mountainous areas on relatively dry ridges, as well as on both the south and west sides of upper slopes. Furthermore, it is common in swampy areas, along the banks of slow moving streams, as well as on poorly drained flats and depressions. In northern [[Michigan]] and [[New England]], the tree is found on the tops of ridges, sandy or rocky upland and otherwise dry soils, as well as in nearly pure stands on moist soils and the edges of swamps. In the far south of its range, it is almost exclusively associated with swamps.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> Additionally, Red maple is one of the most drought-tolerant species of maple in the Carolinas.<ref name=\"Miller\">Miller, J.H., & Miller, K.V. (1999). ''Forest plants of the southeast and their wildlife uses''. Champaign, IL: Kings Time Printing.</ref>\n\nRed maple is far more abundant today than when Europeans first arrived in North America, where along with its cousin Silver Maple, it may have comprised a mere 5% of forest area and was confined mostly to [[riparian zone]]s.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> The density of the tree in many of these areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing, much of it due to human factors, especially suppression of wildfires which would kill shallow-rooted pioneer species like red maple, but leave mainline forest trees like oaks and hickories untouched.\n\nAdditionally, conservation efforts of the red maple have caused a major increase in the population of [[white-tailed deer]] since the mid-20th century. Deer will readily consume acorns, but leave maple seeds untouched, thus reducing the ability of oaks to regenerate compared to maples.<ref name=\"Perdue\" />  Because it can grow on a variety of substrates, has a high pH tolerance, and grows in both shade and sun, ''A. rubrum'' can be called a \"super-generalist,\" and it is predicted to replace historically dominant tree species in the eastern United States such as  [[oak]]s, [[hickory]]s and [[pine]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abrams|first=M.D.|year=1998|title=The Red Maple Paradox: what explains the widespread expansion of red maple in eastern forests?|url=|journal=BioScience|volume=48 |issue=5|pages=355\u2013364|via=}}</ref> Extensive use of red maple in landscaping has also contributed to the surge in the species' numbers as volunteer seedlings proliferate.

Its ability to thrive in a large number of habitats is largely due to its ability to produce [[root]]s to suit its site from a young age. In wet locations, red maple seedlings produce short [[taproot]]s with long and developed lateral roots, while on dry sites, they develop long taproots with significantly shorter laterals. The roots are primarily horizontal, however, forming in the upper {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} of the ground. Mature trees have woody roots up to {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. They are very tolerant of flooding, with one study showing that 60 days of flooding caused no leaf damage. At the same time, they are tolerant of drought due to their ability to stop growing under dry conditions by then producing a second growth flush when conditions later improve, even if growth has stopped for 2 weeks.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\n[[File:Maplekeys.jpg|left|thumb|Samaras from a specimen in [[Milford, New Hampshire]]]]\n''A. rubrum'' is one of the first plants to flower in spring. A crop of seeds is generally produced every year with a bumper crop often occurring every second year. A single tree between {{convert|5|and|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter can produce between 12,000 and 91,000 seeds in a season. A tree {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter was shown to produce nearly a million seeds.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> Red maple produces one of the smallest seeds of any of the maples.<ref name=\"Miller\" />  Fertilization has also been shown to significantly increase the seed yield for up to two years after application. The seeds are [[epigeal germination|epigeal]] and tend to germinate in early summer soon after they are released, assuming a small amount of light, moisture, and sufficient temperatures are present. If the seeds are densely shaded, then germination commonly does not occur until the next spring. Most seedlings do not survive in closed [[canopy (biology)|forest canopy]] situations. However, one- to four-year-old seedlings are common under dense canopy and though they eventually die if no light reaches them, they serve as a reservoir, waiting to fill any open area of the canopy above. Trees growing in a Zone 9 or 10 area such as Florida will usually die from cold damage if transferred up north, Canada, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, even if the southern trees were planted with northern red maples. Due to their wide range, genetically the trees have adapted to the climatic differences.\n\n[[File:2015-04-13 10 38 10 Female Red Maple flowers on Madison Avenue in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Female flowers]]\nRed maple is able to increase its numbers significantly when associate trees are damaged by disease, cutting, or fire. One study found that 6 years after [[clearcutting]] a {{convert|3.4|ha|acre|abbr=off}} Oak-Hickory forest containing no red maples, the plot contained more than 2,200 red maple seedlings per hectare (900 per acre) taller than {{convert|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> One of its associates, the [[black cherry]] (''[[Prunus serotina]]''), contains benzoic acid, which has been shown to be a potential [[allelopathic]] inhibitor of red maple growth. Red maple is one of the first species to start stem elongation. In one study, stem elongation was one-half completed in 1 week, after which growth slowed and was 90% completed within only 54 days. In good light and moisture conditions, the seedlings can grow {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in their first year and up to {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} each year for the next few years making it a fast grower.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\nThe red maple is a used as a food source by several forms of wildlife. [[Elk]] and [[white-tailed deer]] in particular use the current season's growth of red maple as an important source of winter food. Several [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies and moths) utilize the leaves as food; see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on maples]].\n\n[[File:2015-04-12 16 31 55 Male Red Maple flowers on Bayberry Road in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|left|thumb|Male flowers]]\nDue to ''A. rubrum'''s very wide range, there is significant variation in hardiness, size, form, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, have the most reddish fall color, set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. In Florida, at the extreme south of the red maple's range, it is limited exclusively to swamplands. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief, frost-free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As a result of the variation there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation. This is especially useful for making urban [[cultivar]]s that require resistance from [[verticillium wilt]], air pollution, and drought.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\n[[File:Autumn Blaze Maple in Toronto.jpg|right|thumb|160px|''Acer \u00d7 freemanii'' 'Jeffersred' in Toronto]]\nRed maple frequently hybridizes with [[Silver Maple]]; the [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]], known as Freeman's Maple ''Acer x freemanii'', is intermediate between the parents.\n\n=== Allergenic potential ===\nThe allergenic potential of red maples varies widely based on the cultivar.\n\nThe following cultivars are completely [[male]] and are highly allergenic, with an [[OPALS (Ogren Plant Allergy Scale)|OPALS]] allergy scale rating of 8 or higher:<ref name=Ogren>{{cite book|last1=Ogren|first1=Thomas|title=The Allergy-Fighting Garden|date=2015|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=978-1-60774-491-7|pages=54\u201355}}</ref>\n\n* 'Autumn Flame' ('Flame')\n* 'Autumn Spire'\n* 'Columnare' ('Pyramidale')\n* 'Firedance' ('Landsburg')\n* 'Karpick'\n* 'Northwood'\n* 'October Brilliance'\n* 'Sun Valley'\n* 'Tiliford'\n\nThe following cultivars have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 3 or lower; they are completely [[female]] trees, and have low potential for causing allergies:<ref name=\"Ogren\" />\n\n* 'Autumn Glory'\n* 'Bowhall'\n* 'Davey Red'\n* 'Doric'\n* 'Embers'\n* 'Festival'\n* 'October Glory'\n* 'Red Skin'\n* 'Red Sunset' ('Franksred')\n\n=== Toxicity ===\nThe leaves of red maple, especially when dead or wilted, are extremely [[List of plants poisonous to equines|toxic to horses]].

The ingestion of 700&nbsp;grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, [[jaundice]], dark brown urine, [[horse colic|colic]], [[laminitis]], coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of [[methylene blue]] or mineral oil and [[activated carbon]] in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as [[blood transfusion]]s, fluid support, [[diuretic]]s, and anti-oxidants such as [[Vitamin C]].

The wood is close grained and as such it is similar to that of ''A. saccharum'', but its texture is softer, less dense, and has a poorer figure and machining qualities. High grades of wood from the red maple can nonetheless be substituted for hard maple, particularly when it comes to making [[furniture]]. As a soft maple, the wood tends to shrink more during the drying process than with the hard maples.\n\nRed maple is also used for the production of [[maple syrup]], though the hard maples ''[[Acer saccharum]]'' (sugar maple) and ''[[Acer nigrum]]'' (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple, as well as those of the ''[[Acer saccharinum]]'' (silver maple), ''[[Acer negundo]]'' (boxelder), and ''[[Acer platanoides]]'' (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\nRed maple is a medium quality firewood,<ref>{{cite web|title=Heating With Wood: Species Characteristics and Volumes|author=Michael Kuhns and Tom Schmidt|date=n.d.|publisher=UtahState University Cooperative Extension|url=http://extension.usu.edu/forestry/HomeTown/General_HeatingWithWood.htm}}</ref> possessing less heat energy, nominally 5.4 MJ/m\u00b3 (18.7 million BTU (mbtu) per cord), than other hardwoods such as Ash: 7 MJ/m\u00b3 (24 mbtu/cord), Oak: 7 MJ/m\u00b3 (24 mbtu/cord), or Birch: 5.8 MJ/m\u00b3 (20 mbtu/cord).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of plants poisonous to equines]]\n* [[List of foods made from maple]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikispecies}}\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ACRU NRCS: United States Department of Agriculture Plants Profile and map: ''Acer rubrum'']\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/acru.htm ''Acer rubrum'' images from Vanderbilt University]\n*[http://www.portraitoftheearth.com/trees/redsilvermaple.html Portrait of the Earth, Winter ID photos]\n{{Commons category|position=left|Acer rubrum}}\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Acer|rubrum]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Flora of Southeastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Symbols of Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Plants used in bonsai]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

It is one of the most common trees in the [[United States]].\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Silver maple leaf.jpg|thumb|left|A silver maple leaf]]\nThe silver maple tree is a relatively fast-growing [[deciduous]] [[tree]], commonly reaching a height of {{convert|15|\u2013|25|m|ft|abbr=on}}, exceptionally {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Its spread will generally be {{convert|11|\u2013|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide. A 10-year-old sapling will stand about {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. It is often found along waterways and in wetlands, leading to the colloquial name \"water maple\". It is a highly adaptable tree, although it has higher sunlight requirements than other maple trees.\n\n[[Image:Silver Maple Acer saccharinum Leaves 2598px.jpg|thumb|left|Silver maple leaves]]\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are [[leaf shape|simple]] and palmately veined, 8\u201316&nbsp;cm long and 6\u201312&nbsp;cm broad, with deep angular notches between the five lobes. The 5\u201312&nbsp;cm long, slender stalks of the leaves mean that even a light breeze can produce a striking effect as the downy silver undersides of the leaves are exposed. The autumn color is less pronounced than in many maples, generally ending up a pale yellow, although some specimens can produce a more brilliant yellow and even orange and red colorations. The tree has a tendency to color and drop its leaves slightly earlier in autumn than other maples.\n\n[[Image:Soft Maple Helicopter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Samara (fruit)|Samaras]] and leaves forming in April.]]\nThe [[flower]]s are in dense clusters, produced before the leaves in early spring,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_IJM.pl?key=10696|title=Jepson Flora Project}}</ref> with the [[seed]]s maturing in early summer. The fruit are [[Samara (fruit)|samaras]], each containing a single seed, and winged, in pairs, small (5\u201310&nbsp;mm diameter), the wing about 3\u20135&nbsp;cm long. The fruit are the largest of any native maple. Although the wings provide for some transport by air, the fruit are heavy and are also transported by water. Silver Maple and its close cousin [[Red Maple]] are the only ''Acer'' species which produce their fruit crop in spring instead of fall. The seeds of both trees have no epigeal dormancy and will germinate immediately.\n\nOn mature trunks, the bark is gray and shaggy. On branches and young trunks, the bark is smooth and silvery gray.\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[File:2014-11-02 15 41 21 Silver Maple foliage during autumn along Glen Mawr Drive in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|thumb|right|Typical yellow autumn leaf color]]\n[[File:2014-11-02 15 14 57 Silver Maple foliage during autumn along Pingree Avenue in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|right|thumb|Atypical reddish autumn color; this sort of coloration is sporadic and uncommon]]\nWildlife uses the silver maple in various ways. In many parts of the eastern U.S., the large rounded buds are one of the primary food sources for [[squirrels]] during the spring, after many acorns and nuts have sprouted and the squirrels' food is scarce. The seeds are also a food source for squirrels, [[chipmunk]]s and birds. The bark can be eaten by [[beaver]] and [[deer]]. The trunks tend to produce cavities, which can shelter squirrels, [[raccoon]]s, [[opossum]]s, [[owl]]s and [[woodpecker]]s.<ref name=USDA_Plant_Guide>{{cite web|last=Geyer|first=W.

It is highly tolerant of urban situations, and is frequently planted next to streets. However, its quick growth produces brittle wood, and is commonly damaged in storms. The silver maple's root system is shallow and fibrous, and easily invades septic fields and old drain pipes; it can also crack sidewalks and foundations. It is a vigorous resprouter, and if not pruned, will often grow with multiple trunks. Although it naturally is found near water, it can grow on drier ground if planted there. In ideal natural conditions, ''A. saccharinum'' may live up 130 years, but in urban environments often 80 or less.\n\nFollowing WWII, silver maples were commonly used as a landscaping and street tree in suburban housing developments and cities due to their rapid growth, especially as a replacement for the blighted [[American Elm]]. However, they fell out of favor for this purpose because of brittle wood, unattractive form when not pruned or trained, and tendency to produce large numbers of volunteer seedlings, and nowadays it is much less popular for this purpose to the point where some towns and cities banned its use as a street tree.\n\nIt is also commonly cultivated outside its native range, showing tolerance of a wide range of climates, growing successfully as far north as central [[Norway]] and south to [[Orlando, Florida]]. It can thrive in a [[Mediterranean climate]], as at [[Jerusalem]] and [[Los Angeles]], if summer water is provided. It is also grown in temperate parts of the [[Southern Hemisphere]]: [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]], the [[Brazil|southern states of Brazil]] (as well as in a few low-temperature locations within the states of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Minas Gerais]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe silver maple is closely related to the [[red maple]] (''[[Acer rubrum]]''), and can hybridise with it. The [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] variation is known as the Freeman maple (''Acer'' x ''freemanii''). The Freeman maple is a popular ornamental tree in [[park]]s and large [[garden]]s, combining the fast growth of silver maple with the less brittle wood, less invasive roots, and the beautiful bright red fall foliage of the red maple.\n\nThe silver maple is the favoured [[Host (biology)|host]] of the [[Parasitism|parasitic]] [[Pulvinaria innumerabilis|cottony maple scale]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} and the maple bladder gall mite ''[[Vasates quadripedes]]''.<ref name=\"Redfern\">{{cite book|author1=Redfern M. |author2=Shirley P.R. |author3=Bloxham M. |title=British Plant Galls (Second Edition)|year=2011|publisher=Field Studies Council|location=Preston Montford|isbn=978 1 85153 284 1|page=23}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nIn the English Christmas carol, \"Wassail, Wassail All Over the Town\", the \"white maple\" in  [[Wassailing#Wassail bowls|\"Our bowl, it is made of the white maple tree\"]] refers not to the silver (white) maple, but the wood of the sycamore maple, ''[[Acer pseudoplatanus]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ACSA2 United States Department of Agriculture Plants Profile: ''Acer saccharinum'']\n*[http://www.hort.uconn.edu/plants/a/acesac/acesac1.html University of Connecticut Plant Database: Silver Maple]\n*[http://wildwnc.org/trees/Acer_saccharinum.html Trees of Western North Carolina: Silver Maple]\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/acsa2.htm ''Acer saccharinum'' images from Vanderbilt University]\n*[http://www.google.com/tree/Silver_maple.html Trees of Western North Carolina: Silver]\n* [http://www.portraitoftheearth.com/trees/redsilvermaple.html Portrait of the Earth, Winter ID pictures]\n*[http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/acer-saccharinum-silver-maple-native-range-map.php Plant Maps, Interactive Distribution Map for ''Acer saccharinum'']\n*[http://www.tropicos.org/Image/88052 photo of herbarium specimen at Missouri Botanical Garden, collected in Missouri in 1989]\n{{Commons category|Acer saccharinum}}\n\n[[Category:Acer|saccharinum]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Flora of Southeastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Plants used in Native American cuisine]]\n[[Category:Plants used in traditional Native American medicine]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

It is native to eastern North America and can be found from western [[Nova Scotia]] and southern [[New Brunswick]] south to [[Florida]] and [[Texas]].\n\n==Description==\n\n[[File:Alnus serrulata leaves.jpg|left|thumb| Alnus serrulata leaves (detailed)]]\n[[File:Alnus serrulata seed cones.jpg|left|thumb| Alnus serrulata seed cones (detailed)]]\n\n''Alnus serrulata'' is a large shrub or small tree that may grow up to {{convert|2.5|\u2013|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. The scientific name originates from alnus which is an old name for alder; serrulata points to the finely-toothed leaf margins which it possesses. It takes about 10 yrs to mature. The plant prefers moist soil near streams, pond margins, and riversides. It usually has multiple stems from its base and reddish-green flowers. The broad, flat, dark green leaves are about 2 to 4 inches long.\n\n'''Leaf''': The simple, round leaves are obovate, 2 to 5 in long, 1.2 to 2.8 in wide, obtuse, wider at middle, and V-shaped base. Veins are pinnate and conspicuous. Leaves have a smooth texture above and hairy texture below. The upper side of the leaves are dark green and the undersides are pale green.\n\n'''Flower''': The flowers are monoecious, meaning that both sexes are found on a single plant. Male (Staminate) catkins are 1.6-2.4 in long; female (Pistillate) catkins are 1/2 in long. Reddish-green flowers open in March to April.\n\n'''Fruit''': The ovate, dark brown, cone-like fruit is hard with winged scales. Seeds are produced in small cones and do not have wings. Fruit usually matures during fall and is quite persistent.\n\n'''Twig''': The twigs are reddish-brown and have a 3-angled-pith; young twigs are covered with hairs.\n\n'''Bark''': The bark is brownish gray, smooth, and has a bitter and astringent taste.\n\n\u3000\n\u3000\n\n==Distribution==\n\n''Alnus serrulata'' is mainly located in eastern North America. It ranges from [[Maine]] to Northern [[Florida]], west to southeastern [[Oklahoma]], [[Missouri]], and [[Illinois]]. It also grows along the [[Mississippi river]]. It is not present in northern [[New Hampshire]] and [[Vermont]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\nThe scientific name of Smooth Alder is ''Alnus serrulata'' (Aiton) Willd., synonymous with ''Alnus noveboracensis'' Britton, ''Alnus rubra'' Desfontaines ex Spach, ''Alnus rugosa'' (Du Roi) Sprengel, ''Alnus rugosa'' (Du Roi) Sprengel var. ''serrulata'' (W. Aiton) H. Winkler, ''Alnus serrulata'' (W. Aiton) Willdenow var. ''subelliptica'' Fernald, and ''Betula serrulata'' W. Aiton. \nIt has English common names including common alder, tag alder, hazel alder, and smooth alder.\n\n==Cultivation==\n\n''Alnus serrulata'' can be found in a habitats such as stream streambanks, riversides, and swamps. Water use is high and it requires sun or part-sun. It also requires moist soil that has a PH of 6.8-7.2. ''Alnus serrulata'' needs 5\u201310-foot spacing in wildlife habitat.\n\n==Uses==\n\nBecause the plant resides in riversides or stream streambanks, it usually functions as a stabilizer and restorer for those habitats. It is also used to treat [[astringent]], [[diuretic]], [[emetic]], [[Human eye|ophthalmic]], and [[purgative]] symptoms. A tea made from the bark is said to work as a treatment for diarrhea, coughs, toothaches, sore mouth, and the pain of birth.\n\n==References==\n\n1.\tSeiler, John R., Jensen, Edward C., and Peterson, John A.. \"Alnus Serrulata Fact Sheet.\" VT Forest Biology and Dendrology.

In younger trees the bark is characteristic of most [[birch]]es, with smooth bark and distinct horizontal [[lenticel]]s. It is sometimes mistakenly identified as a [[Prunus|cherry]] tree. In some older tree specimens the [[bark]] can (unlike most birches) develop vertical cracks into irregular scaly plates revealing rough darkish brown bark patterns. This, however, does not occur in all specimens.  The twigs, when scraped, have a strong scent of wintergreen due to [[methyl salicylate]], which is produced in the bark. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, ovate, {{convert|5|to(-)|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4|to(-)|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} broad, with a finely serrated margin. The [[flower]]s are [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]] [[catkin]]s {{convert|3|to(-)|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the male catkins pendulous, the female catkins erect. The [[fruit]], maturing in fall, is composed of numerous tiny winged [[seed]]s packed between the catkin bracts. Seed production mainly occurs in trees that are between 40 and 70 years old, although light crops may occur as early as 20 years. The average lifespan of ''B. lenta'' is 100 years, with a maximum of 150.\n\n''Betula lenta'' was used commercially in the past for production of oil of wintergreen before modern industrial synthesis of the oil; the tree's name reflects the wintergreen scent of the shoots.\n\nThe [[Plant sap|sap]] flows about a month later than [[maple]] sap, and much faster. The trees can be tapped in a similar fashion, but must be gathered about three times more often. [[Birch sap]] can be boiled the same as maple sap, but its syrup is stronger (like [[molasses]]).\n\nThe leaves of this species serve as food for some [[caterpillar]]s (see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on birches]]) and the solitary leaf-cutter bee ''[[Megachile rubi]]'' cuts pieces from the leaves to line the cells of its nest.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Eickwort, George C. |author2=Matthews, Robert W. |author3=Carpenter, James |year=1981 |title=Observations on the Nesting Behavior of ''Megachile rubi'' and ''M. texana'' with a Discussion of the Significance of Soil Nesting in the Evolution of Megachilid Bees (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) |journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society  |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=557\u2013570 |jstor=25084194 }}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nImage:BetulaLentaBark.jpg|Closeup of bark\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{Commonscat-inline|Betula lenta}}\n*[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233500250 Flora of North America: ''Betula lenta''] [http://www.efloras.org/object_page.aspx?object_id=5742&flora_id=1 RangeMap:]\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/bele.htm ''Betula lenta'' images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu]\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n[[Category:Betula|lenta]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Trees of Quebec]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Medicinal plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Trees of humid continental climate]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]",

''B. resinifera'') or '''Alaska Birch''', also known as '''Alaska Paper Birch''' or '''Resin Birch''', is a species of [[birch]] native to [[Alaska]] and northern [[Canada]]. Its range covers most of interior Alaska, and extends from the southern [[Brooks Range]] to the [[Chugach Range]] in Alaska, including the [[Turnagain Arm]] and northern half of the [[Kenai Peninsula]], easterward from [[Norton Sound]] into western [[Ontario]], and north to [[Northwest Territories]] and southern [[Nunavut]].\n\nThis tree typically grows to {{convert|15|-|20|m|abbr=on}} tall, occasionally up to {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}}, and achieves a trunk diameter of {{convert|30|-|50|cm|abbr=on}}, and sometimes to more than {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}}. It grows in a variety of habitats, from wetlands to ridgetops at altitudes of {{convert|100|-|1200|m|abbr=on}}. The mature [[bark]] ranges widely in color, from pure white to red, yellowish, pinkish, or gray. Bark of twigs, seedlings, and saplings is dark, from reddish to almost black, and covered with resin glands. The [[leaf|leaves]] are triangular-ovate, {{convert|3|-|8|cm|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|-|6|cm|abbr=on}} broad, with a truncate base and an acuminate apex, and a double-serrated margin. The [[fruit]]ing [[catkin]]s are {{convert|2|-|4|cm|abbr=on}} long and about  {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on}} broad. It is able to tolerate extreme cold, as low as {{convert|-55|F|C|order=flip}}.\n\nAlthough it is [[diploid]] like its close relatives, the [[Eurasia]]n [[Silver Birch]] and the eastern American [[Gray Birch]], it frequently [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridizes]] with the [[polyploid|hexaploid]] [[Paper Birch]]; the hybrid is known as ''Betula \u00d7 winteri''.

The most southerly stand in the Western United States is located in Long Canyon in the [[Boulder, Colorado|City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks]]. This is an isolated Pleistocene [[relict]] that most likely reflects the southern reach of boreal vegetation into the area during the last Ice Age.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/files/openspace/pdf_gis/IndependentResearchReports/249_Cooper_David_Ecological.pdf|title = Ecological Survey of the City of Boulder, Colorado Mountain Parks|last = Cooper|first = David J.|publisher = City of [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] Parks and Recreation Department|format = PDF|page = 16|date = Spring 1984|accessdate = 2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nIn Alaska, paper birch often naturally grows in pure stands with itself or with [[black spruce|black]] or [[white spruce]]. In the eastern and central regions of its range it is often associated with [[red spruce]] and [[balsam fir]].<ref name=\"fed\" /> It may also be associated with [[Big-Toothed Aspen|big-toothed aspen]], [[yellow birch]], ''[[Betula populifolia]]'', and [[Acer (plant)|maples]]\n\nShrubs often associated with paper birch in the eastern part of its range include: beaked hazel (''[[Corylus cornuta]]''), common bearberry (''[[Arctostaphylos uva-ursi]]''), dwarf bush-honeysuckle (''[[Diervilla lonicera]]''), wintergreen (''[[Gaultheria procumbens]]''), wild sarsaparilla (''[[Aralia nudicaulis]]''), blueberries (''[[Vaccinium]] spp.''), raspberries and blackberries (''[[Rubus]] spp.''), elderberry (''[[Sambucus]] spp.''), and hobblebush (''[[Viburnum alnifolium]]'').\n\n=== Successional relationships ===\n[[File:Boreal forestfire.jpg|thumb|left|A prescribed fire in a black spruce-paper birch-quaking aspen community in boreal Alaska.]]\n\n''Betula papyrifera'' is a [[pioneer species]] meaning it is often one of the first trees to grow in an area after other trees are removed by some sort of disturbance. Typical disturbances colonized by paper birch are [[wildfire]], [[avalanche]], or [[windthrow]] areas where the wind has blown down all trees. When it grows in these pioneer, or early [[secondary succession|successional]], woodlands it often forms stands of trees where it is the only species.<ref name=\"fs\">{{cite web|title=Betula papyrifera|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/betpap/all.html|website=www.fs.fed.us|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nPaper birch is considered well adapted to fires it recovers quickly by means of reseeding the area or regrowth from the burned tree. The lightweight seeds are easily carried by the wind to burned areas where they quickly germinate and grow into new trees. Paper birch is adapted to ecosystems where fires occur every 50\u2013150 years<ref name=\"fs\" /> For example, it is frequently an early invader after fire in [[black spruce]] [[boreal forest]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 |title=Black Spruce (Picea mariana) |first=C.

Since these stands are fire resistant they may become seed trees to reseed the area around them which was burned. However, in dry periods paper birch is flammable and will burn rapidly.<ref name=\"fs\" /> As the bark is flammable it will often burn and may [[Girdling|girdle]] the tree.\n\n=== Wildlife ===\nBirch bark is a winter staple food for [[moose]]. The nutritional quality is poor due to the large quantities of [[lignin]], which make digestion difficult, but is important to wintering moose because of its sheer abundance.<ref name=\"fs\" /> Moose prefer paper birch over [[aspen]], [[alder]], and [[balsam poplar]] but they prefer willow (''[[salix|Salix spp.]]'') over birch and the other species listed. Although moose consume large amounts of paper birch in the winter, if they were to only eat paper birch they may die.<ref name=\"fs\" />\n\nAlthough [[white-tailed deer]] consider birch a \"secondary-choice food\", it is an important dietary component. In Minnesota, white-tailed deer eat considerable amounts of paper birch leaves in the fall. [[Snowshoe hare]]s browse paper birch seedlings.<ref name=\"fs\" /> [[North American porcupine|Porcupines]] feed on the inner bark of the tree and beavers will also feed on the tree. The seeds of paper birch are an important part of the diet of many birds and small mammals including [[chickadee]]s, [[redpoll]]s, [[vole]]s, and [[ruffed grouse]]. [[Yellow bellied sapsucker]]s drill holes in the bark of paper birch to get at the sap, this is one of their favorite trees for feeding on.<ref name=\"fs\" />\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:White birch at Acadia National Park, ME IMG 2177.JPG|200px|thumb|right|White birch at [[Acadia National Park]] in [[Maine]]]]\n\n''Betula papyrifera'' has a soft,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} yet moderately heavy, white wood.

The raw sap contains 0.9% carbohydrates ([[glucose]], [[fructose]], [[sucrose]])<ref name=\"fed\" /> as compared to 2-3% within [[sugar maple]] sap. The sap flows later in the season than maples.  Currently, only a few small scale operations in Alaska and [[Yukon]] currently produce birch syrup from this species.<ref name=\"fed\" />\n\n=== Bark ===\n[[File:Ecorce de bouleau.JPG|thumb|left|Peeling bark]]\nIts bark is an excellent fire starter; it ignites at high temperatures even when wet. The bark has an energy density of 5740 cal/g and 3209 cal/cm{{sup|3}}, the highest per unit weight of 24 species tested.<ref name=\"fed\" />\n\nPanels of bark can be fitted or sewn together to make cartons and boxes (a birchbark box is called a ''[[wiigwaasi-makak]]'' in the Anishinaabe language). The bark is also used to create a durable waterproof layer in the construction of sod-roofed houses.<ref name=\"Ewing, Susan 1996\" /> Many indigenous groups (i.e. Wabanaki peoples) use birch-bark for making various items such as canoes, containers and wigwams.\n\n=== Plantings ===\nPaper birch is planted to reclaim old mines and other disturbed sites, often bare-root or small saplings are planted when this is the goal.<ref name=\"fs\" /> Since paper birch is an adaptable pioneer species it is a prime candidate for reforesting drastically disturbed areas.\n\nWhen used in landscape planting, it should not be planted near [[black walnut]] as the chemical [[juglone]], exuded from the roots of black walnut, is very toxic to paper birch.\n\nIt is frequently planted as an ornamental due to its graceful form and attractive bark.

It prefers poor, dry upland soils, but is also found in moist mixed woodlands. Living only about 30 years, it is a common [[pioneer species]] on abandoned fields and burned areas.\n\n==Characteristics==\nGray birch grows quickly to 20 to 30 feet tall and 15 inch trunk diameter, with an irregular open crown of slender branches.  The tree often has multiple trunks branching off of an old stump.  The [[leaf|leaves]] are 5-7.5&nbsp;cm long by 4\u20136&nbsp;cm wide, alternately arranged, ovate, and tapering to an elongated tip.  They are dark green and glabrous above and paler below, with a coarsely serrated margin.<ref name=\"refname1\"/> The [[bark]] is chalky to grayish white with black triangular patches where branch meets trunk. It is most easily confused for the [[paper birch]] (''Betula papyrifera'') by means of its bark; it is smooth and thin but does not readily exfoliate like paper birch does. The [[flower]]s are wind-pollinated [[catkin]]s 5\u20138&nbsp;cm long, the male catkins pendulous and the female catkins erect.  The [[fruit]], maturing in autumn, is composed of many tiny winged seeds packed between the catkin bracts.\n\nThe [[wood]] is medium hard and is used for high grade plywood, furniture, drum shells, spools and firewood.\n\nLike other North American birches, gray birch is highly resistant to the [[Bronze birch borer]] (''Agrilus anxius'').<ref name=\"refname2\"/> The leaves of the gray birch serve as food for various [[Lepidoptera]], such as the [[leaf miner]] moth ''[[Cameraria betulivora]]''. Between about 1930 and 1950, many gray birch trees, along with paper birch and [[Betula alleghaniensis|yellow birch]] (''Betula alleghaniensis''), were affected and killed by  [[Birch dieback|birch dieback disease]].<ref name=Ciesla>{{cite book|author1=Ciesla, William M. |author2=Donaubauer, Edwin|title=Decline and Dieback of Trees and Forests: A Global Overview |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDgYfi1G8L0C&pg=PA18 |year=1994 |publisher=Food & Agriculture Org. |isbn=978-92-5-103502-3 |pages=18, 698}}</ref>\n\nGray birch has been commonly planted as a landscaping tree in southern Pennsylvania and New Jersey as it tolerates heat and humidity better than [[paper birch]] and is more resistant to [[bronze birch borer]]s and [[leaf miner]]s.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=230px heights=230px perrow=3>\nImage:betula_populifolia_leaves.jpg|''Betula populifolia'' leaves, New Brunswick, Canada\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"refname1\">Hardin, James W., Donald Joseph Leopold, and Fred M.

[[Nymph (biology)|Nymphs]] of the [[pineapple gall adelgid]] form galls at the base of twigs which resemble miniature pineapples and those of the [[Gall adelgid|Cooley's spruce gall adelgid]] cause cone-shaped galls at the tips of branches. The larva of the [[spruce budworm]] eat the buds and growing shoots while the [[spruce needle miner]] hollows out the needles and makes them coalesce in a webbed mass. An elongated white [[scale insect]], the [[Chionaspis pinifoliae|pine needle scale]] feeds on the needles causing fluffy white patches on the twigs and aphids also suck sap from the needles and may cause them to fall and possibly dieback. Mites can also infest the blue spruce, especially in a dry summer, causing yellowing of the oldest needles.<ref name=IFAS>{{cite web |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/st453 |title=''Picea pungens'': Colorado Spruce |author1=Gilman, Edward F. |author2=Watson, Dennis G. |date=2011-05-01 |work=EDIS |publisher=IFAS Extension Service: University of Florida |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/insect/05514.html |title=Scale Insects Affecting Conifers |author=Cranshaw, W.

It often first attacks trees which have blown over by the wind and when the larvae mature two years afterwards, a major outbreak occurs and vast numbers of beetles attack nearby standing trees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/columngw/gr120421.html |title=Spruce Beetle Threatens High Country Spruce Forests |author=Ciesla, Bill |date=2013-04-19 |publisher=Colorado State University Extension |accessdate=2013-10-05}}</ref>\n\nThe blue spruce is susceptible to several needle casting diseases which cause the needles to turn yellow, mottled or brown before they fall off. Various rust diseases also affect the tree causing yellowing of the needles as well as needle fall. [[Canker]] caused by ''[[Cytospora]]'' attacks one of the lower branches first and progressively makes its way higher up the tree. The first symptom is the needles turning reddish-brown and falling off. Meanwhile, patches of white [[resin]] appear on the bark and the branch eventually dies.<ref name=IFAS/>\n\n===Cultivars===\n[[File:Picea pungens 'Glauca globosa' in Autumn.JPG|thumb|Foliage of the cultivar 'Glauca globosa']]\n\nCommon cultivars (those marked {{smallcaps|agm}} have gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]]):- \n*'Glauca Globosa'{{smallcaps|agm}}<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Picea pungens'' 'Globosa'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1465|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref> - shrub from {{convert|3|-|5|ft|m}} in height<ref>[http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/c825/picea-pungens-glauca-globosa.aspx Missouri Botanical Garden: ''Picea pungens'' 'Glauca Globosa']</ref> \n*'Fat Albert' - compact perfect cone to {{convert|10|ft|m}} of a silver blue color<ref>[http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/e660/picea-pungens-fat-albert.aspx Missouri Botanical Garden: ''Picea pungens'' Fat Albert]</ref>\n*'Glauca Jean's Dilly' - shrub from {{convert|3|-|6|ft|m}} in height<ref>[http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/a421/picea-glauca-jean's-dilly.aspx Missouri Botanical Garden: ''Picea pungens'' 'Glauca Jean's Dilly']</ref>\n*'Glauca Pendula' - drooping branches, spreads to about {{convert|8|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|4|ft|m}} tall<ref>[http://www.finegardening.com/plantguide/picea-pungens-glauca-pendula-colorado-blue-spruce.aspx Fine Gardening Plant Guide: Picea pungens \u2018Glauca Pendula']</ref>\n*'Hoopsii' {{smallcaps|agm}}<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Picea pungens'' 'Hoopsii'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1466|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>\n*'Koster'<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Picea pungens'' 'Koster'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1467|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>\n*'Baby Blue Eyes'<ref>{{cite web|title=Missouri Botanical Garden - ''Picea pungens 'Baby Blueeyes'| url=http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/d137/picea-pungens-baby-blueeyes.aspx}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Washington State University - ''Picea pungens 'Baby Blueeyes'| url=http://www.pnwplants.wsu.edu/PlantDisplay.aspx?PlantID=243}}</ref>\n*'Baby Blue' <ref>{{cite web|title=West Montrose Farms Ltd - ''Picea pungens 'Baby Blue'| url=http://www.babybluespruce.com/}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nThe [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Keresan languages|Keres]] Native Americans used this tree as a traditional [[medicinal plant]] and a ceremonial item, and twigs are given as gifts to bring good fortune.

The seeds often do not germinate till the spring of the second year after maturating.\n\n* Bark: On old trees near the base, furrowed.  Young trees and branches smooth, dark bluish gray, sometimes furrowed, light and dark gray.  Branchlets at first pale green, changing to reddish brown, ultimately dull gray.\n* Wood: Light brown, [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] nearly white; heavy, hard, close-grained, very strong.  Used for levers, handles of tools.  Specific gravity, 0.7286; weight {{convert|45.41|lb}}.\n* Winter buds: Ovate, acute, chestnut brown, {{convert|1/8|in|mm|0}} long.  Inner scales enlarge when spring growth begins.  No terminal bud is formed.\n* Leaves: Alternate, two to four inches long, ovate-oblong, rounded, wedge-shaped, or rarely subcordate and often unequal at base, sharply and doubly serrate, acute or acuminate.  They come out of the bud pale bronze green and hairy; when full grown they are dull deep green above, paler beneath; feather-veined, midrib and veins very prominent on under side.  In autumn bright red, deep scarlet and orange. [[Petiole (botany)|Petioles]] short, slender, hairy.  [[Stipules]] [[caducous]].\n* Flowers: April.  [[Mon\u0153cious]], without [[petal]]s, the [[staminate]] [[spike (botany)|spike]] naked in pendulous [[catkin]]s (aments).  The staminate ament buds are axillary and form in the autumn.

Bitternut hickory is cut and sold in mixture with the true hickories. It is the shortest-lived of the hickories, living to about 200 years.<ref>{{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Carya |species=cordiformis |first=H. Clay |last=Smith |access-date=14 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:BitternutTwig.jpg|thumb|left|Twig of a bitternut]]\n\nIt is a large [[deciduous]] [[tree]], growing up to {{convert|35|m|ft|sp=us|abbr=on}} tall (exceptionally to {{convert|47|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), with a trunk up to {{convert|1|m|ftin|abbr=on}} diameter. The [[leaf|leaves]] are {{convert|15|-|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long, pinnate, with 7\u201311 leaflets, each leaflet lanceolate, {{convert|7|-|13|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long, with the apical leaflets the largest but only slightly so. The [[flower]]s are small wind-pollinated [[catkin]]s, produced in spring. The [[fruit]] is a very bitter [[nut (fruit)|nut]], {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long with a green four-valved cover which splits off at maturity in the fall, and a hard, bony shell. Another identifying characteristic is its bright sulfur-yellow winter bud.\n\nIt is closely related to the [[pecan]], sharing similar leaf shape and being classified in the same section of the genus ''Carya'' sect. ''Apocarya'', but unlike the pecan, it does not have edible nuts. It is most readily distinguished from the pecan by the smaller number of leaflets, with many leaves having only 7 leaflets (rarely fewer than 9, and often 11\u201313, in the pecan). [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrids]] with the pecan are known, and named ''Carya'' \u00d7 ''brownii''. A hybrid between the shagbark hickory (''C. ovata'') is also recognized, and is known as Laney's hickory (''Carya'' \u00d7''laneyi'').<ref>http://www.freefictionbooks.org/books/n/18194-northern-nut-growers-association-report-of-the-pro?start=97</ref>\n[[File:Carya cordiformis NRCS-1.jpg|thumb|right|Bitternut leaf]]\n\n== Habitat ==\n[[File:Carya cordiformis leaves.jpg|thumb|left|Branch of a bitternut hickory with developing nuts]]\nBitternut hickory grows in moist mountain valleys along streambanks and in swamps. Although it is usually found on wet bottom lands, it grows on dry sites and also grows well on poor soils low in nutrients. The species is not included as a titled species in the Society of American Foresters forest cover types because it does not grow in sufficient numbers.\n\n== Range ==\n[[File:Bitternutrangemap.jpg|thumb|left|US range map of ''Carya cordiformis'']]\n\nBitternut hickory grows throughout the eastern United States from southwestern New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and southern Quebec; west to southern Ontario, central Michigan, and northern Minnesota; south to eastern Texas; and east to northwestern Florida and Georgia. It is most common, however, from southern New England west to Iowa and from southern Michigan south to Kentucky. It is probably the most abundant and most uniformly distributed of all the hickories.\n\n== Uses ==\nBitternut is used for lumber and pulpwood. Because bitternut hickory wood is hard and durable, it is used for furniture, paneling, dowels, tool handles and ladders. Like other hickories, the [[wood]] is used for [[smoking (food)|smoking]] [[meat]], and by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for making [[bow (weapon)|bows]]. Bitternut hickory seeds and its bark are eaten by wildlife.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons and category-inline}}\n* {{Wikispecies-inline}}\n* [http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/caco15.htm ''Carya cordiformis'' images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu]*\n* [http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/ClimateChange/2ColumnSubPage/267031.html Ontario Tree Atlas: Bitternut Hickory (Carya Cordiformis)]\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Carya|cordiformis]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Hardwood forest plants]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]",

Other common names are '''pignut''', '''sweet pignut''', '''coast pignut hickory''', '''smoothbark hickory''', '''swamp hickory''', and '''broom hickory'''. The pear-shaped [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] ripens in September and October and is an important part of the diet of many wild animals. The [[wood]] is used for a variety of products, including fuel for home heating.\n\n==Habitat==\n\n===Native range===\nThe range of pignut hickory covers nearly all of eastern United States (11). The species grows in central [[Florida]] and westward through Louisiana and along the [[Gulf Coast]] to [[Alabama]] through [[Mississippi]]. It extends through parts of East [[Texas]] to [[Louisiana]], [[Arkansas]], [[Missouri]] and extreme southeastern [[Iowa]]. Its range further includes [[Massachusetts]] and the southwest corner of [[New Hampshire]] westward through southern [[Vermont]] to central [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan]] and [[Illinois]].\n\nThe best development of this species is in the lower [[Ohio River]] Basin. It prevails over other species of hickory in the [[Appalachia]]n forests. Pignut makes up much of the hickory harvested in [[Kentucky]], [[West Virginia]], the [[Cumberland Mountains]] of [[Tennessee]], and the hill country of the [[Ohio Valley]].\n\nPignut hickory is also found in Canada in southern [[Ontario]]. It does however have a limited range and is restricted to the [[Niagara Peninsula]], southern [[Halton Region]], the [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]\narea along western [[Lake Ontario]], and southward along the northern shore of [[Lake Erie]] and pockets of extreme southwestern Ontario.\n\n===Climate===\nPignut hickory grows in a [[humid]] [[climate]] with an average annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] of 760 to 2,030&nbsp;mm (30 to 80 in) of which 510 to 1,020&nbsp;mm (20 to 40 in) is [[rain]] during the growing season. Average [[snowfall]] varies from little to none in the South to 2,540&nbsp;mm (100&nbsp;in) or more in the mountains of [[West Virginia]], southeastern [[New York (state)|New York]], and southern [[Vermont]] (25).\n\nWithin the range of pignut hickory, [[average annual temperature]]s vary from 7&nbsp;\u00b0C (45&nbsp;\u00b0F) in the north to 21&nbsp;\u00b0C (70&nbsp;\u00b0F) in Florida. Average January temperature varies from -4\u00b0 to 16&nbsp;\u00b0C (25\u00b0 to 60&nbsp;\u00b0F) and average July temperature varies from 21\u00b0 to 27&nbsp;\u00b0C (70\u00b0 to 80&nbsp;\u00b0F). Extremes of 46\u00b0 and -30&nbsp;\u00b0C (115\u00b0 and -22&nbsp;\u00b0F) have been recorded within the range. The [[growing season]] varies by [[latitude]] and [[elevation]] from 140 to 300 days.\n\nMean annual [[relative humidity]] ranges from 70 to 80 percent with small monthly differences; daytime relative humidity often falls below 50% while nighttime humidity approaches 100%.\n\nMean annual [[Insolation|hours of sunshine]] range from 2,200 to 3,000. Average January sunshine varies from 100 to 200 hours, and July sunshine from 260 to 340 hours. Mean daily solar radiation ranges from 12.57 to 18.86 million J m\u00b1 (300 to 450 [[langley (unit)|langley]]s). In January daily radiation varies from 6.28 to 12.57 million J m\u00b1 (150 to 300 langleys), and in July from 20.95 to 23.04 million J m\u00b1 (500 to 550 langleys).\n\nAccording to one classification of climate (20), the range of pignut hickory south of the [[Ohio River]], except for a small area in Florida, is designated as humid, [[mesothermal]]. That part of the range lying north of the Ohio River is designated humid, mesothermal. Part of the species range in peninsular Florida is classed as subhumid, mesothermal. [[Mountain]]s in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee are classed as wet, [[microthermal]], and mountains in South Carolina and Georgia are classed as wet, mesothermal. Throughout its range, precipitation is rated adequate during all seasons.\n\n===Soils and topography===\nPignut hickory frequently grows on dry ridgetops and sideslopes throughout its range but it is also common on moist sites, particularly in the mountains and [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]]. In the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] pignut hickory has been observed on dry sandy soils at low elevations. Whittaker (27) placed pignut in a [[submesic]] class and charted it as ranging up to 1480 m (4,850&nbsp;ft)-the hickory with the greatest elevational range in the Great Smoky Mountains. In southwest Virginia, south-facing upper slopes from 975 to 1050 m (3,200 to 3,445&nbsp;ft) of [[Beanfield Mountain]] are dominated by pignut hickory, northern red oak ''[[Quercus rubra]]''), and white oak (''[[Quercus alba|Q. alba]]''). This site is the most xeric [[habitat]] on the mountain because of high [[insolation]], 70 percent slopes, and medium- to coarse-textured soils derived from [[Clinch sandstone]]. Mid-elevation slopes from 800 to 975 m (2,625 to 3,200&nbsp;ft) are dominated by chestnut oak (''[[Quercus prinus|Q. prinus]]''), northern red oak, and pignut hickory and coincide with three [[shale]] formations (12).\n\nThe range of pignut hickory encompasses 7 [[USDA soil taxonomy|orders]], 12 suborders, and 22 great groups of [[soil]]s (24,25). About two-thirds of the species range is dominated by [[Ultisols]], which are low in bases and have subsurface horizons of [[clay]] accumulation. They are usually moist but are dry during part of the warm season. [[Udults]] is the dominant suborder and [[Hapludults]] and [[Paleudults]] are the dominant great groups. These soils are derived from a variety of parent materials-[[sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rocks|metamorphic]] rocks, [[glacial till]], and in places varying thickness of [[loess]]-which vary in age from [[Precambrian]] to [[Quaternary]].\n\nA wide range of soil fertility exists as evidenced by soil orders-[[Alfisols]] and [[Mollisols]] which are medium to high in base saturation to Ultisols which are low in base saturation (24). Pignut hickory responds to increases in soil nitrogen similarly to American beech (''[[Fagus grandifolia]]''), sugar maple (''[[Acer saccharum]]''), and blackgum (''[[Nyssa sylvatica]]'') (15). These species are rated as intermediate in nitrogen deficiency tolerance and consequently are able to grow with lower levels of nitrogen than are required by \"nitrogen- demanding\" white ash (''[[Fraxinus americana]]''), yellow-poplar (''[[Liriodendron tulipifera]]''), and American basswood (''[[Tilia americana]]''). Hickories are considered \"soil improvers\" because their [[Leaf|leaves]] have a relatively high [[calcium]] content.\n\n===Associated forest cover===\nHickories are consistently present in the broad eastern upland [[Climax vegetation|climax]] forest association commonly called oak-hickory, but they are not generally abundant (18). Locally, hickories may make up to 20 to 30 percent of stand basal area, particularly in slope and cove forests below the [[escarpment]] of the [[Cumberland Plateau]] (23) and in second-growth forests in the [[Cumberland Mountains]], especially on [[Bench (geology)|benches]] (14). It has been hypothesized that hickory will replace chestnut (''[[Castanea dentata]]'') killed by the blight (''[[Cryphonectria parasitica]]'') in the [[Appalachia]]n Highlands (10,12). On [[Beanfield Mountain]] in [[Giles County, Virginia|Giles County]], [[Virginia]], the former chestnut-oak complex has changed to an oak-hickory association over a period of 50 years. This association is dominated by pignut hickory with an importance value of 41.0 (maximum value = 300), northern red oak (36.0), and chestnut oak (25.0). White oak, red maple (Acer rubrum), and sugar maple are subdominant species.\n\nPignut hickory is an associated species in 20 of the 90 forest cover types listed by the [[Society of American Foresters]] for the eastern United States (6):\n\n===Northern forest region===\n\n53 [[Pinus strobus|White Pine]]-[[Quercus prinus|Chestnut Oak]]\n\n===Central forest region===\n\n40 [[Quercus stellata|Post Oak]]-[[Quercus marilandica|Blackjack Oak]] <br/>\n44 [[Quercus prinus|Chestnut Oak]] <br/>\n45 [[Pinus rigida|Pitch Pine]] <br/>\n46 [[Juniperus virginiana|Eastern Redcedar]] <br/>\n52 [[Quercus alba|White Oak]]-[[Quercus velutina|Black Oak]]-[[Quercus rubra|Northern Red Oak]] <br/>\n53 White Oak <br/>\n55 Northern Red Oak <br/>\n57 [[Liriodendron tulipifera|Yellow-Poplar]]-[[Liriodendron|Tulip tree]] <br/>\n59 Yellow-Poplar-White Oak-Northern Red Oak <br/>\n64 [[Sassafras]]-[[Persimmon]] <br/>\n110 Black Oak\n\n===Southern forest region===\n\n75 [[Pinus echinata|Shortleaf Pine]] <br/>\n76 Shortleaf Pine-[[Oak]] <br/>\n78 [[Pinus virginiana|Virginia Pine]]-Oak <br/>\n79 Virginia Pine <br/>\n80 [[Pinus taeda|Loblolly Pine]]-[[Pinus echinata|Shortleaf Pine]] <br/>\n81 Loblolly Pine <br/>\n82 Loblolly Pine-[[Hardwood]] <br/>\n83 Longleaf Pine-[[Pinus elliottii|Slash Pine]]\n\nBecause the range of pignut hickory is so extensive, it is not feasible to list the associated [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, [[Herbaceous|herb]]s, and [[grass]]es, which vary according to [[elevation]], topographic conditions, [[edaphic]] features, and geographic locality.\n\n==Life history==\n[[Image:Pignut-hickory-nut.jpg|thumb|right|Pignut hickory nuts]]\n\n===Reproduction and early growth===\n[[Flowering]] and [[fruit]]ing- Hickories are [[monoecious]] and flower in the spring (3). The [[Stamen|staminate]] [[catkins]] of pignut hickory are 8 to 18&nbsp;cm (3 to 7 in) long and develop from [[axil]]s of leaves of the previous season or from inner scales of the terminal [[bud]]s at the base of the current growth. The [[pistil]]late flowers appear in [[Spike (botany)|spike]]s about 6&nbsp;mm (0.25&nbsp;in) long on [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]s terminating in shoots of the current year. Flowers open from the middle of March in the southeast part of the range to early June in [[New England]]. The catkins usually emerge before the pistillate flowers.\n\nThe [[fruit]] of hickory is [[pear]] shaped and enclosed in a thin husk developed from the floral [[Involucral bract|involucre]]. The fruit ripens in September and October, and [[seed]]s are dispersed from September through December. Husks are green until maturity; they turn brown to brownish-black as they ripen. The husks become dry at maturity and [[Dehiscence (botany)|split away]] from the [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] into four valves along sutures. Husks of pignut hickory split only to the middle or slightly beyond and generally cling to the nut, which is unribbed, with a thick shell.\n\n===Seed production and dissemination===\nPignut hickory begins to bear [[seed]] in quantity in 30 years, with optimum production between 75 and 200 years (16). The maximum age for seed production is about 300 years. Good seed crops occur every year or two with light crops in other years; [[frost]] can seriously hinder seed production (22). Usually less than half of the seeds are sound (2,3), but 50 to 75 percent of these will germinate. The hickory shuckworm (''Laspeyresia caryana'') can seriously reduce [[germination]]. Pignut seed, averaging 440/kg (200/lb), is lighter than the seed of other hickory species. The nuts are disseminated mainly by gravity, but the range of seeding is extended by [[squirrel]]s and [[chipmunk]]s.\n\n===Seedling development===\nHickories exhibit embryo dormancy which is overcome naturally by overwintering in the [[Forest floor|duff]] and [[Plant litter|litter]] or artificially by [[stratification (botany)|stratification]] in a moist medium at 1\u00b0 to 4&nbsp;\u00b0C (33\u00b0 to 40&nbsp;\u00b0F) for 30 to 150 days. In forest tree [[Nursery (horticulture)|nurseries]] unstratified hickory nuts are sown in the fall and stratified nuts are sown in the spring. Hickories are [[hypogeal germination|hypogeously]] germinating plants, and the nuts seldom remain viable in the forest floor for more than one winter (22).\n\nSeedling growth of hickories is slow. The following height growth of pignut hickory seedlings was reported in the Ohio Valley in the open or under light shade, on red [[clay]] soil (2):\n\n{|\n|-\n! Age\n! colspan=\"2\" | Height\n|-\n| (yr) || (cm) || (in)\n|-\n| 1    || 8    || 3.0\n|-\n| 2    || 15   || 5.8\n|-\n| 3    || 20   || 8.0\n|-\n| 4    || 30   || 12.0\n|-\n| 5    || 43   || 17.0\n|}\n\n===Vegetative reproduction===\nHickories sprout readily from [[stump (tree)|stump]]s and [[root]]s. Stump sprouting is not as prolific as in other [[deciduous]] trees species but the sprouts that are produced are vigorous and grow fairly rapidly in height. Root sprouts also are vigorous and probably more numerous than stump sprouts in cut-over areas. Small stumps sprout more frequently than large ones. Sprouts that originate at or below ground level and from small stumps are less likely to develop [[heartwood]] decay. Pignut hickory is difficult to reproduce from [[cutting (plant)|cutting]]s.\n\n===Sapling and pole stages to maturity===\nGrowth and yield- Pignut hickory often grows 24 to 27 m (80 to 90&nbsp;ft) tall and occasionally reaches 37&nbsp;m (120&nbsp;ft), with [[d.b.h.]] of 91 to 122&nbsp;cm (36 to 48 in). The [[bole (botany)|bole]] is often forked. Height and diameter by age are shown in table 1 for selected locations. Diameter growth of pignut hickory (along with [[chestnut oak]], [[white oak]], sweet birch (''[[Betula lenta]]''), and [[American beech]] is rated slow. Since hickories constitute 15 percent or less of the basal area of [[oak]]-hickory forest types, most growth and yield information is written in terms of oak rather than oak-hickory. Yields of mixed oak stands (5,7,19) and of hickory stands (2) have been reported. Tree volume tables are available (2,19).\n\n{|\n|+ Diameter and height of pignut hickory in selected geographic areas (adapted from 2)\n|-\n!Age\n![[D.b.h.]]\n! colspan=\"4\" | Height\n|-\n!\n!S.

The taproot develops early, which may explain the slow growth of seedling shoots. Taproots may develop in compact and stony soils.\n\n===Reaction to competition===\nThe hickories as a group are classed as intermediate in shade tolerance; however, pignut hickory has been classed as intolerant in the Northeast and tolerant in the Southeast. In much of the area covered by mixed oak forests, shade-tolerant [[hardwood]]s (including the hickories) are [[Climax vegetation|climax]], and the trend of [[Ecological succession|succession]] toward this climax is very strong. Although most silvicultural systems when applied to oak types will maintain a hardwood forest, the cutting methods used affects the rapidity with which other species may replace the oaks and hickories (17,18,26).\n\n==Damaging agents==\nPignut hickory is easily damaged by [[Wildfire|fire]], which causes stem degrade or loss of volume, or both. Internal discolorations called mineral streak are common and are one major reason why so few standing hickories meet trade specifications. Streaks result from [[yellow-bellied sapsucker]] pecking, pin [[Wood knot|knot]]s, worm holes, and mechanical injuries. Hickories strongly resist ice damage and seldom develop epicormic branches.\n\nThe Index of Plant Diseases in the United States lists 133 [[fungi]] and 10 other causes of diseases on Carya species (4,9). Most of the fungi are [[saprophyte]]s, but a few are damaging to foliage, produce [[canker]]s, or cause [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] or [[root]] [[Dry rot|rot]]s.\n\nThe most common disease of pignut hickory from Pennsylvania southward is a trunk rot caused by ''Poria spiculosa''. Cankers vary in size and appearance depending on their age. A common form develops around a branch wound and resembles a swollen, nearly healed wound. On large trees these may become prominent [[burl]]-like bodies having several vertical or irregular folds in the callus covering. A single trunk canker near the base is a sign that the butt log is badly infected, and multiple cankers are evidence that the entire tree may be a cull.\n\nMajor leaf diseases are [[anthracnose]] (''Gnomonia caryae'') and [[mildew]] (''Microstroma juglandis''). The former causes brown spots with definite margins on the undersides of the leaf. These may coalesce and cause widespread blotching. Mildew invades the leaves and twigs and may form witches' brooms by stimulating bud formation. Although locally prevalent, mildew offers no problem in the management of hickory.\n\nThe stem [[canker]] (''Nectria galligena'') produces depressed areas with concentric [[bark]] rings that develop on the trunk and branches. Affected trees are sometimes eliminated through breakage or competition and sometimes live to reach merchantable size with cull section at the canker. No special control measures are required, but cankered trees should be harvested in stand improvement operations.\n\nA gall-forming fungus species of ''Phomopsis'' can produce warty excrescences ranging from small twig [[gall]]s to very large trunk [[burl]]s on northern hickories and oaks. Little information is available on root diseases of hickory.\n\nMore than 100 [[insect]]s have been reported to infest hickory trees and [[wood]] products, but only a few cause death or severe damage (1). The hickory [[bark beetle]] (''Scolytus quadrispinosus'') is the most important insect enemy of hickory, and also one of the most important insect pests of hardwoods in the Eastern United States. During [[drought]] periods in the Southeast, outbreaks often develop and large tracts of timber are killed. At other times, damage may be confined to the killing of a single tree or to portions of the tops of trees. The foliage of heavily infested trees turns red within a few weeks after attack, and the trees soon die. There is one generation per year in northern areas and normally two broods per year in the South. Control consists of felling infested trees and destroying the bark during winter months or storing infested logs in ponds.\n\nLogs and dying trees of several hardwood species including pignut hickory are attacked by the [[ambrosia beetle]] (''Platypus quadridentatus'') throughout the South and north to West Virginia and North Carolina. The [[Bostrichidae|false powderpost beetle]] (''Xylobiops basilaris'') attacks recently felled or dying trees, logs, or limbs with bark in the Eastern and Southern States. Hickory, persimmon (''[[Diospyros virginiana]]''), and pecan (''[[Carya illinoinensis|C. illinoinensis]]'') are most frequently infested, but other hardwoods also are attacked. Healthy trees growing in proximity to heavily infested trees are occasionally attacked but almost always without success. Hickory and persimmon wood (useful in the manufacture of small products such as [[shuttle block]]s, [[mallet]]s, and [[Splitting maul|mauls]] is sometimes seriously damaged.\n\nHickory is one of several host species of the [[Longhorn beetle|twig girdler]] (''Oncideres cingulata''). Infested trees and seedlings are not only damaged severely but become ragged and unattractive. A few of the more common species of gall-producing insects attacking hickory are ''[[Phylloxera]] caryaecaulis'', ''[[Caryomyia]] holotricha'', ''C. sanguinolenta'', and ''C. tubicola''.\n\n==Special uses==\nHickories provide food to many kinds of wildlife (8,13). The nuts are relished by several species of [[squirrel]] and represent an estimated 10 to 25 percent of their diet. Nuts and flowers are eaten by the [[wild turkey]] and several species of [[songbird]]s. Nuts and bark are eaten by [[American black bear|black bear]]s, [[fox]]es, [[rabbit]]s, and [[raccoon]]s. Small [[mammal]]s eat the nuts and leaves; 5 to 10 percent of the diet of eastern [[chipmunk]]s is hickory nuts. [[White-tailed deer]] occasionally browse hickory leaves, [[twig]]s, and nuts.\n\nThe kernel of hickory seeds is exceptionally high in crude [[fat]], up to 70 to 80 percent in some species. Crude [[protein]], [[phosphorus]], and [[calcium]] contents are generally moderate to low. Crude [[Dietary fiber|fiber]] is very low.\n\nPignut hickory makes up a small percentage of the [[biomass]] in low-quality upland hardwood stands that are prime candidates for [[clearcutting]] for chips or fuelwood as the first step toward rehabilitation to more productive stands. Hickory has a relatively high heating value and is used extensively as a home heating fuel.\n\nPignut hickory is an important [[shade tree]] in wooded [[suburban]] areas over most of the range but is seldom planted as an [[ornamental tree]] because of its size and difficulty of transplanting, although it has spectacular orangey-red fall colors.\n\n==Genetics==\n''Carya glabra'' var. ''megacarpa'' (Sarg.) Sarg., coast pignut hickory, was once recognized as a distinct variety but is now considered to be a synonym of ''C. glabra'' (Mill.) Sweet. ''C. leiodermis'' Sarg., swamp hickory, has also been added as a synonym of ''C. glabra'' (11).\n\n''Carya glabra'' (Mill.) Sweet var. ''glabra'' distinguishes the (typical) pignut hickory from red hickory (''C. glabra'' var. ''odorata'' (Marsh.) Little). The [[taxonomic]] position of red hickory is controversial. The binomial ''C. ovalis'' (Wangenh.) Sarg. was published in 1913 for a segregate of ''C. glabra''. It was reduced to a [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of ''C. glabra'' in Little's 1953 checklist but was elevated to a [[Variety (botany)|variety]] in the 1979 edition (11). The principal difference is in the husk of the [[fruit]], opening late and only partly, or remaining closed in ''C. glabra'' but promptly [[Dehiscence (botany)|splitting]] to the base in C. ovalis. However, many trees are intermediate in this trait, and the recorded ranges are almost the same. The leaves of ''C. ovalis'' have mostly seven leaflets; those of ''C. glabra'' have mostly five leaflets. The two can be distinguished with certainty only in November. Since the two ranges seem to overlap, the distributions have been mapped together as a Carya glabra-ovalis complex (11).\n\n''Carya ovalis'' has also been treated as an interspecific hybrid between ''C. glabra'' and ''C. ovata''. ''C. ovalis'' was accepted as a polymorphic species especially variable in the size and shape of its nuts and possibly a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]. The relationships may be more complex after a long and reticulate [[phylogeny]], according to detailed [[chemical]] analyses of hickory nut oils.\n\nOne hybrid, ''C.'' x ''demareei'' Palmer (''C. glabra'' x ''cordiformis'') was described in 1937 from northeastern [[Arkansas]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Carya glabra}}\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n#Baker, Whiteford L. 1972.

It is a large, [[deciduous]] [[tree]], growing well over  {{convert|100|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall, and will live more than 350<ref>http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~adk/oldlisteast/#spp</ref> years. The tallest measured shagbark, located in Savage Gulf, Tennessee, is over {{convert|150|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall.  Mature shagbarks are easy to recognize because, as their name implies, they have shaggy bark. This characteristic is, however, only found on mature trees; young specimens have smooth bark.\n\nThe shagbark hickory's nut is edible and has a very sweet taste.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are {{convert|30|-|60|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long, [[pinnate]], with five (rarely three or seven) leaflets, the terminal three leaflets much larger than the basal pair. The shagbark hickory is [[monoecious]]. Staminate flowers are borne on long-stalked [[catkins]] at the tip of old wood or in the axils of the previous season's leaves.  Pistillate flowers occur in short terminal spikes.<ref>Tirmenstein, D. A. 1991. \"Carya ovata.\" In: ''Fire Effects Information System'' [Online].

They are unsuitable to commercial or orchard production due to the long time it takes for a tree to produce sizable crops and unpredictable output from year to year. Shagbark hickories can grow to enormous sizes but are unreliable bearers. The nuts can be used as a substitute for the [[pecan]] in colder climates and have nearly the same culinary function.\n\n''C. ovata'' begins producing seeds at about 10 years of age, but large quantities are not produced until 40 years and will continue for at least 100. Nut production is erratic, with good crops every 3 to 5 years, in between which few or none appear and the entire crop may be lost to animal predation.\n\n[[Andrew Jackson]], the seventh president of the United States, was popularly nicknamed Old Hickory, a play on the toughness of hickory wood. In 1830, he began planning the construction of his tomb at [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]], his plantation in [[Tennessee]]. The grave site was surrounded by a variety of trees, including six shagbark hickories. They stood there for 168 years until a storm in 1998 demolished over 1,200 trees at the site. Work on replanting them remains an ongoing project. In modern times, shagbark hickory is rarely used as an ornamental due to its large size, slow growth, difficulty of transplanting (all Juglandacaea species have large taproots) and nut litter.\n\n\"Hickory\" is derived from ''pawcohiccora'', an Algonquian Indian word for the tree's oily nutmeat.\n<ref name=Hilton />  The nuts were a food source for Native Americans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/carya/species/ovata/ovata.htm |last=Grauke |first=LJ |publisher=Texas A&M University, Department of Horticultural Science |title=Hickories: ''Carya ovata''|accessdate=2013-08-10}}</ref>\n\nShagbark hickory [[wood]] is used for [[smoking (food)|smoking]] [[meat]] and for making the [[bow (weapon)|bows]] of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of the northern area.

''x'' dunbarii'' Sarg.). Shagbark hickory has 32 chromosomes. In general, species within the genus with the same chromosome number are able to cross. Numerous hybrids among the ''Carya'' species with 32 chromosomes (pecan, [[Carya cordiformis|bitternut]], [[Carya laciniosa|shellbark]], and shagbark) have been described, though most are unproductive or have other flaws.  A few [[hican]] varieties are commercially propagated.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{Commons category|Carya ovata}}\n*[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233500320 ''Carya ovata''] at Flora of North America\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/pages/carya-compare-shag.htm Comparison of Shagbark, Southern Shagbark, and Kingnut Hickory] at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/caca38.htm ''Carya carolinae-septentrionalis'' (= ''Carya ovata'' var.

Michael |last2=Rauscher}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology and conservation status ==\nBlack ash commonly occurs in [[swamp]]s,<ref name=\"usfs\" /> often with the closely related [[green ash]]. Its fall foliage is yellow. Black ash is one of the first trees to lose its leaves in the fall.  It is very closely related to [[Fraxinus mandschurica|Manchurian ash]], and will easily hybridize with it. Some consider the two to be geographic isolates of each other.\n\nBlack ash is a food plant for the [[larva]]e of several species of [[Lepidoptera]]; see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on ashes]].\n\nThe species was considered abundant and its survival of little concern prior to the invasion of the [[emerald ash borer]], first detected in North America in 2002.  However, since that time this invasive insect has spread throughout most of the tree's range, and within a few years black ash is expected to be all but extirpated; a similar fate awaits green ash.  In 2014, a U.S. Forest Service agent estimated that \"ninety-nine percent of the ashes in North America are probably going to die.\"  [[Blue ash]] and [[white ash]] are only slightly less affected.<ref>{{cite newspaper |title=After the Trees Disappear |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=30 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\nThis wood is used by Native Americans of the North East for making baskets and other devices. The [[Shakers]] also made extensive use of the Black Ash for creating baskets. Also called Basket Ash, Brown Ash, Swamp Ash, hoop ash, and water ash.\nIt is also a popular wood for making electric guitars and basses, due to its good resonant qualities.<ref>[http://www.jemsite.com/jem/wood.htm Guitar Wood FAQ \u2013 Wood Types & Tones<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== Creating basket strips ==\n[[File:Kelly church black ash basket.jpg|thumb|left|Black ash splint basket by [[Kelly Church]] ([[Odawa]]-[[Ojibwe]])]]\nBlack ash is unique among all trees in North America in that it does not have fibers connecting the growth rings to each other. This is a useful property for basket makers. By pounding on the wood with a mallet, the weaker spring wood layer is crushed, allowing the tougher and darker summer wood layer to be peeled off in long strips. The long strips are trimmed, cleaned, and used in [[basket weaving]]. [[Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands]] also make bark baskets from black ash, traditionally used for berry-gathering.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Fraxinus|nigra]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Western Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of humid continental climate]]\n[[Category:Least concern plants]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]",

That epidemic was the result of a similar overuse of elms in urban environments, leading to a [[monoculture]] that lacked any disease or pest resistance. Scientifically for red ash this is because modern cultivars utilized regionally were parented from sometimes only four individual trees selected for unique traits and male seedless flowering. Proclaiming a harsh lesson learned, cities like Chicago did not replace dead elms with a 1:1 ash:elm ratio. Instead, Norway, silver, red and sugar maples, honey locust, linden/basswood, redbud, crabapples and hackberry, among others, were also utilized during this recovery period and in new urban and suburban areas. Fortunately, with these additional species, many cities were able to reduce the percent of ash and other species to much lower levels (20% average) than during the Dutch elm disease era where from 56% to 100% of the trees were elm.\n\nBoth American elm and green ash were extremely popular due to rapid growth and tolerance of urban pollution and road salt, so many housing developments in [[Michigan]] were lined from end to end with ashes, a result of which the beetles had an enormous food supply to boost their population well above Infestation thresholds. The tree was also extensively propagated and sold by local nurseries. According to the American Nursery Industry, \"Back in the late 1980s, Dr. Frank Santamour Jr., then a research geneticist with the U.S. National Arboretum, proposed the 10-20-30 formula for diversity in the urban forest, limiting the plantings in a community to no more than 10 percent within a single species, 20 percent within a genus and 30 percent within a family.\"\"\u00a0Because of EAB today, many communities  are using a more strict 20 -10-5 rule.\n\nThe emerald ash borer proved to be a far worse and potentially more serious threat than epidemics of the past such as chestnut blight and Dutch elm disease because those diseases spread at a slower rate, only affected one species, and did not kill the trees before they could attain reproductive maturity. Many areas have banned the sale of ash seedlings in nurseries, although seeds may be sold as they are not a vector for the insect.\n\n== Uses ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== Urban ornamental trees ===\n[[File:2014-10-29 13 12 58 Green Ash foliage during autumn coloration in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|thumb|right|Autumn leaf color]]\nGreen ash is one of the most widely planted [[ornamental plant|ornamental trees]] throughout the [[United States]] and much of [[Canada]] but mostly [[Alberta]], including in western areas where it is not native.

Modernizing cities in [[Russia]] and [[China]] then began using imported green ash a century ago to line streets and landscape new public parks.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} When one Chinese city's original collection, which had survived into late 1980's suddenly all died, city fathers used trees by sending them back to America as wooden crates containing Chinese made parts supplying the American auto industry.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Advantages of green ash include its tolerance of harsh urban environmental conditions, ease of propagation, and (in eastern North America) its value for wildlife as a native [[keystone species]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ash Tree Identification|url=http://www.nyis.info/?action=eab_ash_tree_identification|website=New York Invasive Species Information|publisher=Cornell University Cooperative Extension|accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\nGreen ash [[wood]] is similar in properties to [[Fraxinus americana|white ash]] wood, and is marketed together as \"white ash\". The commercial supply is mostly in the South. It is very popular, used in making [[electric guitar]]s because it can be somewhat lighter than white ash without sacrificing too much in tone. It has a bright sound with long sustain, plus the wood grain is aesthetically desirable to many guitar players. [[Gibson]], [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]], [[Ibanez]], [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]], M2Guitars and many other [[luthier]]s use ash in the construction of their guitars.\n\n== References ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{Commons category|Fraxinus pennsylvanica}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Fraxinus|pennsylvanica]]\n[[Category:Trees of humid continental climate]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]\n[[Category:Trees of Western Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1785]]",

Trees with {{convert|7|ft|m|disp=or|abbr=on}} (over mature) class range diameter at breast height were noted in the Imnaha River drainage as late as January 26, 2015.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n== Description ==\n''J. cinerea'' is a [[deciduous]] [[tree]] growing to {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, rarely {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Butternut is a slow-growing species, and rarely lives longer than 75 years.  It has a {{convert|40|\u2013|80|cm|in|abbr=on}} stem diameter, with light gray [[bark]].\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are [[pinnate]], {{convert|40|\u2013|70|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long, with 11\u201317 leaflets, each leaflet {{convert|5|\u2013|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|\u2013|5|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad. The whole leaf is downy-pubescent, and a somewhat brighter, yellower green than many other tree leaves.\n\n=== Flowering and fruiting ===\n[[File:Butternut nut.jpg|left|thumb|A butternut]]\nButternut flowers from April to June, depending upon location, about the same time as the new leaves appear. The species is [[monoecious]]. Male ([[staminate]]) flowers are inconspicuous, yellow-green slender [[catkin]]s that develop from auxiliary buds and female ([[pistillate]]) flowers are short terminal spikes on current year's shoots. Each female flower has a light pink [[stigma (botany)|stigma]]. Flowers of both sexes do not usually mature simultaneously on any individual tree.\n\nThe [[fruit]] is a lemon-shaped [[nut (fruit)|nut]], produced in bunches of two to six together; the nut is oblong-ovoid, {{convert|3|\u2013|6|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|\u2013|4|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad, surrounded by a green husk before maturity in midautumn.\n\nKey characteristics:\n* [[Alternate (botany)|Alternate]], [[compound leaves]]\n* Odd number of [[leaflet (botany)|leaflets]] \u2013 has a terminal leaflet\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n=== Soil and topography ===\nButternut grows best on stream banks and on well-drained soils. It is seldom found on dry, compact, or infertile soils. It grows better than [[black walnut]], however, on dry, rocky soils, especially those of limestone origin.\n\nButternut is found most frequently in coves, on stream benches and terraces, on slopes, in the talus of rock ledges, and on other sites with good drainage. It is found up to an elevation of {{convert|1500|m|ft}} in the Virginias \u2013 much higher altitudes than black walnut.\n\n=== Associated forest cover ===\nButternut is found with many other tree species in several hardwood types in the mixed mesophytic forest. It is an associated species in the following four northern and central forest cover types: sugar maple\u2013basswood, yellow poplar\u2013white oak\u2013northern red oak, beech\u2013sugar maple, and river birch\u2013sycamore. Commonly associated trees include [[basswood]] (''Tilia'' spp.), [[black cherry]] (''Prunus serotina''), [[beech]] (''Fagus grandifolia''), [[black walnut]] (''Juglans nigra''), [[elm]] (''Ulmus'' spp.), [[Tsuga|hemlock]] (''Tsuga canadensis''), [[hickory]] (''Carya'' spp.), [[oak]] (''Quercus'' spp.), [[red maple]] (''Acer rubrum''), [[sugar maple]] (''Acer saccharum''), [[yellow poplar]] (''Liriodendron tulipifera''), [[white ash]] (''Fraxinus americana''), and [[yellow birch]] (''Betula alleghaniensis''). In the northeast part of its range, it is often found with [[sweet birch]] (''Betula lenta'') and in the northern part of its range it is occasionally found with [[white pine]] (''Pinus strobus''). Forest stands seldom contain more than an occasional butternut tree, although in local areas, it may be abundant. In the past, [[West Virginia]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Indiana]], and [[Tennessee]] have been the leading producers of butternut timber.\n\n==== Canopy competition ====\nAlthough young trees may withstand competition from the side, butternut does not survive under shade from above. It must be in the overstory to thrive. Therefore, it is classed as intolerant of shade and competition.\n\n=== Diseases ===\n[[File:Dead Butternuts.jpg|left|thumb|Butternuts killed by [[butternut canker]]]]\n\n==== Butternut canker ====\nThe most serious disease of ''J. cinerea'' is butternut decline or butternut [[canker]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Butternut Canker|url=http://dontmovefirewood.org/gallery-of-pests/butternut-canker.html|work=Gallery of Pests|publisher=Don't Move Firewood|accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref>  In the past, the causal organism of this disease was thought to be a fungus, ''Melanconis juglandis''. Now this fungus has been associated with secondary infections and the primary causal organism of the disease has been identified as another species of fungus, ''[[Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum]]''. The fungus is spread by wide-ranging [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]],{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} so isolation of a tree offers no protection.\n\nSymptoms of the disease include dying branches and stems. Initially, cankers develop on branches in the lower crown. Spores developing on these dying branches are spread by rainwater to tree stems. Stem cankers develop 1 to 3 years after branches die. Tree tops killed by stem-girdling cankers do not resprout. Diseased trees usually die within several years. Completely free-standing trees seem better able to withstand the fungus than those growing in dense stands or forest. In some areas, 90% of the butternut trees have been killed. The disease is reported to have eliminated butternut from North and South Carolina.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The disease is also reported to be spreading rapidly in Wisconsin. By contrast, black walnut seems to be resistant to the disease.\n\n==== Hybrid resistance ====\nThe hybrid between butternut and the [[Juglans ailantifolia|Japanese walnut]] is commonly known as the 'buartnut' and shows resistance to the butternut canker.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Researchers are back-crossing butternut to buartnut, creating 'butter-buarts\" which should have more butternut traits than buartnuts. They are selecting for resistance to the butternut canker.\n\n==== Other pests ====\n[[Bunch disease]] also attacks butternut. Currently, the causal agent is thought to be a [[mycoplasma]]-like organism. Symptoms include a yellow [[witches' broom]] resulting from sprouting and growth of auxiliary buds that would normally remain dormant. Infected branches fail to become dormant in the fall and are killed by frost; highly susceptible trees may eventually be killed. Butternut seems to be more susceptible to this disease than black walnut.\n\nThe common [[grackle]] has been reported to destroy immature fruit and may be considered a butternut pest when populations are high.\n\nButternut is very susceptible to fire damage, and although the species is generally wind firm, it is subject to frequent storm damage.\n\n=== Conservation ===\nThe species is not listed as threatened federally in the US, but is listed as \"Special Concern\" in [[Kentucky]], \"Exploitably Vulnerable\" in [[New York State]], and \"Threatened\" in [[Tennessee]].<ref>[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=JUCI PLANTS Profile for Juglans cinerea (butternut) | USDA PLANTS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe [[Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada]] placed the butternut on the endangered species list in Canada in 2005.<ref name=\"SAR Registry\" />\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Butternut_sections.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Cross-sections from ''[[The American Woods]]'']]\n=== Lumber ===\nButternut wood is light in weight and takes polish well, and is highly rot resistant, but is much softer than [[black walnut]] wood. Oiled, the grain of the wood usually shows much light.  It is often used to make [[furniture]], and is a favorite of woodcarvers.\n\n=== Fabric dye ===\nButternut bark and nut rinds were once often used to dye cloth to colors between light yellow<ref>Snow, Charles Henry.

Page 227.</ref>  To produce the darker colors, the bark is boiled to concentrate the color. This appears to never have been used as a commercial dye, but rather was used to color homespun cloth.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, inhabitants of areas such as [[southern Illinois]] and southern Indiana&nbsp;\u2013 many of whom had moved there from the Southern United States&nbsp;\u2013 were known as \"butternuts\" from the butternut-dyed homespun cloth that some of them wore.  Later, during the [[American Civil War]], the term \"butternut\" was sometimes applied to [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers. Some Confederate uniforms apparently faded from gray to a tan or light brown.  It is also possible that butternut was used to color the cloth worn by a small number of Confederate soldiers.<ref>Saunders, Charles Francis. ''Useful Wild Plants of the United States and Canada''. New York: [[Robert M. McBride]] & Co., 1920. Page 227.</ref>  The resemblance of these uniforms to butternut-dyed clothing, and the association of butternut dye with home-made clothing, resulted in this derisive nickname.\n\n=== Medicinal ===\nButternut bark has mild [[cathartic]] properties {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} and was once used medicinally in place of [[jalap]], a more expensive cathartic which was imported from Mexico.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, a butternut extract made from the inner bark of the tree was used in an attempt to prevent [[smallpox]], and to treat [[dysentery]] and other stomach and intestinal discomfort.<ref>Thatcher, James, M.D. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fHG1rHriGM0C&pg=PA251 ''A Military Journal During the American Revolutionary War''.] Boston: Cottons & Barnard, 1827.

It grows mostly in [[riparian zone]]s, from southern [[Ontario]], west to southeast [[South Dakota]], south to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], northern [[Florida]] and southwest to central [[Texas]]. Wild trees in the upper [[Ottawa Valley]] may be an isolated native population or may have derived from planted trees.\n\nBlack walnut is an important tree commercially, as the wood is a deep brown color and easily worked.  The fruits, walnuts, are cultivated for their distinctive and desirable taste. Often, trees are grown for both lumber and walnuts simultaneously and many cultivars have been developed for improved quality nuts or wood. Black walnut is currently under pressure from the [[thousand cankers disease]] which is causing decline of walnuts in some areas. Black walnut is also [[Allelopathy|allelopathic]] which means that it releases chemicals from roots and other tissues which harm other organisms and give the tree a competitive advantage; this is often undesirable as it can harm garden plants and grasses.\n\n== Description ==\n*'''Odor''' Most parts of the tree including leaves, stems, and fruit [[husk]]s have a very characteristic pungent or spicy odor. This odor is lacking in the nut itself.<ref name=\"peters\" /><ref name=\"dirr\" />\n*'''Trunk''' Height {{convert|30|-|40|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}. Under forest competition, it develops a tall and straight [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]]. When grown in an open area it has a short trunk and broad crown.<ref name=\"dirr\" />\n*'''Bark''' The [[bark]] is typically grey-black and deeply furrowed into thin ridges which gives the bark a diamond shaped pattern.<ref name=\"dirr\" />\n*'''Pith''' The [[pith]] of the twigs is chambered and light brown.<ref name=\"peters\">{{cite book|last1=Peterson|first1=George A.

The terminal buds are ovate, and {{convert|8|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} long, and slightly longer than broad, the lateral buds are smaller and superposed.<ref name=\"dirr\" />\n*'''Leaves''' The leaves are [[compound leaf|compound]] and alternately arranged on the stem. They are {{convert|30|\u2013|60|cm|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long, typically [[even-pinnate]] but there is heavy variation among leaves. The stems have 15\u201323 leaflets, with the largest leaflets located in the center, {{convert|7|\u2013|10|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad.<ref name=\"dirr\">{{cite book|last1=Dirr|first1=Michael A|title=Manual of woody landscape plants.|date=1990|publisher=Stipes Publishing Company|location=Champaign, Illinois|isbn=0-87563-344-7|edition=4. ed., rev.}}</ref> The leaflets have a rounded base and a long pointed ([[acuminate]]) tip as well as having a [[glossary of leaf morphology#serrated|serrated]] edge.<ref name=\"popa\">{{cite book|title=The Plants of Pennsylvania|last2=Block|first2=Timothy|publisher=University of Pennsylvania press|isbn=978-0-8122-4003-0|edition=2|location=Philadelphia Pa|last1=Rhoads|first1=Ann}}</ref> The leaves are overall dark green in color and are typically hairy on the underside.\n*'''Leaf scar''' The [[leaf scar]] has 3 prominent bundle scars and has a notch on the side which points toward the tip of the branch (distal side)\n*'''Flowers''' Black walnut is [[monoecious]]. The '''male''' ([[staminate]]) flowers are in drooping [[catkins]] {{convert|8|\u2013|10|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long. These are borne from axilary buds on the previous year's growth. The '''female''' ([[pistillate]]) flowers are terminal, in clusters of two to five on the current year's growth.<ref name=\":1\" />\n*'''Fruit''' Ripens during the autumn into a fruit (nut) with a brownish-green, semifleshy husk and a brown, corrugated nut. The whole fruit, including the husk falls in October or November; the seed is relatively small and very hard.\n\nThe fruit production tends to occur irregularly with some years producing larger crops than others (see [[mast year]]). Fruiting may begin when the tree is 4\u20136 years old, however large crops take 20 years. Total lifespan of ''J. nigra'' is about 130 years. Black walnut does not leaf out until late spring when the soil has warmed and all frost danger is past. Like other trees of the order [[Fagales]], such as oaks, hickories, chestnuts, and birches, it is monoecious, with wind-pollinated catkins. Male and female flowers are in separate [[spike (botany)|spikes]], and the female flowers typically appear before the male on a single tree ([[dichogamy]]). As a consequence, [[self-pollination]] is unlikely. However, individual trees usually are not self-sterile; if they are not pollinated by neighboring trees, they may set self-fertilized seeds.<ref name=\":1\" /> For maximum seed germination, the seeds should be [[cold-moist stratified]] for 3\u20134 months, although the exact time depends on the seed source.<ref name=\":1\" /> The seedlings emerge in April or May and typically grow {{convert|90|cm|in|round=5|abbr=on}} their first year and even more in the 2nd year.<ref name=\":1\" /> Black walnut often loses its leaves earlier than other deciduous trees growing in the same area after having a growing period of 115\u2013135 days.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBlack walnut has a strong [[taproot]] which makes the seedlings resilient, but difficult to transplant.\n\nBlack walnut is more resistant to frost than the [[English walnut|English]] or [[Persian walnut]], but thrives best in the warmer regions of fertile, lowland soils with high water tables, although it will also grow in drier soils, but much more slowly.<ref name=\"dirr\" /> Some soils preferred by black walnut include A[[Alfisol|lfisol]] and [[Entisol]] soil types.<ref name=\":1\">{{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Juglans |species=nigra |first=Robert D. |last=Williams |access-date=2016-06-29}}</ref> Walnut grows best on sandy loam, loam, or silt loam type soils but will also grow well on silty clay loam soils. It prefers these soils due to the fact that these soils hold large quantities of water which the tree draws from during dry periods.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nVisually, black walnut is similar to the [[butternut tree|butternut]] (''Juglans cinerea'') in leaf shape, and the range also overlaps significantly. The fruits are quite different, and their presence makes an identification easy, as black walnut fruits are round and butternuts are more oval-oblong shaped. When a fruit is not available, two species can be differentiated based on the [[leaf scar]]s, or the place where the leaf meets the stem: butternut has a leaf scar with a flat upper edge and with a velvety ridge above that flat part, but black walnut has an indented leaf scar with no hairy ridge.<ref>{{eFloras|1|116860|Juglans nigra}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nBlack walnut is primarily a [[pioneer species]] similar to [[red maple|red]] and [[silver maple]] and [[black cherry]]. Because of this, black walnut is a common weed tree found along roadsides, fields, and forest edges in the eastern US. It will grow in closed forests, but is classified as shade intolerant, this means it requires full sun for optimal growth and nut production .\n\nThe nuts are food for many rodents and make up to 10% of the diet of [[eastern fox squirrel]]s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/jugnig/all.html|title=Juglans nigra|website=www.fs.fed.us|access-date=2016-06-29}}</ref> The nuts are also eaten by species of birds. The leaves are browsed by [[white tailed deer]],<ref name=\":0\" /> although they are not a preferred food. Squirrels benefit this species by distributing and burying the seeds; if the seeds are not reclaimed by the squirrel, they will germinate and help disperse the species.\n\nWhere the range of the eastern black walnut overlaps that of the Texas black walnut (''[[Juglans microcarpa|J.&nbsp;microcarpa]]''), the two species sometimes interbreed, producing populations with characteristics intermediate between the two species.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/jugmic/all.html|title=Juglans microcarpa|website=www.fs.fed.us|access-date=2016-06-29}}</ref> ''J.nigra'' and ''J. cinerea'' often grow in the same range as well but they do not hybridize naturally.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe tree's roots often form [[endomycorrhiza]]l relationships with fungi in the genus [[Glomus (fungus)|''Glomus'']]. Some endomycorrhizal relations improve the plant's growth.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSpecies often associated with ''J. nigra'' include [[yellow-poplar]] (''Liriodendron tulipifera''), [[white ash]] (''Fraxinus americana''), [[black cherry]] (''Prunus serotina''), [[basswood]] (''Tilia americana''), [[American beech]] (''Fagus grandifolia''), [[sugar maple]] (''Acer saccharum''), [[oak]]s (''Quercus'' spp.), and [[hickory|hickories]] (''Carya'' spp.). Near the western edge of its range, black walnut may be confined to floodplains, where it grows either with [[American elm]] (''Ulmus americana''), [[common hackberry]] (''Celtis occidentalis''), [[green ash]] (''Fraxinus pennsylvanica''), and [[boxelder]] (''Acer negundo''), or with basswood and [[red oak]] (''Quercus rubra'') on lower slopes and other favorable sites.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Uses ==\n{{Nutritional value\n| name            = Walnut, black (''J.&nbsp;nigra'')\n| image           = Black Walnut Juglans nigra Nut 2400px.jpg\n| caption         = Black walnut\n| serving_size    = 100 grams\n| kJ              = 2586\n| carbs           = 9.91&nbsp;g\n| fat             = 59.00&nbsp;g\n| protein         = 24.06&nbsp;g\n| sugars          = 1.10&nbsp;g\n| sucrose         = 1.00&nbsp;g\n| glucose         = 0.05&nbsp;g\n| fructose        = 0.05&nbsp;g\n| satfat          = 3.368&nbsp;g\n| monofat         = 15.004&nbsp;g\n| polyfat         = 35.077&nbsp;g\n| omega3fat       = 2.006&nbsp;g\n| omega6fat       = 33.072&nbsp;g\n| fiber           = 6.8&nbsp;g\n| starch          = 0.24&nbsp;g\n| water           = 4.56&nbsp;g\n| calcium_mg      = 61\n| iron_mg         = 3.12\n| phosphorus_mg   = 513\n| magnesium_mg    = 201\n| manganese_mg    = 3.896\n| sodium_mg       = 2\n| potassium_mg    = 523\n| zinc_mg         = 3.37\n| vitA_ug         = 2\n| vitA_iu         = 40\n| thiamin_mg      = 0.057\n| riboflavin_mg   = 0.130\n| niacin_mg       = 0.470\n| pantothenic_mg  = 1.660\n| vitB6_mg        = 0.583\n| folate_ug       = 31\n| vitB12_ug       = 0\n| vitC_mg         = 1.7\n| vitD_ug         = 0\n| vitD_iu         = 0\n| vitE_mg         = 1.80\n| vitK_ug         = 2.7\n| source          = \n| source_usda     = 1\n}}\n\n=== Planting ===\nWhile its primary native region is the Midwest and east-central United States, the black walnut was introduced into Europe in 1629 and is also cultivated in Hawaii.<ref name=\":0\" /> It is cultivated there and in North America as a forest tree for its high-quality wood. Black walnut plantings can be made to produce timber, nuts, or both timber and nuts.  Patented timber-type trees were selected and released from [[Purdue University]] in the early 1990s.  These trees have been sporadically available from [[Plant nursery|nurseries]]. Varieties include Purdue #1, which can be used for both timber and nut production, though nut quality is poor compared to varieties selected specifically as nut producers.\n\n[[File:2014-10-30 10 16 45 Black Walnut foliage during autumn along Fireside Avenue in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|thumb|left|Autumn foliage]]\n[[Grafting|Grafted]], nut-producing trees are available from several nurseries operating in the U.S.  Selections worth considering include Thomas, Neel #1, Thomas Myers, Pounds #2, Stoker, Surprise, Emma K, Sparrow, S127, and McGinnis.  Several older varieties, such as Kwik Krop, are still in cultivation; while they make decent nuts, they would not be recommended for commercial planting.  A variety index and characteristics guide is available from [http://extension.missouri.edu/p/XM1001 Missouri Extension].\n\nPollination requirements should be considered when planting black walnuts.  As is typical of many species in Juglandaceae, ''Juglans nigra'' trees tend to be [[Sequential hermaphroditism|dichogamous]], i.e.. produce [[pollen]] first and then [[Gynoecium#Pistil|pistillate flowers]] or else produce pistillate flowers and then pollen. An early pollen-producer should be grouped with other varieties that produce pistillate flowers so all varieties benefit from overlap.  Cranz, Thomas, and Neel #1 make a good pollination trio.  A similar group for more northern climates would be Sparrow, S127, and Mintle.\n\nSometimes black walnut is planted as part of reclaiming mines.<ref name=\":0\" /> When growing young trees weed control is critical for healthy establishment of the trees, without weed control the young trees are harmed significantly in their growth rate.\n\n''J. nigra'' is also grown as a specimen ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, growing to {{convert|30|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall by {{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} broad.<ref name=RHSAZ>{{cite book|title=RHS A-Z encyclopedia of garden plants|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1-4053-3296-4|pages=1136}}</ref> It has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref>{{cite web|title=''Juglans nigra''|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=6235|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society|accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Food ===\nBlack walnut nuts are shelled commercially in the United States. About 65% of the annual wild harvest comes from the U.S. state of [[Missouri]], and the largest processing plant is operated by Hammons Products in [[Stockton, Missouri]]. The nutmeats provide a robust, distinctive, natural flavor and crunch as a food ingredient.  Popular uses include ice cream, bakery goods and confections.  Consumers include black walnuts in traditional treats, such as [[cake]]s, [[cookie]]s, [[fudge]], and [[pie]]s, during the fall holiday season.  The nuts' nutritional profile leads to uses in other foods, such as [[salad]]s, [[fish]], [[pork]], [[chicken]], vegetables and pasta dishes.\n\nNutritionally similar to the milder-tasting English walnut, the black walnut kernel is high in unsaturated fat and protein.  An analysis of nut oil from five named ''J.&nbsp;nigra'' cultivars (Ogden, Sparrow, Baugh, Carter and Thomas) showed the most prevalent fatty acid in ''J.&nbsp;nigra'' oil is [[linoleic acid]] (27.80\u201333.34&nbsp;g/100g dry kernel), followed (in the same units) by [[oleic acid]] (14.52\u201324.40), [[linolenic acid]] (1.61\u20133.23), [[palmitic acid]] (1.61\u20132.15), and [[stearic acid]] (1.07\u20131.69).<ref>Senter, S. D., Horvat, R. J., and Forbus, W.

Some take a thick plywood board and drill a nut-sized hole in it (from one to two inches in diameter) and smash the nut through using a hammer.  The nut goes through and the husk remains behind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.extension.illinois.edu/cfiv/homeowners/991002.html|author=Mason, Sandra|title=Preparing Black Walnuts for Eating\n|publisher=University of Illinois Extension|accessdate=2014-07-26}}</ref>\n\nWhile the flavor of the ''Juglans nigra'' kernel is prized, the difficulty in preparing it may account for the wider popularity and availability of the [[Juglans regia|Persian walnut]].\n\n=== Dye ===\nBlack walnut drupes contain [[juglone]] (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), [[plumbagin]] (yellow quinone pigments), and [[tannin]].

The lighter brown cones are from the current season; the darker brown cones are mature cones from previous seasons.]]\nTamaracks are very cold tolerant, able to survive temperatures down to at least {{convert|-65|C|F|0}}, and commonly occurs at the [[Arctic]] [[tree line]] at the edge of the [[tundra]]. Trees in these severe climatic conditions are smaller than farther south, often only {{convert|5|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall. They can tolerate a wide range of soil conditions but grow most commonly in [[swamp]]s, [[bog]]s, or [[muskeg]] in wet to moist organic soils such as [[sphagnum]] [[peat]] and woody peat. They are also found on mineral soils that range from heavy clay to coarse sand; thus texture does not seem to be limiting. Although tamarack can grow well on [[calcareous]] soils, it is not abundant on the [[limestone]] areas of eastern [[Ontario]].\n\n[[File:2015-08-20 17 12 36 Tamarack seedling in a sphagnum bog adjacent to Taborton Road (Rensselaer County Route 42) in Sand Lake, New York.jpg|thumb|upright|Tamarack sapling in a sphagnum bog]]\nTamarack is commonly an early invader.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 |title = Black Spruce |first = C. Michael |last = Hogan |work = GlobalTwitcher.com |date = November 24, 2008 |accessdate = 2011-05-28}}</ref> Tamarack is generally the first forest tree to invade filled-lake bogs. In the lake states, tamarack may appear first in the [[sedge mat]], sphagnum moss, or not until the bog shrub stage. Farther north, it is the pioneer tree in the bog shrub stage. Tamarack is fairly well adapted to reproduce successfully on burns, so it is one of the common [[pioneer species|pioneers]] on sites in the boreal forest immediately after a fire.\n\nThe central [[Alaska]]n population, separated from the eastern [[Yukon]] populations by a gap of about {{convert|700|km|mi}}, is treated as a distinct variety ''Larix laricina'' var. ''alaskensis'' by some botanists, though others argue that it is not sufficiently distinct to be distinguished.\n\n== Associated forest cover ==\n[[File:Tamarack.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Young tree with fall colors]]\nTamarack forms extensive pure stands in the [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] region of [[Canada]] and in northern [[Minnesota]]. In the rest of its [[United States]] range and in the [[Maritime Provinces]], tamarack is found locally in both pure and mixed stands. It is a major component in the [[Society of American Foresters]] (SAF) [[forest cover type]]s Tamarack and [[black spruce\u2013tamarack]].\n\n[[Black spruce]] (''Picea mariana'') is usually tamarack's main associate in mixed stands on all sites. The other most common associates include [[balsam fir]] (''Abies balsamea''), [[white spruce]] (''Picea glauca''), and [[quaking aspen]] (''Populus tremuloides'') in the boreal region. In the better organic soil sites in the northern forest region, the most common associates are the [[northern white-cedar]] (''Thuja occidentalis''), balsam fir, [[Fraxinus nigra|black ash]] (''Fraxinus nigra''), and [[red maple]] (''Acer rubrum''). In [[Alaska]], quaking aspen and tamarack are almost never found together. Additional common associates are [[American elm]] (''Ulmus americana''), [[balsam poplar]] (''Populus balsamifera''), [[jack pine]] (''Pinus banksiana''), [[paper birch]] (''Betula papyrifera''), [[Kenai birch]] (''B. papyrifera'' var. ''kenaica''), and [[yellow birch]] (''B. alleghaniensis'').\n\nTamarack stands cast light shade and so usually have a dense undergrowth of shrubs and herbs. Because the tree has an extensive range, a great variety of shrubs is associated with it. Dominant tall shrubs include [[American dwarf birch|dwarf]] and [[swamp birch]] (''Betula glandulosa'' and ''Betula pumila''), [[willow]]s (''Salix'' spp.), [[speckled alder]] (''Alnus rugosa''), and [[red-osier dogwood]] (''Cornus stolonifera''). Low shrubs include [[bog Labrador tea]] (''Ledum groenlandicum''), [[bog-rosemary]] (''Andromeda glaucophylla''), [[leather leaf]] (''Chamaedaphne calyculata''), and [[small cranberry]] (''Vaccinium oxycoccos''). Characteristically the herbaceous cover includes [[Carex|sedges]] ''(Carex'' spp.), [[cottongrass]] ''(Eriophorum'' spp.), [[three-leaved false Solomonseal]] (''Maianthemum trifolium''), [[marsh cinquefoil]] (''Potentilla palustris''), [[Caltha palustris|marsh-marigold]] (''Caltha palustris''), and [[bogbean]] (''Menyanthes trifoliata''). Ground cover is usually composed of [[sphagnum moss]] ''([[Sphagnum]]'' spp.) and other mosses.\n\n== Flowering and fruiting ==\nTamarack is [[monoecious]].  Male and female flowers are small, either solitary or in groups of 2 or 3, and appear with the needles. Male flowers are yellow and are borne mainly on 1- or 2-year-old branchlets. Female flowers resemble tiny roses.  They are reddish/maroon, have needles at their base which are shorter and bluer than the other needles on the tree.  They are borne most commonly on 2 to 4-year-old branchlets, but may also appear on branchlets 5 or more years old. Cones usually are produced on young growth of vigorous trees. On open-grown trees, cones are borne on all parts of the crown. Ripe cones are brown, oblong-ovoid, and 13 to 19&nbsp;mm (\u00bd to \u00be in) long.\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Larix laricina bonsai by Nick Lenz.jpg|thumb|upright|''Larix laricina'' bonsai]]\nThe [[wood]] is tough and durable, but also flexible in thin strips, and was used by the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] people for making [[snowshoe]]s and other products where toughness was required. The natural crooks located in the stumps and roots are also preferred for creating [[Knee (construction)|knees]] in wooden boats. Currently, the wood is used principally for [[pulpwood]], but also for posts, poles, rough lumber, and fuelwood; Not a major commercial timber species.<ref name=FEIS>{{cite web |title=Larix laricina |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/larlar/all.html |last=Uchytil |first=Ronald J. |year=1991 |publisher=US Forest Service |work=[http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/ Fire Effects Information System]}}</ref>\n\nIt is also grown as an [[ornamental tree]] in gardens in cold regions.

Tamarack trees were used before 1917 in [[Alberta]] to mark the northeast corner of sections surveyed within townships. They were used by the surveyors because at that time the very rot-resistant wood was readily available in the bush and was light to carry.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Their rot resistance was also why they were often used in early water distribution systems.\n\nThe aboriginal peoples of Canada's northwest regions used the inner bark as a poultice to treat cuts, infected wounds, [[frostbite]], boils and hemorrhoids.  The outer bark and roots are also said to have been used with another plant as a treatment for [[arthritis]], cold and general aches and pains.<ref>{{cite book |title=Aboriginal Plant Use in Canada's Northwest Boreal Forest |first=Robin James |last=Marles |publisher=Canadian Forest Service |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-660-19869-9 |page=<!--missing-->}}</ref>\n\nWildlife use the tree for food and nesting.

North Central Forest Experiment Station, St. Paul, MN.</ref>\n\n== Reaction to competition ==\nTamarack is very intolerant of shade. Although it can tolerate some shade during the first several years, it must become dominant to survive. When mixed with other species, it must be in the over story. The tree is a good self-pruner, and boles of 25- to 30-year-old trees may be clear for one-half or two-thirds their length.\n\nBecause tamarack is very shade-intolerant, it does not become established in its own shade. Consequently, the more tolerant black spruce eventually succeeds tamarack on poor bog sites, whereas northern white-cedar, balsam fir, and swamp hardwoods succeed tamarack on good swamp sites. Recurring [[sawfly]] outbreaks throughout the range of tamarack have probably speeded the usual succession to black spruce or other associates.\n\nVarious tests on planting and natural reproduction indicate that competing vegetation hinders tamarack establishment.\n\nThe shade-intolerance of tamarack dictates the use of even-aged management. Some adaptation of clear cutting or seed-tree cutting is generally considered the best [[silvicultural]] system because tamarack seeds apparently germinate better in the open, and the seedlings require practically full light to survive and grow well. Tamarack is also usually wind-firm enough for the seed-tree system to succeed. Satisfactory reestablishment of tamarack, however, often requires some kind of site preparation, such as slash disposal and [[herbicide]] spraying.\n\n== Damaging agents ==\nThe tamarack has thin bark and is therefore highly susceptible to fire damage, except perhaps in older, upland stands. However, the habitat of tamarack, especially south of the [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] forest, is normally wet enough to protect the tree from fire. The tamarack is also susceptible to high winds. Strong winds can uproot large tamarack trees growing in swamps or other wet-land sites where rooting is shallow. It has also been discovered that abnormally high water levels often kill tamarack stands. Those that survive under such conditions usually grow very slowly. Other effects of high water include dieback and the development of adventitious roots and shoots. Wetland road crossings and beaver damming are the primary causes of flooding.\n\nMany insect species are known to be destructive to tamaracks. The [[larch sawfly]] is the most destructive. Epidemics occur periodically across [[Canada]] and the northern [[United States]] and have caused tremendous losses of merchantable tamarack throughout most of the tree's range. Indications are that radial increment declines markedly after 4 to 6 years of outbreak. After 6 to 9 years of moderate to heavy defoliation, the trees die. In southeastern [[Manitoba]] and northern [[Minnesota]], however, imported parasites of the sawfly have become established and should reduce the frequency and duration of future outbreaks. Another serious defoliator is the [[larch casebearer]] ''[[Coleophora laricella]]''. The [[larch casebearer]] attacks tamarack of all ages, and several severe outbreaks have caused extensive mortality in some areas. Outbreak severity has lessened in recent years, however, probably due to imported parasites of the casebearer that have become widely established.\n\nOnly a few other insects and related organisms (such as [[mites]]) that feed on tamarack are known to sometimes cause serious injury. During an outbreak, the [[spruce budworm]] (''[[Choristoneura fumiferana]]'') can severely damage tamarack. The [[larch-bud moth]] (''[[Zeiraphera improbana]]'') has had occasional short epidemics, and the [[spruce spider mite]] (''[[Oligonychus ununguis]]'') is occasionally found in large numbers on tamarack. The [[Argyresthia laricella|larch-shoot moth]] ''([[Argyresthia laricella]])'' is widely distributed, but serious injury is unusual. One of the most common bark beetles attacking tamarack is the [[eastern larch beetle]] (''[[Dendroctonus simplex]]''), but it feeds mainly on weakened, dying, or dead trees.\n\nTamarack is a host to many pathogens, but only one cause diseases serious enough to have an economic impact on its culture, the ''[[Lachnellula willkommii]]'' fungus. It is a relatively new pathogen in Canada, first recorded in 1980 and originating in Europe. The fungus cause large [[canker]]s to form and a disease known as [[Larch#Diseases|Larch Canker]] which is particularly harmful to the tamarack larch, killing both young and mature trees.<ref>[http://www.exoticpests.gc.ca/es-details/disease/1000096 European larch canker] Natural Resources Canada</ref> Apart from this, the only common foliage diseases are rusts, such as the leaf rust in eastern and central North America.

Throughout the greater part of its range, white spruce routinely survives and is undamaged by winter temperatures of {{convert|\u221250|C|F}}, and even lower temperatures occur in parts of the range (Fowells 1965, Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990).<ref name=\"SilvicsNA\" /><ref name=\"fowells\"/> [[Taiga|Boreal]] ''Picea'' are among the few extremely hardy [[Pinophyta|conifers]] in which the bud primordia are able to survive temperatures down to {{convert|-70|C|F|disp=comma}} (Sakai and Larcher 1987).<ref name=\"sakai4\">Sakai, A.; Larcher, W. (Eds.) 1987. Frost Survival of Plants. Springer-Verlag, New York NY. 321 p.</ref>\n\nEspecially important in determining the response of white spruce to low temperatures is the physiological state of the various tissues, notably the degree of \"hardening\" or dormancy.

Springer-Verlag, New York NY.</ref> First, classical definitions generally connote directional changes in species composition and community structure through time, yet the time frame needed for documentation of change far exceeds an average lifespan (Solomon et al. 1981).<ref name=\"solo\" /> The second feature that defies quantitative description is the end point or climax.\n\nFloodplain deposits in the Northwest Territory, Canada, are important in relation to the development of productive forest types with a component of [[white spruce]] (Jeffrey 1964).<ref name=\"jeff2\"/> The most recently exposed surfaces are occupied by sandbar vegetation or riparian shrub willows and alder (''Alnus incana''); with increasing elevation, the shrubs give way successively to [[Populus balsamifera|balsam poplar]] and white spruce forest. In contrast, older floodplains, with predominantly brown wooded soils, typically carry white spruce\u2013[[Populus tremuloides|trembling aspen]] mixedwood forest.\n\nInterrelationships among nutrient cycling, regeneration, and subsequent forest development on floodplains in interior Alaska were addressed by Van Cleve et al. (1980),<ref name=\"van1\">Van Cleve, K.; Dyrness, R.; Viereck, L. 1980. Nutrient cycling in interior Alaska flood plains. p. 11\u201318 ''in'' Murray, M.; Van Veldhuizen, R.M. (Eds.). Proc.

Thus, each successional stage has a species combination in harmony with site quality. Short-circuiting succession by planting a late successional species such as white spruce on an early successional surface may result in markedly reduced growth rates because of [[Nitrogen deficiency|nitrogen insufficiency]]. Without application of substantial amounts of fertilizer, use would have to be made of early successional alder and its site-ameliorating additions of nitrogen.\n\nNeiland and Viereck noted that \u201cthe slow establishment and growth of spruce under birch stands [in Alaska] may be partially due to effects of shading and general competition for water and nutrients, but may also be more directly related to the [[birch]] itself.

Succession follows in one of two general patterns. In most cases, aspen and birch develop as a successional stage after [[Wildfire|fire]] before reaching the spruce stage. But, occasionally, with optimal site conditions and a source of seed, white spruce will invade with the [[hardwood]]s or within a few years thereafter, thereby producing even-aged white spruce stands without an intervening hardwood stage.\n\n== Associated forest cover ==\nThe White Spruce Cover Type may include other species in small numbers. In Alaska, associates include paper birch, trembling aspen, balsam poplar, and black spruce; in western Canada, additional associates are subalpine fir, balsam fir, Douglas-fir, jack pine, and lodgepole pine (Dyrness 1980).<ref name=\"vier1\">Dyrness, C.T. 1980.

On certain river bottom sites, however, black spruce may replace white spruce (Viereck 1970a).<ref name=\"vier1\"/> Earlier successional stages leading to the white spruce climax are the white spruce\u2013paper birch, white spruce\u2013aspen, balsam poplar, jack pine, and lodgepole pine types. The type shows little variation. The forest is generally closed and the trees well formed, other than those close to the timberline. Lesser vegetation in mature stands is dominated by [[moss]]es. [[Vascular plant]]s are typically few, but [[shrub]]s and [[herb]]s that occur \u201cwith a degree of regularity\u201d include: alder, willows, mountain cranberry, red-fruit bearberry, black crowberry, prickly rose, currant, buffaloberry, blueberry species, bunchberry, twinflower, tall lungwort, northern comandra, horsetail, bluejoint grass, sedge species, as well as ground-dwelling [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s. Several white spruce communities have been identified in interior Alaska: white spruce/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/sphagnum; white spruce/avens/moss; and white spruce/alder/bluejoint (Viereck 1975, Dyrness 1980).<ref>Viereck, L.A. 1975.

Through much of its range it averages {{convert|5|\u2013|15|m|round=5|abbr=on}} tall with a trunk {{convert|15|\u2013|50|cm|0|abbr=on}} diameter at maturity, though occasional specimens can reach {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}} diameter.

Numerous differences in details of its needle and [[pollen]] morphology also exist but require careful microscopic examination to detect. From true firs, such as ''[[Abies balsamea]]'' (balsam fir), it differs in having pendulous cones, persistent woody leaf-bases, and four-angled needles, arranged all round the shoots.\n\nDue to the large difference between [[heartwood]] and [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] moisture content, it is easy to distinguish these two wood characteristics in [[ultrasound]] images,<ref name=BlackSpruce>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wei | first1 = Q. | last2 = Chui | first2 = Y.

In the [[Great Lakes States]] it is most abundant in peat [[bogs]] and swamps, also on transitional sites between peatlands and uplands. In these areas it is rare on uplands, except in isolated areas of northern [[Minnesota]] and the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]].\n\n[[File:Picea mariana taiga.jpg|thumb|left|Black spruce taiga, Copper River, Alaska.]]\nMost stands are even-aged due to frequent fire intervals in black spruce forests. It commonly grows in pure stands on organic soils and in mixed stands on mineral soils. It is tolerant of nutrient-poor soils, and is commonly found on poorly drained acidic [[peatlands]]. It is considered a [[climax species]] over most of its range; however, some ecologists question whether black spruce forests truly attain climax because fires usually occur at 50 to 150 year intervals, while \"stable\" conditions may not be attained for several hundred years.<ref name=farjon />\n\nThe frequent fire return interval, a natural [[fire ecology]], perpetuates numerous successional communities. Throughout [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] [[North America]], ''[[Betula papyrifera]]'' (paper birch) and ''[[Populus tremuloides]]'' (quaking aspen) are successional hardwoods that frequently invade burns in black spruce. Black spruce typically seeds in promptly after fire, and with the continued absence of fire, will eventually dominate the hardwoods.\n\nIt is a pioneer that invades the sedge mat in filled-lake bogs, though often preceded slightly by  ''[[Larix laricina]]'' (tamarack), with which it may in time form a stable forest cover in swamps. However, as the peat soil is gradually elevated by the accumulation of organic matter, and the fertility of the site improves, Balsam Fir and ''[[Thuja occidentalis]]'' (eastern arborvitae) will eventually replace black spruce and tamarack.\n\nThe larvae of the [[spruce budworm]] [[moth]] cause defoliation which will lead to death if it occurs several years in a row, though black spruce is less susceptible than white spruce or balsam fir. Trees most at risk are those growing with balsam fir and white spruce.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nNumerous [[cultivars]] have been selected for use in parks and gardens.

North of Oregon, its range extends inland along river floodplains, but nowhere does its range extend more than {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Pacific Ocean and its inlets.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Bucked Spruce.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Felled Sitka spruce, [[Oregon Coast Range]], 1918]]\nSitka spruce is of major importance in [[forestry]] for [[timber]] and [[paper]] production. Outside its native range, it is particularly valued for its fast growth on poor soils and exposed sites where few other trees can be grown successfully; in ideal conditions, young trees may grow {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} per year. It is naturalized in some parts of Ireland and Great Britain, where it was introduced in 1831<ref>(Mitchell, 1978)</ref> and New Zealand, though not so extensively as to be considered [[invasive species|invasive]]. Sitka spruce is also planted extensively in Denmark, Norway, and [[Iceland]].<ref>Dammert, L (2001).

It can be found in two pockets along the St Lawrence River in southern Quebec and Ontario and more prominently occurs from central Maine south to Georgia and as west as Kentucky. It is found in places where other species would find unsuitable for growth such as acidic, sandy, and low nutrient soils. This species occasionally hybridizes with other pine species such as loblolly pine (''[[Pinus taeda]]''), shortleaf pine (''[[Pinus echinata]]''), and pond pine (''[[Pinus serotina]]''); the last is treated as a [[subspecies]] of pitch pine by some [[botanist]]s.\n\n==Distribution==\nPitch pine is found mainly in the southern areas of the [[northeastern United States]], from coastal [[Maine]] and [[Ohio]] to [[Kentucky]] and northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. A few stands occur in southern [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]]. It is known as a pioneer species and is often the first tree to vegetate a site after it has been cleared away. In extreme conditions, it is a climax vegetation type. But in most cases, it is replaced by oaks and other hardwoods. This pine occupies a variety of habitats from dry acidic sandy uplands to swampy lowlands, and can survive in very poor conditions; it is the primary tree of the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|New Jersey Pine Barrens]].<ref name=\"Moore2008\">{{cite book |last=Moore |first=Gerry |last2=Kershner |first2=Bruce |display-authors=2 |first3=Craig |last3=Tufts |first4=Daniel |last4=Mathews |first5=Gil |last5=Nelson |last6=Spellenberg |first6=Richard |last7=Thieret |first7=John W. |first8=Terry |last8=Purinton |last9=Block |first9=Andrew |title=National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Trees of North America |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |year=2008 |page=756 |isbn=1-4027-3875-7}}</ref>\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nScientific name:\u00a0''Pinus rigidia''\u00a0\n\nIt was given its name by British botanist\u00a0[[Philip Miller]]. It belongs to the Pinaceae family and the subgenus Diploxyon along other hard pines\n\n==Description==\nIt is irregular in shape, branches are usually twisted and it does a poor job at self-pruning. The needles are in fascicles of three, about {{convert|6|-|13|cm|abbr=on}} in length, and are stout (over {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on}} broad) and often slightly twisted. The cones are {{convert|4|-|7|cm|abbr=on}} long and oval with prickles on the scales. Trunks are usually straight with a slight curve to them, they are covered in irregular, thick, large plates of bark. Pitch pine has an exceptionally high regenerative ability; if the main trunk is cut or damaged by fire it can re-sprout using [[epicormic shoots]]. This is one of its many adaptations to fire, which also includes a thick bark to protect the sensitive [[Cork cambium|cambium layer]] from heat. Burnt trees often form stunted, twisted trees with multiple trunks as a result of the resprouting. This characteristic also makes it a popular species for [[bonsai]].\n\nPitch pine is rapid-growing when young, gaining around one foot of height per year under optimal conditions until the tree is 50\u201360 years old, whereupon growth slows. By 90 years of age, the amount of annual height gain is minimal. Open-growth trees begin bearing cones in as little as three years, with shade-inhabiting pines taking a few years longer. Cones take two years to mature and seed dispersal occurs over the fall and winter and trees cannot self-pollinate. The total lifespan of pitch pine is about 200 years.\n\n== Role in ecosystem ==\nPitch pine provides a habitat and offers food for many wildlife species. They are used as cover and nesting for birds such as the\u00a0[[Pine warbler]],\u00a0[[Wild turkey]],\u00a0[[red-cockaded woodpecker]],\u00a0[[Great crested flycatcher|great-crested flycatchers]],\u00a0[[blue jay]]s,\u00a0[[black-capped chickadee]]s,\u00a0[[black-and-white warbler]]s,\u00a0[[Nashville warbler|Nashville warblers,]]\u00a0and\u00a0[[chestnut-sided warbler]]s. Deer consume seedlings and new sprouts. and small mammals and birds eat the seeds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us|title=US Forest Service|website=www.fs.fed.us|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nPitch pine is not a major timber tree due to the frequency of multiple or crooked trunks; nor is it as fast-growing as other eastern American pines. However, it grows well on unfavorable sites. In the past, it was a major source of [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and timber for ship building, mine timbers, and railroad ties because the wood's high resin content preserves it from decay. Pitch pine wood was also used for building radio towers in Germany, as at [[transmitter Muehlacker|Muehlacker]] and [[transmitter Ismaning|Ismaning]].\n\nPitch pine is currently used mainly for rough construction, pulp, crating, and fuel. However, due to its uneven growth, quantities of high quality can be very sought after, and large lengths of pitch pine can be very costly.\n\nAcheology indicates that the\u00a0[[Iroquois]],\u00a0[[Shinnecock Indian Nation|Shinnecock]], and\u00a0[[Cherokee]]\u00a0all utilized pitch pine. The Iroquois used the pitch to treat rheumatism, burns, cuts, and boils. Pitch also worked as a laxative. A pitch pine poultice was used by both the Iroquois and the Shinnecock to open boils and to treat abscesses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treesforme.com.|title=North American Native Trees|website=www.treesforme.com.|access-date=2017-05-01}}</ref> The Cherokee used pitch pine wood in canoe construction and for decorative carvings.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:2013-05-10 09 02 57 Pitch Pine new growth and pollen cones along the Batona Trail in Brendan T.

Leaves are similar to ''[[Populus tremuloides]]'', but slightly larger and having larger teeth.<ref>{{cite book |title=Trees and Shrubs of Minnesota: the Complete Guide to Species Identification |first=Welby R. |last=Smith |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |date=2008 }}</ref>  The leaves tremble in the wind as ''P. tremuloides'' does.  Bark of younger trees is olive-green, thin and smooth; after 30\u201340 years, the bark is grey, thick and rough with grooves.\n\n== Reproduction ==\nBigtooth aspens produce seeds from the flower clusters, known as [[catkin]]s. The seed, a two-valved capsule, is distributed widely by the wind. Individuals can also reproduce through the roots after a disturbance event, such as fire or harvest; the roots of the dead/cut tree will begin to send up suckers, creating identical individuals, and can result in a stand of clones that resemble that individual.<ref name=\"rook.org\">http://www.rook.org/earl/bwca/nature/trees/populusgrand.html</ref>\n\n== Growth ==\nBigtooth aspens are [[dioecious]], medium-sized deciduous trees with straight trunks and gently ascending branches. Heights at maturity are around {{convert|60|\u2013|80|ft|m}} with diameters of {{convert|8|\u2013|10|in|cm}}. They are fast growing and are relatively short-lived; stands will begin to deteriorate after 60\u201370 years, while individuals can live up to 100 years. They often constitute early successional species of their landscapes.  Roots are shallow and wide spreading; lateral root growth in a forest may be as far as {{convert|60|ft}}.<ref name=\"rook.org\" /> Generally, four to five lateral roots originate from the tree, and then branch within {{convert|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}}; vertical, penetrating roots near the base anchor the tree.\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe range of ''Populus grandidentata'' extends from Virginia north to Maine and Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia; west to southeastern Manitoba and Minnesota; south through Iowa to extreme northeastern Missouri; and east through Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and West Virginia.  Disjunct populations are found in Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina.<ref>http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/popgra/all.html</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe species is able to adapt to a wide range of soils, though it is most abundant on sands, loamy sands and light sandy loams.  Big-tooth aspens can tolerate sandy uplands and high, rocky sites. The depth to the water table is generally about {{convert|5|ft}}.<ref>{{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Populus |species=grandidentata |first=Paul R. |last=Laidly}}</ref> Soil must be moist but well-aerated for good growth. Being very shade intolerant, most shaded stems die. They are pioneer species on disturbed sites, persisting in successional communities until senescence. Rapid height growth of suckers allows it to outcompete other sprouting species such as [[red oak]] (''Quercus rubra'') and [[red maple]] (''Acer rubrum'') on many sites. In the absence of disturbance, it is soon replaced by conifers and hardwoods. In the Great Lakes Region at the turn of the 20th century, many mature pine forests were logged and burned. Bigtooth and quaking aspens frequently dominated the postdisturbance forests. Without fire or other disturbance, these forests are being replaced by later successional, shade-tolerant species. This aspen usually grows in even-aged, mixed stands, most commonly with quaking aspens. Codominant in both hardwood and conifer forests, it does not occur as a subdominant because of its extreme shade intolerance. [[Quaking aspen]] (''Populus tremuloides'') is the predominant species in aspen stands in the Great Lakes region, but bigtooth aspen dominates on drier, upland sites. Aspen stands dominated by bigtooth aspens are generally more open than those dominated by quaking aspens. It is more disease resistant than ''P. tremuloides''. The most serious disease is hypoxylon canker (caused by ''[[Entoleuca mammata]]''). Other rots, fungi, and root decay affect this species. A preferred host of [[gypsy moth]], death occurs when nearly complete defoliation by gypsy moths is followed by a fungal infection by ''[[Armillaria]]'' spp. The ambrosia beetle (''[[Xyleborus saxesceni]]'') attacks fire-damaged bigtooth aspens. Commonly, it occurs in areas that frequently burn, such as large upland areas distant from water and upwind of natural fire breaks, such as lakes.\n\n== Uses ==\nThe wood is light-colored, straight-grained, fine-textured, and soft. It is used primarily for pulp, but can be used to make particle board and structural panels. Minor uses include log homes, pallets, boxes, match splints, chopsticks, hockey stick components, and ladders.  The bark is pelletized for fuel and supplemental cattle feed.\n\n== References ==\n{{USGovernment|sourceUrl=https://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/silvics_manual/Volume_2/populus/grandidentata.htm}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{PLANTS|symbol=POGR4|name=Populus grandidentata}}\n* [http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Populus+grandidentata University of Michigan at Dearborn: Native American Ethnobotany of ''Populus grandidentata'']\n\n[[Category:Populus|grandidentata]]\n[[Category:Flora of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Trees of temperate climates]]\n[[Category:Plants used in traditional Native American medicine]]",

It is a common element of America's north central and northeastern mixed forests. It can survive in a variety of habitats. It forms [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] with [[bur oak]] where they occur together in the wild.\n\n== Description ==\n''Quercus bicolor'' grows rapidly and can reach {{convert|60|to|80|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} tall with the tallest known reaching {{convert|29|m|ft|abbr=on}} <ref>Muhlenberg, Ges. Naturf. Freunde Berlin Neue Schriften. 3: 396. 1801.</ref> and lives up to 350 years.\nThe [[bark]] resembles that of the white oak. The [[leaf|leaves]] are broad [[ovoid]], {{convert|12|\u2013|18|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|7|-|11|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad, always more or less glaucous on the underside, and are shallowly lobed with five to seven lobes on each side, intermediate between the [[chestnut oak]] and the [[Quercus alba|white oak]].   In autumn, they turn brown, yellow-brown, or sometimes reddish, but generally, the color is not as reliable or as brilliant as the white oak can be. The [[fruit]] is a [[peduncle (botany)|peduncled]] [[acorn]], {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} (rarely {{convert|2.5|cm|in|disp=or|abbr=on}}) long and {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} broad, maturing about 6 months after pollination.<ref name=tammy>{{eFloras|1|233501012|Quercus bicolor}}</ref>\n\n{{Gallery\n|Image:Quercus bicolor JPG1L.jpg|Leaves\n|File:Swamp White Oak Quercus bicolor Bark Closeup Vertical.JPG|Bark\n}}\n\n== Habitat ==\nThe swamp white oak generally occurs singly in four different forest types: black ash-American elm-red maple, silver maple-American elm, bur oak, and pin oak-sweetgum. Occasionally the swamp white oak is abundant in small areas. It is found within a very wide range of mean annual temperatures from {{convert|16|to|4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. Extremes in temperature vary from {{convert|41|to|-34|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. Average annual precipitation is from {{convert|640|to|1270|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The frost-free period ranges from 210 days in the southern part of the growing area to 120 days in the northern part.\nThe swamp white oak typically grows on hydromorphic soils. It is not found where flooding is permanent, although it is usually found in broad stream valleys, low-lying fields, and the margins of lakes, ponds, or sloughs.\n\n== Range ==\nSwamp white oak, a lowland tree, is widespread in the eastern and central United States and eastern and central Canada, from [[Nova Scotia]] to [[South Carolina]], west as far as [[Ontario]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Tennessee]] with a few isolated populations in [[Nebraska]] and [[Alabama]]. This species is most common and reaches its largest size in western [[New York (state)|New York]] and northern [[Ohio]].<ref>{{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Quercus |species=bicolor |accessdate=14 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{BONAP|ref|genus=Quercus|species=bicolor}}</ref>\n\n== Cultivation and uses ==\nIt is one of the more important white oaks for [[lumber]] production. In recent years, the swamp white oak has become a popular landscaping tree, partly due to its relative ease of transplanting.\n\nBeing in the white oak group, wildlife such as deer, ducks, and geese, as well as other animals are attracted to this tree when acorns are dropping in the fall.\n\n== Cultivars ==\n''Quercus robur fastigiata x Quercus bicolor'' 'Nadler' [[Kindred Spirit Hybrid Oak]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=QUBI USDA Plants Profile for ''Quercus bicolor'']\n*[http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_2/quercus/bicolor.htm USDA National Forest Service, Silvic Manual: ''Quercus bicolor'']\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/qubi.htm ''Quercus bicolor'' images from Vanderbilt University]\n*[http://www.tropicos.org/ImageFullView.aspx?imageid=100293574 photo of herbarium specimen at Missouri Botanical Garden, collected in Missouri in 1934]\n{{Commons|position=left|Quercus bicolor}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n\n[[Category:Quercus|bicolor]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of humid continental climate]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1801]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Ludwig Willdenow]]",

''Quercus''). The species was often called ''Quercus acuminata'' in older literature. ''Quercus muehlenbergii'', (its specific epithet often misspelt ''muhlenbergii'') is native to eastern and central [[North America]], ranging from [[Vermont]] west to [[Wisconsin]] and south to [[South Carolina]], western [[Florida]], [[New Mexico]], and northeastern [[Mexico]] from [[Coahuila]] south to [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]].<ref>{{BONAP|ref|genus=Quercus|species=muehlenbergii}}</ref>\n\n== Classification and nomenclature ==\n[[File:MuhlenbergGotthilf.jpg|thumb|left|Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg, for whom ''Quercus muehlenbergii'' was named (portrait by [[Charles Willson Peale]], 1810)]]\nSince its recognition as a different species from the similar-appearing [[Quercus prinus|chestnut oak (''Quercus prinus'')]], ''Q. muehlenbergii'' has generally been regarded as a distinct species; no subspecies or varieties are currently recognized within it, although a few infraspecific variants had been accepted in the past.\n\nThe tree's scientific name honors [[Gotthilf Heinrich Ernst Muhlenberg]] (1753\u20131815), a [[Lutheran]] pastor and amateur botanist in [[Pennsylvania]]. In publishing the name ''Quercus m\u00fchlenbergii'', [[Germany|German]]-[[United States|American]] [[botanist]] [[George Engelmann]] mistakenly used an [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] in spelling Muhlenberg's name, even though Pennsylvania-born Muhlenberg himself did not use an umlaut in his name. Under the modern [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|rules of botanical nomenclature]], umlauts are transliterated, with \"\u00fc\" becoming \"ue\", hence Engelmann's ''Quercus m\u00fchlenbergii'' is now presented as ''Quercus muehlenbergii''. In lack of evidence that Engelmann's use of the umlaut was an unintended error, and hence correctable, the ''muehlenbergii'' spelling is considered correct, although the more appropriate [[orthography|orthographic variant]] ''Quercus muhlenbergii'' is often seen.<ref name=\"NS Q.muehl.\">{{cite web|title=Quercus muehlenbergii|url=http://www.natureserve.org/explorer/servlet/NatureServe?sourceTemplate=tabular_report.wmt&loadTemplate=species_RptComprehensive.wmt&selectedReport=RptComprehensive.wmt&summaryView=tabular_report.wmt&elKey=131052&paging=home&save=true&startIndex=1&nextStartIndex=1&reset=false&offPageSelectedElKey=131052&offPageSelectedElType=species&offPageYesNo=true&post_processes=&radiobutton=radiobutton&selectedIndexes=131052|work=NatureServe Explorer|publisher=NatureServe|accessdate=7 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe low-growing, [[cloning]] [[Quercus prinoides|''Q. prinoides'' (dwarf chinkapin oak)]] is similar to ''Q. muehlenbergii'' and has been confused with it in the past, but is now generally accepted as a distinct species.<ref Name=\"FNA Qprinoides\">{{eFloras|1|233501075|Quercus prinoides|accessdate=8 October 2011}}</ref> If the two are considered to be [[conspecific]], the earlier-published name ''Quercus prinoides'' has priority over ''Q. muehlenbergii'', and the larger chinkapin oak can then be classified as ''Quercus prinoides ''var.'' acuminata'', with the dwarf chinkapin oak being ''Quercus prinoides ''var.'' prinoides''. ''Q. prinoides'' was named and described by the German botanist [[Carl Ludwig Willdenow|Karl (Carl) Ludwig Willdenow]] in 1801, in a German journal article by Muhlenberg.<ref name=tammy />\n\n== Description ==\n{{expand section|date=October 2011}}\nKey characteristics of ''Quercus muehlenbergii'' (chinkapin oak):<ref>Barnes, B.

The acorns turn chestnut brown in the fall.<ref name=tammy />\n*The leaves have sharp teeth but no bristles, as a member of the [[Quercus|white oak subgenus of ''Quercus'']].<ref name=tammy />\n\nChinkapin oak is [[Plant sexuality#Terminology|monoecious]] in flowering habit; flowers emerge in April to late May or early June. The staminate flowers are borne in catkins that develop from the leaf axils of the previous year, and the pistillate flowers develop from the axils of the current year's leaves. The fruit, an acorn or nut, is borne singly or in pairs, matures in 1 year, and ripens in September or October. About half of the acorn is enclosed in a thin cup and is chestnut brown to nearly black.<ref name=tammy />\n\nChinkapin oak is closely related to the smaller but generally similar [[Quercus prinoides|dwarf chinkapin oak (''Quercus prinoides'')]]. Chinkapin oak is usually a tree, but occasionally shrubby, while dwarf chinkapin oak is a low-growing, [[cloning|clone-forming]] shrub. The two species generally occur in different habitats: chinquapin oak is typically found on [[calcareous]] soils and rocky slopes, while dwarf chinkapin oak is usually found on [[soil pH|acidic substrates]], primarily sand or sandy soils, and also dry shales.<ref name=tammy /><ref Name=\"FNA Qprinoides\" />\n\nChinkapin oak is also sometimes confused with the related [[Quercus montana|chestnut oak (''Quercus montana'')]], which it closely resembles. However, unlike the pointed teeth on the leaves of the chinkapin oak, chestnut oak leaves generally have rounded teeth. The two species have contrasting kinds of bark: Chinkapin oak has a gray, flaky bark very similar to that of [[Quercus alba|white oak (''Q. alba'')]] but with a more yellow-brown cast to it (hence the occasional name yellow oak for this species), while chestnut oak has dark, solid, deeply ridged bark. The chinkapin oak also has smaller acorns than the chestnut oak or another similar species, the [[Quercus michauxii|swamp chestnut oak (''Q. michauxii'')]], which have some of the largest acorns of any oaks.<ref name=tammy />\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n=== Soil and topography ===\nChinkapin oak is generally found on well-drained upland soils derived from limestone or where limestone outcrops occur. Occasionally it is found on well-drained limestone soils along streams. The Chinkapin oak is generally found on soils that are weakly acid (pH about 6.5) to alkaline (above pH 7.0). It grows on both northerly and southerly aspects but is more common on the warmer southerly aspects. It is absent or rare at high elevations in the Appalachians.\n\n=== Associated cover ===\nIt is rarely a predominant tree, but it grows in association with many other species. It is a component of the forest cover type White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak (Society of American Foresters Type 52) and the Post Oak-Blackjack Oak (Type 40) (2).\n\nIt grows in association with white oak ''([[Quercus alba]]),'' black oak ([[Quercus velutina|Q. velutina]]), northern red oak ([[Quercus rubra|Q. rubra]]), scarlet oak ''([[Quercus coccinea|Q. coccinea]]),'' sugar maple ''([[Acer saccharum]]),'' red maple ([[Acer rubrum|A. rubrum]]), hickories (''[[Carya]]'' spp.), black cherry ''([[Prunus serotina]]),'' cucumbertree ''([[Magnolia acuminata]]),'' white ash ''([[Fraxinus americana]]),'' American basswood ''([[Tilia americana]]),'' black walnut ''([[Juglans nigra]]),'' butternut ''([[Juglans cinerea|J. cinerea]]),'' and yellow-poplar ''([[Liriodendron tulipifera]]).'' American beech ''([[Fagus grandifolia]]),'' shortleaf pine ''(''[[Pinus echinata]]''),'' pitch pine ''([[Pinus rigida|P. rigida]]),'' Virginia pine ''([[Pinus virginiana|P. virginiana]]),'' Ozark chinkapin ''([[Castanea ozarkensis]]),'' eastern redcedar ''([[Juniperus virginiana]]),'' bluejack oak ''([[Quercus incana]]),'' southern red oak ''([[Quercus falcata|Q. falcata]]),'' blackgum ''([[Nyssa sylvatica]]),'' and winged elm ''([[Ulmus alata]])'' also grow in association with chinkapin oak. In the Missouri Ozarks a redcedar-chinkapin oak association has been described.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe most common small tree and shrub species found in association with chinkapin oak include flowering dogwood ''(Cornus {{sic|hide=y|florida}}),'' sassafras ''([[Sassafras albidum]]),'' sourwood ''([[Oxydendron arboreum]]),'' eastern hophornbeam ''([[Ostrya virginiana]]),'' ''[[Vaccinium]]'' spp., ''[[Viburnum]]'' spp., hawthorns ''([[Crataegus]]'' spp.), and sumacs ''([[Rhus]]'' spp.). The most common woody vines are wild grape ''([[Vitis]]'' spp.) and greenbrier ''([[Smilax]]'' spp.).{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n=== Reaction to competition ===\nChinkapin oak is classed as intolerant of shade. It withstands moderate shading when young but becomes more intolerant of shade with age. It is regarded as a [[climax species]] on dry, drought prone soils, especially those of limestone origin. On more moist sites it is subclimax to climax. It is often found as a component of the climax vegetation in stands on mesic sites with limestone soils. However, many oak-hickory stands on moist sites that contain chinkapin oak are succeeded by a climax forest including beech, maple, and ash.\n\n== Diseases and pests ==\nSevere wildfire kills chinkapin oak saplings and small pole-size trees, but these often resprout. However, fire scars serve as entry points for decay-causing [[fungus|fungi]], and the resulting decay can cause serious losses.\n\n[[Oak wilt]] (Ceratocystis fagacearum), a vascular disease, attacks Chinkapin oak and usually kills the tree within two to four years. Other diseases that attack Chinkapin oak include the cankers ''Strumella coryneoidea'' and ''Nectria galligena'', shoestring root rot (''Armillarea mellea''), anthracnose (''Gnomonia veneta''), and leaf blister (''Taphrina'' spp.).{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe most serious defoliating [[insect]]s that attack Chinkapin oak are the [[gypsy moth]] (''Lymantria dispar''), the [[orangestriped oakworm]] (''Anisota senatoria''), and the variable oakleaf caterpillar (''Heterocampa manteo''). Insects that bore into the bole and seriously degrade the products cut from infested trees include the carpenterworm (''Prionoyxstus robiniae''), little carpenterworm (''P. macmurtrei''), white oak borer (''Goes tigrinus''), Columbian timber beetle (''Corthylus columbianus''), oak timberworm (''Arrhenodes minutus''), and twolined chestnut borer (''Agrilus bilineatus''). The acorn weevils (''Curculio'' spp.), larvae of moths (''Valentinia glandulella'' and ''Melissopus latiferreanus''), and gall forming cynipids (''Callirhytis'' spp.) feed on the acorns.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n== Uses ==\n{{expand section|date=October 2011}}\nLike that of other white oak species, the wood of the chinkapin oak (''Quercus muehlenbergii'') is a durable hardwood prized for many types of construction.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nThe chinquapin oak is especially known for its sweet and palatable acorns. Indeed, the nuts contained inside of the thin shell are among the sweetest of any oak, with an excellent taste even when eaten raw, providing an excellent source of food for both wildlife and people. The acorns are eaten by squirrels, mice, voles, chipmunks, deer, turkey, and other birds.<ref>[http://npsot.org/wp/boerne/publications/native-grown-articles/chinquapin-oak-a-nice-good-looking-shade-tree The Boerne Chapter of NPSOT (Native Plant Society of Texas), Chinquapin Oak \u2013 a NICE! good looking shade tree]/</ref><ref>{{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Quercus |species=muehlenbergii |first=Ivan L. |last=Sander}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233501065 Flora of North America: ''Quercus muhlenbergii''] [http://www.efloras.org/object_page.aspx?object_id=6842&flora_id=1 RangeMap:]\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/qumu.htm ''Quercus muehlenbergii'' images from Vanderbilt University]\n\n[[Category:Quercus|muehlenbergii]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of Northern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Plains-Midwest (United States)]]\n[[Category:Trees of humid continental climate]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1877]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by George Engelmann]]",

The American elm is an extremely hardy tree that can withstand winter temperatures as low as \u221242 \u00b0[[Celsius|C]] (\u221244 \u00b0[[Fahrenheit|F]]). Trees in areas unaffected by [[Dutch elm disease]] can live for several hundred years.

However, a study published in 2011 by the [[Agricultural Research Service]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] revealed that about 20% of wild American elms are [[diploid]], and may even constitute another species. Moreover, several triploid trees known only in cultivation, such as [[Ulmus americana 'Jefferson'|'Jefferson']], are possessed of a high degree of resistance to [[Dutch elm disease]] which ravaged American elms in the 20th century. This suggests that the diploid parent trees, which have markedly smaller cells than the tetraploid, may too be highly resistant to the disease.<ref name=Whittemore>Whittemore, A. & Olsen, R. (2011).

The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, 7&ndash;20&nbsp;cm long, with double-serrate margins and an oblique base. The [[perfect flower]]s are small, purple-brown and, being wind-pollinated, [[apetalous]]. The flowers are also [[protogynous]], the female parts maturing before the male, thus reducing, but not eliminating, self-fertilization,<ref name=\"Hans\">{{cite journal|last=Hans|first=A.

However, the condition is far less serious, and afflicted trees should recover the following year.\n\n===Dutch elm disease===\n{{Main article|Dutch elm disease}}\nDutch elm disease (DED) is a [[fungus|fungal]] [[disease]] which has ravaged the American elm, causing catastrophic die-offs in cities across the range. It has been estimated that only approximately 1 in 100,000 American elm trees is DED-tolerant, most known survivors simply having escaped exposure to the disease.<ref name=\"DEDresistance\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jul96/elms0796.htm|title=New American Elms Restore Stately Trees|publisher=Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture|date=July 1996|accessdate=December 18, 2014}}</ref> However, in some areas still not populated by Dutch elm disease, the American elm continues to thrive, notably in [[Florida]], [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]].\n\nThe American elm is particularly susceptible to disease because the period of infection often coincides with the period, approximately 30 days, of rapid terminal growth when new springwood vessels are fully functional. Spores introduced outside of this period remain largely static within the [[xylem]] and are thus relatively ineffective.<ref name=Smalley>{{cite journal|last=Smalley|first=E. G.|year=1963|title=Seasonal Fluctuations in Susceptibility of Young Elm Seedlings to Dutch Elm Disease|journal=Phytopathology|volume=53|issue=7|pages= 846\u2013853}}</ref>\n\nThe American elm's biology in some ways has helped to spare it from obliteration by the Dutch elm disease, in contrast to what happened to the [[American chestnut]] with the [[chestnut blight]]. The elm's seeds are largely wind-dispersed, and the tree grows quickly and begins bearing seeds at a young age. It grows well along roads or railroad tracks, and in abandoned lots and other disturbed areas, where it is highly tolerant of most stress factors. Elms have been able to survive and to reproduce in areas where the disease had eliminated old trees, although most of these young elms eventually succumb to the disease at a relatively young age. There is some reason to hope that these elms will preserve the genetic diversity of the original population, and that they eventually will hybridize with DED-resistant varieties that have been developed or that occur naturally. After 20 years of research, American scientists first developed DED-resistant strains of elms in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"DEDresistance\" />\n\nFungicidal injections can be administered to valuable American elms, to prevent infection. Such injections generally are effective as a preventive measure for up to three years when performed before any symptoms have appeared, but may be ineffective once the disease is evident.\n\n==Cultivation==\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, American elm was a common street and park tree owing to its tolerance of urban conditions, rapid growth, and graceful form. This however led to extreme overplanting of the species, especially to form living archways over streets, which ultimately produced an unhealthy [[monoculture]] of elms that had no resistance to disease and pests.<ref name=\"Stennes\">{{cite journal| last=Stennes | first=Mark | year=2003 | title=Good News for the American Elm | journal=Shade Tree Advocate | volume=5 | issue=4 | page=6 |accessdate=December 19, 2014}}</ref> These trees' rapid growth and longevity, leading to great size within decades, also favored its horticultural use before the advent of Dutch elm disease.<ref Name=Werthner/> Ohio botanist William B. Werthner, discussing the contrast between open-grown and forest-grown American elms, noted that:  \n<blockquote>\nIn the open, with an abundance of air and light, the main trunk divides into several leading branches which leave the trunk at a sharp angle and continue to grow upward, gradually diverging, dividing and subdividing into long, flexible branchlets whose ends, at last, float lightly in the air, giving the tree a round, somewhat flattened top of beautifully regular proportions and characteristically fine twiggery.<ref name=Werthner />\n</blockquote>\n\nIt is this distinctive growth form that is so valued in the open-grown American elms of street plantings, lawns, and parks; along most narrower streets, elms planted on opposite sides arch and blend together into a leafy canopy over the pavement. However, elms can assume many different sizes and forms depending on the location and climate zone, and the classic vase-like shape is far from the norm in naturally occurring (as opposed to cultivated) specimens.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"px\" heights=\"px\">\nFile:NIE 1905 Elm.jpg|Early photos of New England American elms, showing growth patterns, ''The New International Encyclop\u00e6dia'' (1905).\nFile:Lafayette Street, Salem, MA.jpg|Lafayette Street, Salem, MA.: 'high-tunnel effect' of ''U. americana'' avenues once common in New England.\nFile:American Elm, Western Massachusetts - September 2016.jpg|Surviving American elm \"street tree\" in western Massachusetts (2016).\nFile:PSM V78 D424 An old cambridge landmark.png|''Ulmus americana'' as campus elm: Cambridge, Massachusetts\nFile:Massachusetts American Elm 1 - May 2012.jpg|American elm, Massachusetts (2012).
