''floridanum'']</ref><ref name=usfs>{{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Acer |species=barbatum |first=Earle R |last=Jones, Jr.}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\nIt is a medium-sized to large [[deciduous]] [[tree]], growing to 15\u201325 m (exceptionally to 38 m) tall, with an elliptical crown of moderate density with a smooth or rounded outline. The [[bark]] is a light gray with thick irregular curling ridges; as the tree matures, the bark tends to become plated. The [[twig]]s are slender, somewhat shiny, reddish brown. The terminal [[bud]]s are sharply pointed, brown and pubescent. The [[leaf|leaves]] are opposite, simple, palmately lobed and veined, 3\u20139.5&nbsp;cm long and 3.5\u201311&nbsp;cm broad, with an entire margin and three or five somewhat rounded lobes, and a 2\u20138&nbsp;cm long [[petiole (botany)|petiole]]. They are green above and paler and pubescent below. In fall they turn orange and yellow. The [[flower]]s are regular, pentamerous, and appear on yellow-green [[corymb]]s and are quite small. They hang from puberulent [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]]s 2.4\u20135&nbsp;cm long in clusters of a few flowers, appearing before or with the leaves in early spring. This is about two weeks prior to the maturation of the flowers of ''[[Acer saccharum]]''. The tree is generally [[diecious]], though they are often also polygamous, that is having bisexual and unisexual flowers on the same individual. The [[fruit]] is a paired [[samara (fruit)|samara]] 1.5\u20133&nbsp;cm long.<ref name=usfs/><ref name=seiberling>Common Trees of the North Carolina Piedmont: [http://www.ibiblio.org/openkey/intkey/web/ACBA3.htm ''Acer barbatum'']</ref>\n\n''Acer floridanum'' can easily be confused in the field with the closely related ''[[Acer leucoderme]]'' and ''[[Acer saccharum]]''. It can be best distinguished from ''A. saccharum'' by noting the smaller leaves with short and acute lobes, the smaller samaras, and the more whitish bark. Several overlaps in genetics between these two species have been found in east Texas and in the zone from [[Maryland]] south to northern Florida, despite the fact that Maryland is listed as beyond the natural range of the tree. In light of this information, it can be assumed that the two [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridize]].<ref name=usfs/> From ''A. leucoderme'', it is best told by the white hairs on the undersides of the leaves, yellow-haired in ''A. leucoderme''.<ref name=duke>Carolina Nature: [http://www.carolinanature.com/trees/acfl.html ''Southern Sugar Maple (Acer floridanum)'']</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nDebate still exists about its taxonomic status, which has been controversial for at least 100 years.<ref name=castanea/>\n\nThe Florida Maple was first recognised as distinct in 1860 by [[Alvan Wentworth Chapman]], who treated it as a variety of ''A. saccharum''. In 1886 [[Ferdinand Albin Pax]] decided it was distinct enough to be treated as a separate species, making the new combination ''A. floridanum'' (Chapm.) Pax.<ref name=castanea/> In 1952, Yves Desmarais took an intermediate option, treating it as a subspecies ''Acer saccharum'' subsp. ''floridanum'' (Chapm.) Desmarais, a treatment which has fairly wide recent recognition.<ref name=grin/><ref>Desmarais, Y. (1952). Dynamics of Leaf Variation in the Sugar Maples. ''Brittonia'' 7 (5): 347-387. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2804966 Abstract]</ref><ref name=\"gelderen\">van Gelderen, C. J. & van Gelderen, D. M. (1999). ''Maples for Gardens: A Color Encyclopedia''.</ref>\n\nA further problem exists with the specific name ''Acer barbatum'', given to a maple by [[Andr\u00e9 Michaux]] in 1803 from samples collected in the [[Carolinas]] during his decade in North America from 1785 to 1796. For a long time it was unclear if the plant he collected was ''[[Acer saccharum]]'' (Sugar Maple) or ''A. floridanum'', as his samples were badly damaged on his return to [[Paris]]. [[M. L. Fernald]] reexamined the species in the mid-1940s for the 8th edition of Gray's Manual, published in 1950; on reviewing Michaux's notes on ''A. barbatum'', he decided to apply this name to the Florida Maple in 1945, based on his interpretation that Michaux's samples, which he only knew through notes (Michaux's collections were in Paris, inaccessible as [[World War II]] had not yet ended), corresponded more closely to Florida Maple than to Sugar Maple. Since the oldest given name takes precedence, he used the name ''A. barbatum'' for the Florida Maple. Many subsequent authors accepted this judgement, such as the [[United States Forest Service]],<ref name=usfs/><ref name=usda>USDA Plants Profile: [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ACBA3 ''Acer barbatum'']</ref> and Wilbur H. Duncan and Marion Duncan's ''Trees of the Southeastern United States'', published in 1988. However, recent examination by D. B. Ward has shown that they are typical ''Acer saccharum'' after all, and not ''A. floridanum'' as Fernald had thought without examination, and thus Michaux's name is correctly a synonym of ''A. saccharum''.<ref name=castanea/><ref name=grin/>\n\n==Distribution and ecology==\nThe distribution is discontinuous in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] and [[Atlantic Coastal Plain]] from southeastern [[Virginia]] southwest across [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], as well as into the [[Florida]] Panhandle. The range goes farther west across [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], [[Louisiana]], into eastern [[Texas]], and north through [[Arkansas]] and into eastern [[Oklahoma]]. The species also occurs in several isolated locations roughly halfway down the [[Gulf Coast]] of the Florida peninsula, and also in at least one location in central Oklahoma. The species is also found in isolated locations of [[Illinois]], [[Montana]], [[Tennessee]] and Kentucky.<ref name=usfs/><ref name=usda/>\n\nThe average annual rainfall within the native area ranges from {{convert|112|to|163|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}. The driest months average no less than {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The normal temperatures in January within the range vary from {{convert|11|to|18|C|F}} maximum, and from {{convert|-2|to|7|C|F}} minimum, whereas in July normal maxima are {{convert|29|to|33|C|F}}, and minima are {{convert|21|to|24|C|F}}. The tree favours moist, but well-drained fertile soils, especially on stream terrace, in coves, and on adjacent bluffs and ridgetops. It grows best on soils containing [[calcareous]] material such as [[limestone]] or [[marl]]. It also grows well on the densely forested [[hammock (ecology)|hammocks]] of Florida, hence its alternative common name hammock maple. It is most often confined to the understory.<ref name=usfs/>\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\nWhile not an overwhelmingly popular tree in cultivation, it is sometimes employed in the [[Southern United States]] as a shade tree due to its round crown and its greater resistance to heat than that of its more showy relative the sugar maple. Several species of birds and especially squirrels make use of the tree as a nesting site and also consume its seeds as a food source.<ref name=usfs/>\n\nDespite the fact that of itself Florida Maple is not employed as a commercial timber species, it is used with associated commercial species when the products are [[pulpwood]], sawtimber, or [[wood veneer]] stock. It is considered a hard maple and as high quality individuals are suitable for producing furniture, flooring, paneling, and [[shoe last]]s. However, its relative scarcity, small size, and fairly poor shape generally confine its use to only factory and box lumber, and even this is only an occasional occurrence. It has, however, been experiencing growing popularity as an ornamental or shade tree, especially in the [[southern United States]] due to its high heat resistance. It is also a source of [[maple syrup]], though again its size and rarity limit its use in this regard, especially in light of the Sugar Maple's established popularity within the business.<ref name=usfs/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Acer|floridanum]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]",

It lives in the [[understory]] in moist, rocky soils on river banks, ravines, woods, and cliffs.  Although generally a rare tree, it is common in the inner [[coastal plain]] and [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] regions of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].\n\nIt is a small tree, reaching 8\u20139 m in height and developing a round form with slender branches, and often with multiple trunks.  The name \"chalk maple\" (in addition to the Latin name, meaning \"white skin\") comes from the attractive smooth and thin chalky white or light gray [[bark]] on mature trees.  The bark becomes ridged and blackish at the base as it ages.  The [[leaf|leaves]] are opposite and simple, 5\u20139&nbsp;cm long and broad, often drooping at the tip.  They have 5 or 3 long-pointed lobes with wavy or coarsely toothed edges.  They are dark green and hairless above, with a yellow-green and softly pubescent underside.  In autumn, the leaves turn from a brilliant yellow to orange to deep red.  The [[fruit]] is a paired brown [[samara (fruit)|samara]], 2-2.5&nbsp;cm long, maturing in autumn.\n\n''Acer leucoderme'' is often confused with ''[[Acer floridanum]]'' (Florida maple), but there are several differences.  ''A. leucoderme'' is smaller in size but has larger leaves than Florida maple.  The leaves of ''A. leucoderme'' are yellow-green underneath rather than the whitish underside of Florida maple.  The lobes on the leaves of Florida maple are squarer and blunter than those of ''A. leucoderme''.\n\n''Acer leucoderme'' can be grown as a shade tree or [[reclamation plant]] up through [[USDA plant hardiness zone]] 5B, far north of its natural range.  The tree is highly shade- and drought-tolerant.\n\nSome botanists classify ''A. leucoderme'' as a [[subspecies]] of the sugar maple: ''[[Acer saccharum|A. saccharum]]'' subsp. ''leucoderme''.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n* Little, Elbert L.  ''National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Trees: Eastern Region''.  New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1980.

In [[Canada]] it is commonly known as [[Manitoba]] maple and occasionally as elf maple. '''Box elder''', '''boxelder maple''', '''ash-leaved maple''', and '''maple ash''' are its most common names in the [[United States]]; in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] it is also known as '''ashleaf maple'''.<ref name=BSBI07>{{cite web|title=BSBI List 2007 |publisher=Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland |url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |format=xls |access-date=2014-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VqJ46atN?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bsbi.org.uk%2FBSBIList2007.xls |archivedate=2015-01-25 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Common names ==\n\nIndicative of its familiarity to many people over a large geographic range, ''A. negundo'' has numerous common names.\n\nThe names \"box elder\" and \"boxelder maple\" are based upon the similarity of its whitish wood to that of [[Buxus|boxwood]] and the similarity of its [[pinnate]]ly compound leaves to those of some species of [[Sambucus|elder]].<ref>[http://www.depauw.edu/univ/naturepark/natural_history/trees/aceraceae/acer_negundo.htm DePauw University]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>   This is the only North American maple with compound leaves, though several Asian species also have them.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book | last=Keeler | first=H. L. | title=Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them | publisher=Charles Scriber's Sons | year=1900 | location=New York | pages=85\u201387 }}</ref>\n\nOther common names are based upon this maple's similarity to [[Fraxinus|ash]], its preferred environment, its [[maple syrup|sugary sap]], a description of its leaves, its [[binomial name]], and so on.  These names include (but are not limited to) ash-, cut-, or three-leaf (or -leaved) maple; ash maple; sugar ash; Negundo maple; and river maple.<ref>[http://www.windsorplywood.com/ Acer spp. Aceraceae] Note that some of the common names given in this reference are questionable.  \"stinking ash\" and \"black ash\" typically refer to ''[[Ptelea trifoliata]]'' and ''[[Fraxinus nigra]]'', respectively.  This reference is retained as an example of the confusion which arises when plants such as ''A. negundo'' are discussed by other than their [[scientific name]]s.</ref>  In [[Canada]] it is commonly known as Manitoba maple and occasionally as elf maple.<ref>[http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/index/commtreesprairies/manitobamaple Community trees of the Prairie provinces&nbsp;\u2013 Canadian Forest Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  In [[Russia]] it is called American maple ({{lang-rus|\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0451\u043d|amerikansky klyon}})<!-- [[Wikipedia:Romanization of Russian]] --> as well as ash-leaf maple ({{lang-rus|\u043a\u043b\u0451\u043d \u044f\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0301\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439|klyon yasenelistny}}), and in Italian ''acero americano''.<ref>[http://luirig.altervista.org/flora/taxa/index2.php?scientific-name=acer+negundo Altervista Italiana, Acero americano, ''Acer negundo'' L.]</ref>\n\nCommon names may also designate a particular [[subspecies]].  For example, a common name for ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''interius'' may be preceded by \"inland\" (as in \"inland boxelder maple\").  A common name for ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''californicum'' may be preceded by \"California\" or \"western\".\n\n[[File:2014-10-11 12 48 07 Box Elder Maple foliage during autumn in Elko, Nevada.JPG|thumb|left|Autumn leaf color]]\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Acer negundo bark-Clapiers~2010 04 05.jpg|thumb|left|Bark of a young ''Acer negundo''.]]\n''Acer negundo'' is a usually fast-growing and fairly short-lived [[tree]] that grows up to {{convert|10|-|25|m|ft|round=5|sp=us}} tall, with a trunk diameter of {{convert|30|-|50|cm|in|0|sp=us}}, rarely up to {{convert|1|m|ft|sp=us}} diameter.  It often has several trunks and can form impenetrable thickets.<ref name=\"gelderen\">van Gelderen, C.J. & van Gelderen, D.M. (1999). ''Maples for Gardens: A Color Encyclopedia''.</ref>\n\nThe shoots are green, often with a whitish to pink or violet [[wax]]y coating when young.  Branches are smooth, somewhat brittle, and tend to retain a fresh green colour rather than forming a [[bark]] of dead, protective tissue.  The bark on its trunks is pale gray or light brown, deeply cleft into broad ridges, and scaly.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nUnlike most other maples (which usually have [[simple leaf|simple]], [[palmate]]ly [[lobed leaf|lobed]] [[leaf|leaves]]), ''Acer negundo'' has [[pinnate]]ly [[compound leaf|compound]] leaves that usually have three to seven leaflets.  Simple leaves are also occasionally present;  technically, these are single-leaflet compound leaves.  Although some other maples (such as ''[[Acer griseum]]'', ''[[Acer mandshuricum]]'' and the closely related [[Acer cissifolium|''A. cissifolium'']]) have [[leaf shape|trifoliate]] leaves, only ''A. negundo'' regularly displays more than three leaflets.\n\nThe leaflets are about {{convert|5|-|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}} long and {{convert|3|-|7|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} wide with slightly serrate margins.  Leaves have a [[translucence|translucent]] light green color and turn yellow in the [[Autumn|fall]].\n\nThe [[flower]]s are small and appear in early spring on drooping [[raceme]]s {{convert|10|-|20|cm|in|0|sp=us}} long.  The [[fruit]]s are paired [[Samara (fruit)|samaras]], each seed slender, {{convert|1|-|2|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long, with a {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} incurved wing; they drop in autumn or they may persist through winter.  Seeds are usually both prolific and [[fertility|fertile]].\n\nUnlike most other maples, ''A. negundo'' is fully [[dioecious]] and both a male and female tree are needed for either to reproduce.\n\n* Winter buds: Terminal buds acute, an eighth of an inch long.  Lateral buds obtuse.  The inner scales enlarge when spring growth begins and often become an inch long before they fall.\n* Flowers: April, before the leaves, yellow green; staminate flowers in clusters on slender hairy pedicels one and a half to two inches long.  Pistillate flowers in narrow drooping racemes.\n* Calyx: Yellow green; staminate flowers campanulate, five-lobed, hairy.  Pistillate flowers smaller, five-parted; disk rudimentary.\n* Corolla: Wanting.\n* Stamens: Four to six, exserted; filaments slender, hairy; anthers linear, connective pointed.\n* Pistil: Ovary hairy, borne on disk, partly enclosed by calyx, two-celled, wing-margined.  Styles separate at base into two stigmatic lobes.\n* Fruit: Maple keys, full size in early summer.  Borne in drooping racemes, pedicels one to two inches long.  Key an inch and a half to two inches long, nutlets diverging, wings straight or incurved.  September.  Seed half an inch long.  Cotyledons, thin, narrow.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\n=== Subspecies ===\n[[File:Acer negundo.jpg|thumb|right|''A. negundo'' leaves and fruits]]\n\n''Acer negundo'' is often discussed as comprising three subspecies, each of which was originally described as a separate species.  These are:\n\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''negundo'' is the main variety and the type to which characteristics described in the article most universally apply.  Its natural range is from the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] to the Rocky Mountains.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''interius'' has more leaf serration than the main species and a more [[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]] leaf surface.  As the name ''interus'' indicates, its natural range of [[Saskatchewan]] to [[New Mexico]] is sandwiched between that of the other two subspecies.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''californicum'' has larger leaves than the main species.  Leaves also have a velvety texture which is essential to distinguish it from ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''negundo''.  It is found in parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]].<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n\nSome authors further subdivide subsp. ''negundo'' into a number of regional varieties but these intergrade and their maintenance as distinct [[taxa]] is disputed by many.  Even the differences between recognized subspecies are probably a matter of gradient [[speciation]].\n\nFinally, note that a few botanists treat boxelder maple as its own distinct genus (''Negundo aceroides'') but this is not widely accepted.\n\n== Distribution ==\nAs noted, varieties thrive across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It may also be found as far south as [[Guatemala]].\n\nAlthough native to [[North America]], it is considered an [[invasive species]] in some areas of that continent. It can quickly [[colonize]] both cultivated and uncultivated areas and the range is therefore expanding both in North America and elsewhere. In Europe where it was introduced in 1688 as a park tree it is able to spread quickly in places and is considered an invasive species in parts of Central Europe (Germany and the Czech Republic, middle Danube, Vistula river valley in Poland) where it can form mass growth in lowlands, disturbed areas and riparian biomes on calcareous soils. It has also become [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] in eastern [[China]]<ref name=\"gelderen\" />  and can be found in some of the cooler areas of the [[Australian continent]] where it is listed as a pest [[invasive species]].\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Acer negundo tree.jpg|thumb|Boxelder, Manitoba Maple. Tree. ND, USA.]]\n\nThis species prefers bright sunlight. It often grows on flood plains and other disturbed areas with ample water supply, such as [[riparian]] habitats. Human influence has greatly favoured this species; it grows around houses and in hedges, as well as on disturbed ground and vacant lots.\n\nSeveral [[bird]]s and some [[squirrel]]s feed on the seeds.  The [[evening grosbeak]] uses them extensively. The [[Maple Bug]] (also known as the Boxelder Bug) lays its [[egg]]s on all maples, but prefers this species.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nAlthough its weak wood, irregular form, and prolific seeding might make it seem like a poor choice for a landscape tree, ''A. negundo'' is one of the most common maples in cultivation and many interesting [[cultivar]]s have been developed, including:<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* 'Auratum'&nbsp;\u2013 yellowish leaves with smooth undersides\n* 'Aureomarginatum'&nbsp;\u2013 creamy yellow leaf margins\n* 'Baron'&nbsp;\u2013 Hardier & seedless variety\n* 'Elegans'&nbsp;\u2013 distinctively convex leaves\n* 'Flamingo'&nbsp;\u2013 pink and white [[variegation]] (very popular)\n* [[Acer negundo 'Pendulum'|'Pendulum']]&nbsp;\u2013 with weeping branches.\n* 'Variegatum'&nbsp;\u2013 creamy white leaf margins\n* 'Violaceum'&nbsp;\u2013 younger shoots and branches have bluish colour\n\n== Uses ==\nAlthough its light, close-grained, soft wood is considered undesirable for most uses, this tree has been considered as a commercial source of wood fiber, for use in [[fiberboard]].\n\nThere is some commercial use of the tree for various decorative applications, such as turned items (bowls, stem-ware, pens). Primarily burl wood and injured wood, where the primary reason is this wood's reaction to injury, where the injured wood develops a red stain.\n\n=== Use by Native Americans ===\nThe [[Navajo people|Navajo]] use the wood to make tubes for bellows.<ref>Elmore, Francis H. 1944 Ethnobotany of the Navajo.

Many of its features, especially its leaves, are quite variable in form. At maturity it often attains a height of around {{convert|15|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}. Its flowers, petioles, twigs and seeds are all red to varying degrees. Among these features, however, it is best known for its brilliant deep scarlet foliage in autumn.\n\nOver most of its range, red maple is adaptable to a very wide range of site conditions, perhaps more so than any other tree in eastern North America. It can be found growing in [[swamp]]s, on poor dry [[soil]]s, and most anywhere in between. It grows well from [[sea level]] to about {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Due to its attractive fall foliage and pleasing form, it is often used as a shade tree for landscapes. It is used commercially on a small scale for [[maple syrup]] production as well as for its medium to high quality lumber. It is also the [[List of U.S. state trees|State Tree of Rhode Island]].

In contrast, the leaves of the related [[silver maple]], ''A. saccharinum'', are much more deeply lobed, more sharply toothed and characteristically have 5 lobes. The upper side of ''A. rubrum'''s leaf is light green and the underside is whitish and can be either [[glaucous]] or hairy. The leaf stalks are usually red and are up to {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long. Furthermore, the leaves can turn a brilliant red in autumn, but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals.\n\n[[File:2013-05-10 13 40 17 Immature foliage of Red Maple in Brendan T Byrne State Forest, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Immature foliage of Acer rubrum (Red Maple)]]\nThe [[twig]]s of the red maple are reddish in color and somewhat shiny with small [[lenticel]]s. Dwarf shoots are present on many branches. The [[bud]]s are usually blunt and greenish to reddish in color, generally with several loose scales. The lateral buds are slightly stalked, and in addition there may be collateral buds present as well. The buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their reddish tint.

It can be found from the south of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Nova Scotia]] and southern [[Quebec]] to the south west of Ontario, extreme southeastern [[Manitoba]] and northern [[Minnesota]]; south to [[Wisconsin]], [[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], eastern [[Oklahoma]], and eastern [[Texas]] in its western range; and east to [[Florida]]. It has the largest continuous range along the North American [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] of any tree that occurs in Florida. In total it ranges {{convert|2600|km|mi|abbr=on}} from north to south.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> The species is native to all regions of the United States east of the [[95th meridian west|95th meridian]]. The tree's range ends where the {{convert|-40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} mean minimum [[isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]] begins, namely in southeastern [[Canada]]. ''A. rubrum'' is not present in the Prairie Peninsula of the northern [[Midwest]], the [[Western Gulf coastal grasslands|coastal prairie]] in southern [[Louisiana]] and southeastern Texas and the swamp prairie of the [[Florida Everglades]].<ref name=\"USDF\" /> The absence of red maple in the Prairie Peninsula is perhaps due to the specie's intolerance of fire.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/Volume_2/acer/rubrum.htm|title=Acer rubrum L.|last=Walters|first=Russell S|last2=Yawney|first2=Harry W.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn several other locations, the tree is absent from large areas but still present in a few specific habitats. An example is the [[Bluegrass region]] of Kentucky, where red maple is not found in the dominant open plains, but is present along streams.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Campbell| first=J| title=The Land of Cane and Clover| page=25| publisher=University of Kentucky| year=1985| postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the [[Grain Belt]], despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Linnaeus Acer rubrum.jpg|thumb|right|The type specimen of ''A. rubrum'' used by [[Carl Linnaeus]] when naming the species]] -->''A. rubrum'' does very well in a wide range of soil types, with varying textures, moisture, [[pH]], and elevation, probably more so than any other forest tree in North America.

Moist mineral soil is best for germination of seeds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe red maple can grow in a variety of moist and dry biomes, from dry ridges and sunny, southwest-facing slopes to [[peat bog]]s and [[swamp]]s. While many types of tree prefer a south or north facing aspect, the red maple does not appear to have a preference.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> Its ideal conditions are in moderately well-drained, moist sites at low or intermediate elevations. However, it is nonetheless common in mountainous areas on relatively dry ridges, as well as on both the south and west sides of upper slopes. Furthermore, it is common in swampy areas, along the banks of slow moving streams, as well as on poorly drained flats and depressions. In northern [[Michigan]] and [[New England]], the tree is found on the tops of ridges, sandy or rocky upland and otherwise dry soils, as well as in nearly pure stands on moist soils and the edges of swamps. In the far south of its range, it is almost exclusively associated with swamps.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> Additionally, Red maple is one of the most drought-tolerant species of maple in the Carolinas.<ref name=\"Miller\">Miller, J.H., & Miller, K.V. (1999). ''Forest plants of the southeast and their wildlife uses''. Champaign, IL: Kings Time Printing.</ref>\n\nRed maple is far more abundant today than when Europeans first arrived in North America, where along with its cousin Silver Maple, it may have comprised a mere 5% of forest area and was confined mostly to [[riparian zone]]s.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> The density of the tree in many of these areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing, much of it due to human factors, especially suppression of wildfires which would kill shallow-rooted pioneer species like red maple, but leave mainline forest trees like oaks and hickories untouched.\n\nAdditionally, conservation efforts of the red maple have caused a major increase in the population of [[white-tailed deer]] since the mid-20th century. Deer will readily consume acorns, but leave maple seeds untouched, thus reducing the ability of oaks to regenerate compared to maples.<ref name=\"Perdue\" />  Because it can grow on a variety of substrates, has a high pH tolerance, and grows in both shade and sun, ''A. rubrum'' can be called a \"super-generalist,\" and it is predicted to replace historically dominant tree species in the eastern United States such as  [[oak]]s, [[hickory]]s and [[pine]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abrams|first=M.D.|year=1998|title=The Red Maple Paradox: what explains the widespread expansion of red maple in eastern forests?|url=|journal=BioScience|volume=48 |issue=5|pages=355\u2013364|via=}}</ref> Extensive use of red maple in landscaping has also contributed to the surge in the species' numbers as volunteer seedlings proliferate.

Its ability to thrive in a large number of habitats is largely due to its ability to produce [[root]]s to suit its site from a young age. In wet locations, red maple seedlings produce short [[taproot]]s with long and developed lateral roots, while on dry sites, they develop long taproots with significantly shorter laterals. The roots are primarily horizontal, however, forming in the upper {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} of the ground. Mature trees have woody roots up to {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. They are very tolerant of flooding, with one study showing that 60 days of flooding caused no leaf damage. At the same time, they are tolerant of drought due to their ability to stop growing under dry conditions by then producing a second growth flush when conditions later improve, even if growth has stopped for 2 weeks.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\n[[File:Maplekeys.jpg|left|thumb|Samaras from a specimen in [[Milford, New Hampshire]]]]\n''A. rubrum'' is one of the first plants to flower in spring. A crop of seeds is generally produced every year with a bumper crop often occurring every second year. A single tree between {{convert|5|and|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter can produce between 12,000 and 91,000 seeds in a season. A tree {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter was shown to produce nearly a million seeds.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> Red maple produces one of the smallest seeds of any of the maples.<ref name=\"Miller\" />  Fertilization has also been shown to significantly increase the seed yield for up to two years after application. The seeds are [[epigeal germination|epigeal]] and tend to germinate in early summer soon after they are released, assuming a small amount of light, moisture, and sufficient temperatures are present. If the seeds are densely shaded, then germination commonly does not occur until the next spring. Most seedlings do not survive in closed [[canopy (biology)|forest canopy]] situations. However, one- to four-year-old seedlings are common under dense canopy and though they eventually die if no light reaches them, they serve as a reservoir, waiting to fill any open area of the canopy above. Trees growing in a Zone 9 or 10 area such as Florida will usually die from cold damage if transferred up north, Canada, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, even if the southern trees were planted with northern red maples. Due to their wide range, genetically the trees have adapted to the climatic differences.\n\n[[File:2015-04-13 10 38 10 Female Red Maple flowers on Madison Avenue in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Female flowers]]\nRed maple is able to increase its numbers significantly when associate trees are damaged by disease, cutting, or fire. One study found that 6 years after [[clearcutting]] a {{convert|3.4|ha|acre|abbr=off}} Oak-Hickory forest containing no red maples, the plot contained more than 2,200 red maple seedlings per hectare (900 per acre) taller than {{convert|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> One of its associates, the [[black cherry]] (''[[Prunus serotina]]''), contains benzoic acid, which has been shown to be a potential [[allelopathic]] inhibitor of red maple growth. Red maple is one of the first species to start stem elongation. In one study, stem elongation was one-half completed in 1 week, after which growth slowed and was 90% completed within only 54 days. In good light and moisture conditions, the seedlings can grow {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in their first year and up to {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} each year for the next few years making it a fast grower.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\nThe red maple is a used as a food source by several forms of wildlife. [[Elk]] and [[white-tailed deer]] in particular use the current season's growth of red maple as an important source of winter food. Several [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies and moths) utilize the leaves as food; see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on maples]].\n\n[[File:2015-04-12 16 31 55 Male Red Maple flowers on Bayberry Road in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|left|thumb|Male flowers]]\nDue to ''A. rubrum'''s very wide range, there is significant variation in hardiness, size, form, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, have the most reddish fall color, set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. In Florida, at the extreme south of the red maple's range, it is limited exclusively to swamplands. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief, frost-free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As a result of the variation there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation. This is especially useful for making urban [[cultivar]]s that require resistance from [[verticillium wilt]], air pollution, and drought.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\n[[File:Autumn Blaze Maple in Toronto.jpg|right|thumb|160px|''Acer \u00d7 freemanii'' 'Jeffersred' in Toronto]]\nRed maple frequently hybridizes with [[Silver Maple]]; the [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]], known as Freeman's Maple ''Acer x freemanii'', is intermediate between the parents.\n\n=== Allergenic potential ===\nThe allergenic potential of red maples varies widely based on the cultivar.\n\nThe following cultivars are completely [[male]] and are highly allergenic, with an [[OPALS (Ogren Plant Allergy Scale)|OPALS]] allergy scale rating of 8 or higher:<ref name=Ogren>{{cite book|last1=Ogren|first1=Thomas|title=The Allergy-Fighting Garden|date=2015|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=978-1-60774-491-7|pages=54\u201355}}</ref>\n\n* 'Autumn Flame' ('Flame')\n* 'Autumn Spire'\n* 'Columnare' ('Pyramidale')\n* 'Firedance' ('Landsburg')\n* 'Karpick'\n* 'Northwood'\n* 'October Brilliance'\n* 'Sun Valley'\n* 'Tiliford'\n\nThe following cultivars have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 3 or lower; they are completely [[female]] trees, and have low potential for causing allergies:<ref name=\"Ogren\" />\n\n* 'Autumn Glory'\n* 'Bowhall'\n* 'Davey Red'\n* 'Doric'\n* 'Embers'\n* 'Festival'\n* 'October Glory'\n* 'Red Skin'\n* 'Red Sunset' ('Franksred')\n\n=== Toxicity ===\nThe leaves of red maple, especially when dead or wilted, are extremely [[List of plants poisonous to equines|toxic to horses]]. The toxin is unknown, but believed to be an [[oxidant]] because it damages [[red blood cell]]s, causing acute [[hemolysis|oxidative hemolysis]] that inhibits the transport of [[oxygen]]. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads to the production of [[methemoglobin]], which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700&nbsp;grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, [[jaundice]], dark brown urine, [[horse colic|colic]], [[laminitis]], coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of [[methylene blue]] or mineral oil and [[activated carbon]] in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as [[blood transfusion]]s, fluid support, [[diuretic]]s, and anti-oxidants such as [[Vitamin C]]. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.<ref name=\"Perdue\">{{cite web | last =Goetz | first =R.

In parts of the [[Pacific Northwest]], it is one of the most common introduced trees. Its popularity in cultivation stems from its vigorous habit, its attractive and early red flowers, and most importantly, its flaming red fall foliage. The tree was introduced into the [[United Kingdom]] in 1656 and shortly thereafter entered cultivation. There it is frequently found in many parks and gardens, as well as occasionally in churchyards.<ref name=\"Mitchell\">{{cite book | last =Mitchell | first =A.

The wood is close grained and as such it is similar to that of ''A. saccharum'', but its texture is softer, less dense, and has a poorer figure and machining qualities. High grades of wood from the red maple can nonetheless be substituted for hard maple, particularly when it comes to making [[furniture]]. As a soft maple, the wood tends to shrink more during the drying process than with the hard maples.\n\nRed maple is also used for the production of [[maple syrup]], though the hard maples ''[[Acer saccharum]]'' (sugar maple) and ''[[Acer nigrum]]'' (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple, as well as those of the ''[[Acer saccharinum]]'' (silver maple), ''[[Acer negundo]]'' (boxelder), and ''[[Acer platanoides]]'' (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\nRed maple is a medium quality firewood,<ref>{{cite web|title=Heating With Wood: Species Characteristics and Volumes|author=Michael Kuhns and Tom Schmidt|date=n.d.|publisher=UtahState University Cooperative Extension|url=http://extension.usu.edu/forestry/HomeTown/General_HeatingWithWood.htm}}</ref> possessing less heat energy, nominally 5.4 MJ/m\u00b3 (18.7 million BTU (mbtu) per cord), than other hardwoods such as Ash: 7 MJ/m\u00b3 (24 mbtu/cord), Oak: 7 MJ/m\u00b3 (24 mbtu/cord), or Birch: 5.8 MJ/m\u00b3 (20 mbtu/cord).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of plants poisonous to equines]]\n* [[List of foods made from maple]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikispecies}}\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ACRU NRCS: United States Department of Agriculture Plants Profile and map: ''Acer rubrum'']\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/acru.htm ''Acer rubrum'' images from Vanderbilt University]\n*[http://www.portraitoftheearth.com/trees/redsilvermaple.html Portrait of the Earth, Winter ID photos]\n{{Commons category|position=left|Acer rubrum}}\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Acer|rubrum]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Flora of Southeastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Symbols of Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Plants used in bonsai]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

It is one of the most common trees in the [[United States]].\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Silver maple leaf.jpg|thumb|left|A silver maple leaf]]\nThe silver maple tree is a relatively fast-growing [[deciduous]] [[tree]], commonly reaching a height of {{convert|15|\u2013|25|m|ft|abbr=on}}, exceptionally {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Its spread will generally be {{convert|11|\u2013|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide. A 10-year-old sapling will stand about {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. It is often found along waterways and in wetlands, leading to the colloquial name \"water maple\". It is a highly adaptable tree, although it has higher sunlight requirements than other maple trees.\n\n[[Image:Silver Maple Acer saccharinum Leaves 2598px.jpg|thumb|left|Silver maple leaves]]\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are [[leaf shape|simple]] and palmately veined, 8\u201316&nbsp;cm long and 6\u201312&nbsp;cm broad, with deep angular notches between the five lobes. The 5\u201312&nbsp;cm long, slender stalks of the leaves mean that even a light breeze can produce a striking effect as the downy silver undersides of the leaves are exposed. The autumn color is less pronounced than in many maples, generally ending up a pale yellow, although some specimens can produce a more brilliant yellow and even orange and red colorations. The tree has a tendency to color and drop its leaves slightly earlier in autumn than other maples.\n\n[[Image:Soft Maple Helicopter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Samara (fruit)|Samaras]] and leaves forming in April.]]\nThe [[flower]]s are in dense clusters, produced before the leaves in early spring,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_IJM.pl?key=10696|title=Jepson Flora Project}}</ref> with the [[seed]]s maturing in early summer. The fruit are [[Samara (fruit)|samaras]], each containing a single seed, and winged, in pairs, small (5\u201310&nbsp;mm diameter), the wing about 3\u20135&nbsp;cm long. The fruit are the largest of any native maple. Although the wings provide for some transport by air, the fruit are heavy and are also transported by water. Silver Maple and its close cousin [[Red Maple]] are the only ''Acer'' species which produce their fruit crop in spring instead of fall. The seeds of both trees have no epigeal dormancy and will germinate immediately.\n\nOn mature trunks, the bark is gray and shaggy. On branches and young trunks, the bark is smooth and silvery gray.\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[File:2014-11-02 15 41 21 Silver Maple foliage during autumn along Glen Mawr Drive in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|thumb|right|Typical yellow autumn leaf color]]\n[[File:2014-11-02 15 14 57 Silver Maple foliage during autumn along Pingree Avenue in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|right|thumb|Atypical reddish autumn color; this sort of coloration is sporadic and uncommon]]\nWildlife uses the silver maple in various ways. In many parts of the eastern U.S., the large rounded buds are one of the primary food sources for [[squirrels]] during the spring, after many acorns and nuts have sprouted and the squirrels' food is scarce. The seeds are also a food source for squirrels, [[chipmunk]]s and birds. The bark can be eaten by [[beaver]] and [[deer]]. The trunks tend to produce cavities, which can shelter squirrels, [[raccoon]]s, [[opossum]]s, [[owl]]s and [[woodpecker]]s.<ref name=USDA_Plant_Guide>{{cite web|last=Geyer|first=W.

It is highly tolerant of urban situations, and is frequently planted next to streets. However, its quick growth produces brittle wood, and is commonly damaged in storms. The silver maple's root system is shallow and fibrous, and easily invades septic fields and old drain pipes; it can also crack sidewalks and foundations. It is a vigorous resprouter, and if not pruned, will often grow with multiple trunks. Although it naturally is found near water, it can grow on drier ground if planted there. In ideal natural conditions, ''A. saccharinum'' may live up 130 years, but in urban environments often 80 or less.\n\nFollowing WWII, silver maples were commonly used as a landscaping and street tree in suburban housing developments and cities due to their rapid growth, especially as a replacement for the blighted [[American Elm]]. However, they fell out of favor for this purpose because of brittle wood, unattractive form when not pruned or trained, and tendency to produce large numbers of volunteer seedlings, and nowadays it is much less popular for this purpose to the point where some towns and cities banned its use as a street tree.\n\nIt is also commonly cultivated outside its native range, showing tolerance of a wide range of climates, growing successfully as far north as central [[Norway]] and south to [[Orlando, Florida]]. It can thrive in a [[Mediterranean climate]], as at [[Jerusalem]] and [[Los Angeles]], if summer water is provided. It is also grown in temperate parts of the [[Southern Hemisphere]]: [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]], the [[Brazil|southern states of Brazil]] (as well as in a few low-temperature locations within the states of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Minas Gerais]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe silver maple is closely related to the [[red maple]] (''[[Acer rubrum]]''), and can hybridise with it. The [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] variation is known as the Freeman maple (''Acer'' x ''freemanii''). The Freeman maple is a popular ornamental tree in [[park]]s and large [[garden]]s, combining the fast growth of silver maple with the less brittle wood, less invasive roots, and the beautiful bright red fall foliage of the red maple.\n\nThe silver maple is the favoured [[Host (biology)|host]] of the [[Parasitism|parasitic]] [[Pulvinaria innumerabilis|cottony maple scale]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} and the maple bladder gall mite ''[[Vasates quadripedes]]''.<ref name=\"Redfern\">{{cite book|author1=Redfern M. |author2=Shirley P.R. |author3=Bloxham M. |title=British Plant Galls (Second Edition)|year=2011|publisher=Field Studies Council|location=Preston Montford|isbn=978 1 85153 284 1|page=23}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nIn the English Christmas carol, \"Wassail, Wassail All Over the Town\", the \"white maple\" in  [[Wassailing#Wassail bowls|\"Our bowl, it is made of the white maple tree\"]] refers not to the silver (white) maple, but the wood of the sycamore maple, ''[[Acer pseudoplatanus]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ACSA2 United States Department of Agriculture Plants Profile: ''Acer saccharinum'']\n*[http://www.hort.uconn.edu/plants/a/acesac/acesac1.html University of Connecticut Plant Database: Silver Maple]\n*[http://wildwnc.org/trees/Acer_saccharinum.html Trees of Western North Carolina: Silver Maple]\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/acsa2.htm ''Acer saccharinum'' images from Vanderbilt University]\n*[http://www.google.com/tree/Silver_maple.html Trees of Western North Carolina: Silver]\n* [http://www.portraitoftheearth.com/trees/redsilvermaple.html Portrait of the Earth, Winter ID pictures]\n*[http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/acer-saccharinum-silver-maple-native-range-map.php Plant Maps, Interactive Distribution Map for ''Acer saccharinum'']\n*[http://www.tropicos.org/Image/88052 photo of herbarium specimen at Missouri Botanical Garden, collected in Missouri in 1989]\n{{Commons category|Acer saccharinum}}\n\n[[Category:Acer|saccharinum]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Flora of Southeastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Plants used in Native American cuisine]]\n[[Category:Plants used in traditional Native American medicine]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

When healthy, the sugar maple can live for over 400 years.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are deciduous, up to {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and equally wide,<ref name=nopd /> with five palmate lobes. The basal lobes are relatively small, while the upper lobes are larger and deeply notched. In contrast with the angular notching of the [[silver maple]], however, the notches tend to be rounded at their interior. The fall color is often spectacular, ranging from bright yellow through orange to fluorescent red-orange, although they look best in the northern part of its range. Sugar maples also have a tendency to color unevenly in fall. In some trees, all colors above can be seen at the same time. They also share a tendency with [[red maple]]s for certain parts of a mature tree to change color weeks ahead of or behind the remainder of the tree. The leaf buds are pointy and brown-colored. The recent year's growth twigs are green, and turn dark brown.\n\n[[File:Acer saccharum seeds.jpg|Fruit of ''Acer saccharum''|thumb|left|A pair of samaras]]\nThe [[flower]]s are in [[panicle]]s of five to 10 together, yellow-green and without [[petal]]s; flowering occurs in early spring after 30\u201355 [[growing degree day]]s. The sugar maple will generally begin flowering when it is between 10 and 15 years old. The fruit is a pair of [[Samara (fruit)|samara]]s (winged seeds). The seeds are globose, {{convert|7|\u2013|10|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} in diameter, the wing {{convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long. The seeds fall from the tree in autumn, where they must be exposed to 90 days of temperatures below {{convert|-18|C|F}} to break their coating down. Germination of ''A. saccharum'' is slow, not taking place until the following spring when the soil has warmed and all frost danger is past.<ref name=\"CopelandMcDonald2001\">{{Cite journal|author1=Lawrence O.

The western American [[bigtooth maple]] (''Acer grandidentatum'') is also treated as a variety or subspecies of sugar maple by some botanists.\n\nThe sugar maple is also often confused with the [[Norway maple]], though they are not closely related within the genus. The sugar maple is most easily identified by clear sap in the leaf [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] (the Norway maple has white sap), brown, sharp-tipped buds (the Norway maple has blunt, green or reddish-purple buds), and shaggy bark on older trees (the Norway maple bark has small grooves). Also, the leaf lobes of the sugar maple have a more triangular shape, in contrast to the squarish lobes of the Norway maple.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAlthough many people think a red sugar [[maple leaf]] is featured on the [[flag of Canada]], the official maple leaf does not belong to any particular maple species; although it perhaps most closely resembles a sugar maple leaf of all the maple species in Canada, the leaf on the flag was specially designed to be as identifiable as possible on a flag waving in the wind without regard to whether it resembled a particular species' foliage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/df1_e.cfm|title=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/df1_e.cfm|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Maple birch2.jpg|thumb|left|Sugar maple\u2013yellow birch forest, [[Jacques-Cartier National Park]], Quebec, Canada]]\nThe sugar maple is an extremely important species to the ecology of many forests in the northern United States and Canada. Pure stands are common, and it is a major component of the [[northern hardwood forest|northern]] and midwestern U.S. hardwood forests.\n\nSugar maple is native to areas with cooler climates. In northern parts of its range, January temperatures average about {{convert|-18|C|F}} and July temperatures about {{convert|16|C|F}}; in southern parts, January temperatures average about {{convert|10|C|F}} and July temperatures average almost {{convert|27|C|F}}.<ref>{{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Acer |species=saccharum |first1=Richard M. |last1=Godman |first2=Harry W. |last2=Yawney |first3=Carl H. |last3=Tubbs}}</ref>\n\n''Acer saccharum'' is among the most [[shade tolerant]] of large deciduous trees. Its shade tolerance is exceeded only by the [[striped maple]], a smaller tree. Like other maples, its shade tolerance is manifested in its ability to germinate and persist under a closed canopy as an understory plant, and respond with rapid growth to the increased light formed by a gap in the canopy. The sugar maple can grow comfortably in any type of soil except sand.\n\nSugar maples engage in [[Hydraulic redistribution|hydraulic lift]], drawing water from lower soil layers and exuding that water into upper, drier soil layers. This not only benefits the tree itself, but also many other plants growing around it.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n1n685611216p3l0/ |title=Hydraulic lift and its influence on the water content of the rhizosphere: an example from sugar maple, Acer saccharum |date= |accessdate=2011-03-03 |doi=10.1007/BF00334651 |volume=108 |journal=Oecologia |pages=273\u2013278}}</ref>\n\nHuman influences have contributed to the decline of the sugar maple in many regions. Its role as a species of mature forests has led it to be replaced by more opportunistic species in areas where forests are cut over. The sugar maple also exhibits a greater susceptibility to pollution than other species of maple. [[Acid rain]] and [[soil acidification]] are some of the primary contributing factors to [[maple decline]]. Also, the increased use of salt over the last several decades on streets and roads for deicing purposes has decimated the sugar maple's role as a street tree.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn some parts of New England, particularly near urbanized areas, the sugar maple is being displaced by the [[Acer platanoides|Norway maple]]. The Norway maple is also highly shade tolerant, but is considerably more tolerant of urban conditions, resulting in the sugar maple's replacement in those area. In addition, Norway maple produces much larger crops of seeds, allowing it to out-compete native species.\n\n== Cultivation and uses ==\n\n=== Maple syrup ===\n[[File:Maple sap buckets - Beaver Meadow Audubon Center.jpg|thumb|left|Collecting sap from sugar maples]]\nThe sugar maple is one of the most important [[Trees of Canada|Canadian trees]], being, with the black maple, the major source of sap for making [[maple syrup]].<ref name=Heilingmann>{{cite web|last=Heilingmann |first=Randall B |title=Hobby Maple Syrup Production (F-36-02) |url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/for-fact/0036.html |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020917225722/http://ohioline.osu.edu/for-fact/0036.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-09-17 |publisher=Ohio State University }}</ref> Other maple species can be used as a sap source for maple syrup, but some have lower sugar contents and/or produce more cloudy syrup than these two.<ref name=Heilingmann /> Some other trees ([[Betula|birch]], [[Fraxinus|ash]], etc.) can yield a useful syrup as well, though with different flavors.<ref>Gibbons, E. 1962. Stalking the Wild Asparagus. David McKay.</ref>\nIn maple syrup production from ''Acer saccharum'', the sap is extracted from the trees using a tap placed into a hole drilled through the phloem, just inside the bark. The collected sap is then boiled. As the sap boils, the water is evaporated off and the syrup left behind. 40 litres of maple sap are required to be boiled to produce only 1 litre of pure syrup. This is the reason for the high cost of pure maple syrup.\n\n=== Timber ===\n[[File:Houghilluminated.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Ultra-thin sugar maple sections from [[Romeyn Beck Hough]]'s ''American Woods''.

Cassens|title=Hard or sugar maple|url=https://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/FNR/FNR-287-W.pdf|publisher=Purdue University:Purdue Extension}}</ref> Bowling alleys and [[bowling pins]] are both commonly manufactured from sugar maple. Trees with wavy woodgrain, which can occur in curly, quilted, and \"[[birdseye maple]]\" forms, are especially valued. Maple is also the wood used for [[basketball courts]], including the floors used by the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and it is a popular wood for [[baseball bats]], along with [[White Ash|white ash]]. It is also widely used in the manufacture of musical instruments, such as the members of the violin family (sides and back), guitars (neck), and drum shells. It is also quite flexible and makes excellent [[Bow (archery)|archery bows]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nCanadian maple, often referred to as \"Canadian hardrock maple\", is prized for [[pool cue]]s, especially the shafts. Some production-line cues will use lower-quality maple wood with cosmetic issues, such as \"sugar marks\", which are most often light brown discolorations caused by sap in the wood. The best shaft wood has a very consistent grain, with no marks or discoloration. Sugar marks usually do not affect how the cue plays, but are not as high quality as those without it. This wood is also used in decks for its strength.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Urban planting ===\n[[File:2014-11-02 15 25 30 Sugar Maple during autumn along Patton Drive in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|Sugar maple in a suburban landscape]]\n[[File:2014-11-02 15 08 37 Sugar Maple foliage during autumn along Parkway Avenue in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|right|Closeup of autumn foliage]]\nThe sugar maple was a favorite street and park tree during the 19th century because it was easy to propagate and transplant, is fairly fast-growing, and has beautiful fall color.{{contradiction inline |reason= [[Acer saccharum#Ecology]]: \"'' However, like most climax forest species, sugar maple is not well-suited for landscaping due to its large size, relatively slow growth, and dense network of fibrous surface roots which can make gardening under it difficult due to their monopolization of moisture and soil nutrients.''\"|date=February 2015}} As noted above however, it proved too delicate to continue in that role after the rise of automobile-induced pollution and was replaced by [[Platanus occidentalis]] and other hardier species. The shade and the shallow, fibrous [[root]]s may interfere with grass growing under the trees. Deep, well-drained [[loam]] is the best rooting medium, although sugar maples can grow well on sandy soil which has a good buildup of [[humus]]. Light (or loose) clay soils are also well known to support sugar maple growth. Poorly drained areas are unsuitable, and the species is especially short-lived on flood-prone clay flats. Its salt tolerance is low and it is very sensitive to [[boron]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n==== Cultivars ====\n*'Apollo' \u2013 columnar\n*'Arrowhead' \u2013 pyramidal crown\n*'Astis' ('Steeple') \u2013 heat-tolerant, good in southeastern USA, oval crown\n*'Bonfire' \u2013 fast growing\n*'Caddo' \u2013 naturally occurring southern ecotype or subspecies, from [[Southwestern Oklahoma]], great drought and heat tolerance, good choice for the Great Plains region<ref>{{cite web|title=Putting Down Roots: Landscape Guidelines for the Selection, Care, and Maintenance of Trees In Central Oklahoma|url=http://okplanttrees.okstate.edu/resources/educational/pdr/section3.html#caddo|website=okPLANTtrees|location=3.1.2:MEDIUM DECIDUOUS TREES|quote=Fortunately for Oklahoma, a subspecies (believed to be an ecotype) of the Sugar Maple was discovered in the southwest part of the state that is specifically adapted to our hot summers and drying winds.}}</ref>\n*'Columnare' ('Newton Sentry') \u2013 very narrow\n*'Fall Fiesta' \u2013 tough-leaved, colorful in season, above-average hardiness\n*'Goldspire' \u2013 columnar with yellow-orange fall color\n*'Green Mountain' (PNI 0285) \u2013 durable foliage resists heat and drought, oval crown, above-average hardiness\n*'Inferno' \u2013 very hardy, with more red fall color than 'Lord Selkirk' or 'Unity'\n*'Legacy' \u2013 tough, vigorous and popular\n*'Lord Selkirk' \u2013 very hardy, more upright than other northern cultivars\n*'Monumentale' \u2013 columnar\n*'Sweet Shadow' \u2013 lacy foliage\n*'Temple's Upright' \u2013 almost as narrow as 'Columnare'\n*'Unity' \u2013 very hardy, from Manitoba, slow steady growth\n\n=== Use by Native Americans ===\nThe [[Mohegan]] use the inner bark as a cough remedy, and the sap as a sweetening agent and to make maple syrup.<ref>Tantaquidgeon, Gladys 1972 Folk Medicine of the Delaware and Related Algonkian Indians.

The small tree or shrub is native to the southern and eastern parts of the [[United States]], found from [[Illinois]] to [[Virginia]] in the north and from [[Texas]] to [[Florida]] in the south. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}It is hardy far to the north of its native range, with successful cultivation poleward to Arboretum Mustila in [[Finland]].<ref>http://www.mustila.fi/en/plants/aesculus/pavia</ref>\n\nIt has a number of local names, such as scarlet buckeye, '''woolly buckeye''' and firecracker plant.\n\nThe red buckeye is a large [[shrub]] or small [[tree]]. It reaches a height of 16-26 feet, often growing in a multi-stemmed form.  Its leaves are opposite, and are composed usually of five elliptical serrated leaflets, each 4-6 inches long.  It bears 4-7 inches long clusters of attractive dark red tubular flowers in the spring. The flowers are [[hermaphrodite]]. The smooth light brown fruits, about one inch or so in diameter, reach maturity in early autumn.\n\nThere are two [[variety (biology)|varieties]]:\n*''Aesculus pavia'' var. ''pavia'': typical red buckeye.\n*''Aesculus pavia'' var. ''flavescens'': yellow-flowered red buckeye.\n\nThe yellow-flowered variety, var. ''flavescens'', is found in higher country in Texas, and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] with intermediate flower color occur.\n\nThe flowers are attractive to [[hummingbird]]s as well as [[bee]]s. The fruits are rich in [[saponin]]s, which are poisonous to humans, although not particularly dangerous because they are not ingested easily.  The oils can be extracted to make [[soap]], although this is not viable commercially.\n\nOrnamental [[cultivar]]s such as the low-growing 'Humilis' have been selected for garden use.\n\nRed buckeye has hybridized with common horse-chestnut (''[[Aesculus hippocastanum]]'') in cultivation, the hybrid being named ''[[Aesculus \u00d7 carnea]]'', red horse-chestnut. The hybrid is a medium-sized tree to 45-55 feet tall, intermediate between the parent species in most respects, but inheriting the red flower color from ''A. pavia''. It is a popular tree in large [[garden]]s and [[park]]s, most commonly the selected [[cultivar]] 'Briotii'.  Hybrids of red buckeye with [[yellow buckeye]] (''A. flava'') have also been found, and named ''Aesculus \u00d7 hybrida''.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Red Buckeye Aesculus pavia Flowers 2000px.jpg|A red flower stalk\nImage:Aesculus pavia 2.jpg|Growing habit\nFile:Red Buckeye Aesculus pavia Leaf Cluster 2800px.jpg|Leaf cluster\n<!-- to add more pictures follow the example: Example.jpg|Caption2 -->\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|Aesculus pavia}}{{wikispecies}}\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=AEPA USDA plant profile for Red Buckeye]\n*[http://www.swsbm.com/Images/New2-2001/Aesculus_pavia-flavescens.jpg photo of Yellow Red Buckeye]\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/aepa.htm ''Aesculus pavia'' images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu]\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n[[Category:Aesculus|pavia]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Plains-Midwest (United States)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]",

The goal of Alabama's program is to record, heighten awareness of, and preserve the largest tree specimens in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.forestry.state.al.us/ChampionTreeProgram.aspx |title=Champion Tree Program |work=Alabama Forestry Commission |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}</ref>  It uses the same formula for recording tree specimens that was developed by American Forests.  Former champions are removed from the list as new, larger, champions are identified and recorded.  Although introduced species that have naturalized are generally eligible for the program, those species that the Alabama Invasive Plant Council considers to be [[Invasive species|invasive]] were removed from the listing in 2011 and are no longer eligible.  With the addition of 20 new specimens in 2011, the program had a total of 159 Champion Trees listed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.alabama.gov/pr/pr.aspx?id=5402&t=1 |title=New Champion Trees for

''Alnus maritima'' is [[Endemism|endemic]] to the [[United States]], and is found naturally in three disjunct populations in Oklahoma, Georgia, and in Maryland and Delaware on the Delmarva Peninsula.  In 2002, the three populations were recognized as subspecies and given the names ''Alnus maritima'' subsp. ''oklahomensis'', ''Alnus maritima'' subsp. ''georgiensis'', and ''Alnus maritima'' subsp. ''maritima'', respectively.<ref name=\"taxonomy\">Schrader, J.A. and W.R. Graves.  2002.  Infraspeci\ufb01c systematics of ''Alnus maritima'' (Betulaceae) from three widely disjunct provenances.  Castanea 67: 380\u2013401.</ref>  While some believe that subspecies ''maritima'' is the oldest of the three subspecies and that the other two disjunct populations resulted from some form of long distance dispersal, evidence from morphometric and phylogeographic studies indicates that the Oklahoma population (subsp. ''oklahomensis'') is in fact the most ancestral and that the species probably had a wide, continuous distribution across the United States in the past.<ref name=\"taxonomy\" /><ref>Schrader, J.A. and W.R. Graves.  2004.  Systematics of Alnus maritima (seaside alder) resolved by ISSR polymorphisms and morphological characters.  J. Amer. Soc. Hort. Sci. 129: 231\u2013236.</ref>\n\n''Alnus maritima'' is considered a large shrub or small tree and is the only autumn-blooming member of its genus native to North America.  All other North American alders bloom in the spring.  The autumn-blooming phenology is a characteristic that ''Alnus maritima'' shares with two old-world ''Alnus'' species, ''Alnus nitida'' and ''Alnus nepalensis'', which are endemic to southeast Asia.  This profound similarity in their timing of anthesis has led to their classification as the only three members in the subgenus ''Clethropsis''.<ref name=\"taxonomy\" />\n\n== Sources ==\n* World Conservation Monitoring Centre 1998.

It ranged from [[Maine]] and [[southern Ontario]] to [[Mississippi]], and from the [[Atlantic]] coast to the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and the [[Ohio Valley]]. It has several related [[chestnut]] species, such as the European [[sweet chestnut]], [[Castanea mollissima|Chinese chestnut]], and [[Japanese chestnut]], which are distinguishable from the American species by a few morphological traits, such as leaf shape, petiole length and nut size. ''C. dentata'' was once one of the most common trees in the [[Northeastern United States]]. In [[Pennsylvania]] alone, it is estimated to have comprised 25\u201330% of all hardwoods. The tree's huge population was due to a combination of rapid growth and a large annual seed crop in comparison to oaks which do not reliably produce sizable numbers of acorns every year. Nut production begins when ''C. dentata'' is 7\u20138 years old.\n\n''C. dentata'' can be best identified by the larger and more widely spaced saw-teeth on the edges of its leaves, as indicated by the scientific name ''dentata'', Latin for \"toothed\". The [[leaf|leaves]], which are {{convert|14|\u2013|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|7|\u2013|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} broad, also tend to average slightly shorter and broader than those of the sweet chestnut. The blight-resistant Chinese chestnut is now the most commonly planted chestnut species in the US, while the European chestnut is the source of commercial nuts in recent decades. It can be distinguished from the American chestnut by its hairy twig tips which are in contrast to the hairless twigs of the American chestnut. The chestnuts are in the beech family along with [[beech]] and [[oak]], but are not closely related to the horse-chestnut, which is in the family [[Sapindaceae]].\n\nThe chestnut is monoecious, producing many small, pale green (nearly white) male flowers found tightly occurring along 6 to 8 inch long catkins. The female parts are found near base of the catkins (near twig) and appear in late spring to early summer. Like all members of the Fagaceae family, American chestnut is self-incompatible and requires two trees for pollination, which can be any member of the Castanea genus.\n\nThe American chestnut is a prolific bearer of [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], usually with three nuts enclosed in each spiny, green burr, and lined in tan velvet. The nuts develop through late summer, with the burrs opening and falling to the ground near the first fall frost.\n\nThe American chestnut was a very important tree for wildlife, providing much of the fall [[mast (botany)|mast]] for species such as [[white-tailed deer]] and [[wild turkey]] and, formerly, the [[passenger pigeon]]. [[American black bear|Black bears]] were also known to eat the nuts to fatten up for the winter. The American chestnut also contains more [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]] and [[magnesium]] in its leaves when compared to other trees that share its habitat. This means they return more nutrients to the soil which helps with the growth of other plants, animals, and [[microorganism]]s.<ref name=blight>Jabr, Ferris.

The disease was first noticed on American chestnut trees in what was then the New York Zoological Park, now known as the [[Bronx Zoo]], in 1904, by chief forester [[Hermann Merkel]]. Merkel estimated that by 1906 blight had infected 98 percent of the chestnut trees in the [[Bronx]] alone.<ref name=merkel>Merkel, Hermann W.

Both Elkins and Griffin have written extensively about the American chestnut.<ref name=griffin>[http://www.accf-online.org/biblio.html \"Bibliography.\"] ''www.accf-online.org.'' Retrieved January 11, 2016.</ref>  They believe that by making intercrosses among resistant American chestnuts from many locations, they will continue to improve upon the levels of blight resistance to make an American chestnut that can compete in the forest. Griffin, who has been involved with American chestnut restoration for many years,<ref name=griffin/> developed a scale for assessing levels of blight resistance, which made it possible to make selections scientifically. He inoculated five-year-old chestnuts with a standard lethal strain of the blight fungus and measured growth of the cankers. Chestnuts with no resistance to blight make rapid-growing, sunken cankers that are deep and kill tissue right to the wood. Resistant chestnuts make slow-growing, swollen cankers that are superficial: live tissue can be recovered under these cankers. The level of blight resistance is judged by periodic measurement of cankers. Grafts from large survivors of the blight epidemic were evaluated following inoculations, and controlled crosses among resistant American chestnut trees were made beginning in 1980. The first \"All-American intercrosses\" were planted in Virginia Tech's Martin American Chestnut Planting in [[Giles County, Virginia]], and in [[Beckley, West Virginia]]. They were inoculated in 1990 and evaluated in 1991 and 1992. Nine of the trees showed resistance equal to their parents, and four of these had resistance comparable to hybrids in the same test.<ref name=griffin/><ref name=elkins>Griffin, G.J., J.R. Elkins, D.

The seeds and fruit of this plant can be dispersed during wet seasons where they fall into swamps and rivers. This allows the seeds and fruits to spread to coastlines. A 2008 study found that ''A. glabra'' seeds can withstand floating in salt water and fresh water for up to 12 months. About 38% of those seeds can then germinate in soil, though ''A. glabra'' roots do not do well with constant flooding.<ref name=\"Buoyancy\">{{cite journal |vauthors =Setter SD, et al |journal=Sixteenth Australian Weeds Conference|year=2008|title=Buoyancy and germination of pond apple (Annona glabra L.) propagules in fresh and salt water|pages=140\u2013142 |accessdate=2017-03-24}}</ref> Another study in 1998 found that even under intense flooding, the 12-month lifespan of ''A. glabra'' seedlings was unaffected; the growth rate of ''A. glabra'' trees did decrease however over a 6-month period.

The plan includes six steps that property owners can take to determine how to control and monitor an outbreak of ''A. glabra'' as well as how to minimize financial damage. To disincentivize the cultivation and spread of ''A. glabra'' by humans, its sale and entry is banned throughout most of Australia.<ref name=\"Control methods and Case Studies\"/> \n\nOptions for the control of the ''A. glabra'' include fire, chemical, and mechanical controls including combinations of the three types. The best time of year to do so according to the government of Australia is during the time between August to November, which is the dry season. There are currently no studies that have looked at the biological control of ''A. glabra'' within Australia. Without studies, any actions taken to eliminate the ''A. glabra'' with biological controls could inadvertently affect native Australian apple species that belong to the same family.<ref name=\"Control methods and Case Studies\"/> \n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Annona glabra}}\n{{wikispecies}}\n{{Grocers}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050717072546/http://www.deh.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/a-glabra.html Pond-apple as an invasive species in Australia]\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Annona|glabra]]\n[[Category:Tropical fruit]]\n[[Category:Invasive plant species]]\n[[Category:Flora of West Africa]]\n[[Category:Trees of Antigua and Barbuda]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Bahamas]]\n[[Category:Trees of Belize]]\n[[Category:Trees of Brazil]]\n[[Category:Trees of Colombia]]\n[[Category:Trees of Costa Rica]]\n[[Category:Trees of Cuba]]\n[[Category:Trees of Dominica]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ecuador]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guadeloupe]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Trees of Hispaniola]]\n[[Category:Trees of Honduras]]\n[[Category:Trees of Jamaica]]\n[[Category:Trees of Martinique]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Flora of Nigeria]]\n[[Category:Trees of Panama]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Flora of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]\n[[Category:Flora of Sierra Leone]]\n[[Category:Trees of northern South America]]\n[[Category:Invasive plant species in Sri Lanka]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]",

It is closely related to the Asian species ''[[Aralia elata]]'', a more commonly cultivated species with which it is easily confused.\n\n==Description==\n''Aralia spinosa'' is an aromatic spiny [[deciduous]] [[shrub]] or small tree growing {{convert|2|\u2013|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, with a simple or occasionally branched stem with very large bipinnate [[leaf|leaves]] {{convert|70|\u2013|120|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The trunks are up to {{convert|15|\u2013|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, with the plants umbrella-like in habit with open crowns. The young stems are stout and thickly covered with sharp spines. The plants generally grow in clusters of branchless trunks, although stout wide-spreading branches are occasionally produced.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nThe [[flower]]s are creamy-white, individually small (about 5&nbsp;mm or 0.2&nbsp;in across) but produced in large composite [[panicle]]s {{convert|30|\u2013|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; flowering is in the late summer. The [[fruit]] is a purplish-black [[berry (botany)|berry]] {{convert|6|\u2013|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, ripening in the fall. The roots are thick and fleshy.\n\nThe doubly or triply compound leaves are the largest of any temperate tree in the continental United States, often about a meter (three feet) long and 60&nbsp;cm (two feet) wide, with leaflets about {{convert|5|\u2013|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The petioles are prickly, with swollen bases. In the autumn the leaves turn to a peculiar bronze red touched with yellow which makes the tree conspicuous and attractive.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nThe habit of growth and general appearance of ''Aralia spinosa'' and related tree-forming ''Aralia'' species are unique. It is usually found as a group of unbranched stems, rising to the height of {{convert|3.5|\u2013|6|m|ft|abbr=on}}, which bear upon their summits a crowded cluster of doubly or triply compound leaves, thus giving to each stem a certain tropical [[palm (plant)|palm]]-like appearance. In the south it is said to reach the height of {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}}, still retaining its palm-like aspect. However, further north, the slender, swaying, palm-like appearance is most characteristic of younger plants that have not been damaged by winter storms.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n[[File:Aralia spinosa.jpg|thumb|The trunk, showing the bark, leaf scars, and spines.]]\n* Bark: Light brown, divided into rounded broken ridges. Branchlets one-half to two-thirds of an inch in diameter, armed with stout, straight or curved, scattered prickles and nearly encircled by narrow leaf scars. At first light yellow brown, shining and dotted, later light brown.\n* Wood: Brown with yellow streaks; light, soft, brittle, close-grained.\n* Winter buds: Terminal bud chestnut brown, one-half to three-fourths of an inch long, conical, blunt; axillary buds flattened, triangular, one-fourth of an inch in length.\n* Leaves: Clustered at the end of the branches, compound, bi- and tri-pinnate, three to four feet long, two and a half feet broad. The pinnae are unequally pinnate, having five or six pairs of leaflets and a long stalked terminal leaflet; these leaflets are often themselves pinnate. The last leaflets are ovate, two to three inches long, wedge-shaped or rounded at base, serrate or dentate, acute; midrib and primary veins prominent. They come out of the bud a bronze green, shining, somewhat hairy; when full grown are dark green above, pale beneath; midribs frequently furnished with prickles. Petioles stout, light brown, eighteen to twenty inches in length, clasping, armed with prickles. Stipules acute, one-half inch long.\n* Flowers: July, August. Perfect or [[polygamomonoecious]], cream white, borne in many-flowered umbels arranged in compound panicles, forming a terminal racemose cluster, three to four feet in length which rises, solitary or two or three together, above the spreading leaves. Bracts and bractlets lanceolate, acute, persistent.\n* Calyx: Calyx tube coherent with the ovary, minutely five-toothed.\n* Corolla: Petals five, white, inserted on margin of the disk, acute, slightly inflexed at the apex, imbricate in bud.\n* Stamens: Five, inserted on margin of the disk, alternate with the petals; filaments thread-like; anthers oblong, attached on the back, introrse, two-celled; cells opening longitudinally.\n* Pistil: Ovary inferior, five-celled; styles five, connivent; stigmas capitate.\n* Fruit: Berry-like drupe, globular, black, one-fourth of an inch long, five-angled, crowned with the blackened styles. Flesh thin, dark.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Aralia spinosa'' is widespread in the eastern [[United States]], ranging from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Florida]] along the Atlantic coast, and westward to [[Ohio]], [[Illinois]], and [[Texas]]. It prefers a deep moist soil.<ref name=Keeler />  The plants typically grow in the forest [[Understory]] or at the edges of forests, often forming [[vegetative reproduction|clonal]] thickets by sprouting from the roots.\n\nThis tree was admired by the [[Iroquois]] because of its usefulness, and for its rarity. The Iroquois would take the saplings of the tree and plant them near their villages and on islands, so that animals wouldn't eat the valuable fruit. The fruit was used in many of the natives' foods. The women would take the flowers and put them in their hair because of the lemony smell. The flowers could also be traded for money.\n\n==Uses==\n\nThe young leaves can be eaten if gathered before the prickles harden. They are then chopped finely and cooked as a [[potherb]].\n\n''Aralia spinosa'' was introduced into cultivation in 1688 and is still grown for its decorative foliage, prickly stems, large showy flower [[panicle]]s [clusters], and distinctive fall color. These plants are slow growing, tough and durable, do well in urban settings, but bear numerous prickles on their stems, petioles, and leaflets. These plants can be propagated from seeds or root cuttings.<ref>[[Janet Meakin Poor|Poor, Janet Meakin]], and Nancy P. Brewster. 1994. ''Plants that merit attention Vol 2, Shrubs''.

It is common throughout coastal areas of [[Texas]] and [[Florida]], and ranges as far north as southern [[Louisiana]] and coastal [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the [[United States]].\n\nLike many other [[mangrove]] species, it reproduces by [[vivipary]]. [[Seed]]s are encased in a [[fruit]], which reveals the [[Germination|germinated]] seedling when it falls into the water.\n\nUnlike other mangrove species, it does not grow on [[Aerial root#Aerial roots as supports|prop roots]], but possesses [[Aerial root#Pneumatophores|pneumatophores]] that allow its roots to breathe even when submerged. It is a hardy species and expels absorbed salt mainly from its leathery leaves.\n\nThe name \"black mangrove\" refers to the color of the trunk and [[Wood#Heartwood and sapwood|heartwood]]. The leaves often appear whitish from the [[salt]] [[Halophyte|excreted]] at night and on cloudy days. It is often found in its native range with the red mangrove (''[[Rhizophora mangle]]'') and the white mangrove (''[[Laguncularia racemosa]]''). White mangroves grow inland from black mangroves which themselves grow inland from red mangroves. The three species work together to stabilize the shoreline, provide buffers from [[storm surge]]s, trap debris and [[detritus]] brought in by [[tide]]s, and provide feeding, breeding, and nursery grounds for a great variety of [[fish]], [[shellfish]], [[bird]]s, and other wildlife.\n\n==Habitat==\n[[Image:Black mangrove-everglades natl park.jpg|left|thumb|A black mangrove tree growing in shallow water in [[Everglades National Park]]]]\n[[Image:Avicennia germinans-flowers2.jpg|left|thumb|Black mangrove flowers]]\nThe black mangrove grows just above the high [[tide]] in coastal [[lagoon]]s and [[brackish water]] [[Estuary|estuaries]]. It is less tolerant of highly saline conditions than certain other species that occur in mangrove ecosystems.<ref>World Wildlife Fund. 2010.

The [[seed]]s [[Germination|germinate]] in midsummer, but may be seen all year on the trees. The seeds can remain viable for over a year once released.\n\n==Wood==\nThe [[Wood#Heartwood and sapwood|heartwood]] is dark-brown to black, while the [[Wood#Heartwood and sapwood|sapwood]] is yellow-brown. It has the unusual property of having less dense heartwood than sapwood. The sapwood sinks in water while the heartwood floats. The wood is strong, heavy, and hard, but is difficult to work due to its interlocked grain and is somewhat difficult to finish due to its oily texture. Uses include posts, pilings, [[charcoal]], and [[Firewood|fuel]]. Despite growing in a marine environment, the dry wood is subject to attack by marine borers and [[termite]]s. Like many species, it contains [[tannin]] in the bark and has been used to [[Tanning (leather)|tan]] [[leather]] products.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*[[List of honey plants]]\n*[[:Category:Mangrove ecoregions|Mangrove ecoregions]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*  {{cite book\n | last = Haehle\n | first =  Robert\n | year = 1999\n | title = Native Florida Plants\n | publisher = Gulf Publishing Company\n | location = Houston\n | isbn = 0-88415-425-4\n}}\n* McKee, Karen L., Irving A.

The syncarp of ''Ficus'' species supplies shelter and food for [[fig wasp]]s and, in turn, the trees are totally dependent on the fig wasps for pollination.\n\n[[Frugivore]] birds disperse the seeds of banyans. The seeds are small, and because most banyans grow in [[woodland]]s, a seedling that germinates on the ground is unlikely to survive. However, many seeds fall on the branches and stems of other trees or on human edifices, and when they germinate they grow roots down toward the ground and consequently may envelop part of the host tree or edifice. For this reason banyans bear the colloquial name \"[[strangler fig]]\". A number of tropical banyan species that compete for sunlight, especially of the genus ''Ficus'', exhibit this strangling habit.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Zhou Zhekun |last2=Gilbert |first2=Michael G. |date=2003 |chapter=Moraceae |editor1=Zhengyi Wu |editor-last2=Raven |editor-first2=Peter H. |editor3=Deyuan Hong |title=Flora of China |url=http://hua.huh.harvard.edu/china/mss/volume05/Moraceae.pdf |volume=Volume 5 |pages=21\u201373 |isbn=1-930723-27-X |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901100148/http://hua.huh.harvard.edu/china/mss/volume05/Moraceae.pdf |archive-date=1 September 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Serventy |first=Vincent |date=1984 |title=Australian Native Plants |location=Frenchs Forest, NSW |publisher=Reed |page= |isbn=0-7301-0020-0}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2017}}<ref>{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=1992 |title=Light in the Rainforest |url=http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/register/p00820ar.pdf |magazine=Tropical Topics |volume=1 |issue=5 |publisher=Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage |page=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529233702/http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/register/p00820ar.pdf |archive-date=29 May 2009}}.</ref>\n\nThe leaves of the banyan tree are large, leathery, glossy, green, and elliptical. Like most figs, the leaf bud is covered by two large scales. As the leaf develops the scales abscise. Young leaves have an attractive reddish tinge.<ref name=\"The Lovely Plants\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thelovelyplants.com/the-banyan-tree/|title=The Banyan Tree|date=14 September 2010|website=The Lovely Plants}}</ref>\n\nOlder banyan trees are characterized by [[Aerial root|aerial prop roots]] that mature into thick, woody trunks, which can become indistinguishable from the primary trunk with age. Old trees can spread laterally by using these prop roots to grow over a wide area. In some species, the prop roots develop over a considerable area that resembles a grove of trees, with every trunk connected directly or indirectly to the primary trunk. The topology of this massive root system inspired the name of the [[Hierarchical#Degree of branching|hierarchical]] computer network operating system \"[[Banyan VINES]]\".\n\nIn a banyan that envelops its host tree, the mesh of roots growing around the latter eventually applies considerable pressure to and commonly kills it. Such an enveloped, dead tree eventually decomposes, so that the banyan becomes a \"columnar tree\" with a hollow, central core. In jungles, such hollows are very desirable shelters to many animals.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name was originally given to ''F. benghalensis'' and comes from India, where early travellers observed that the shade of the tree was frequented by ''[[Vanika|banias]]'' or Indian traders.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Yule |first1=Henry |last2=Burnell |first2=Arthur Coke |date=1903 |editor-last=Crooke |editor-first=William |title=Hobson-Jobson: A glossary of colloquial Anglo-Indian words and phrases, and of kindred terms, etymological, historical, geographical and discursive |url=https://archive.org/details/hobsonjobsonagl02croogoog |edition=New |location=London |publisher=J. Murray}}</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn the [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] language, ''banya'' means \"grocer or merchant\", not \"tree\". The Portuguese picked up the word to refer specifically to Hindu merchants, and passed it along to the English as early as 1599 with the same meaning. By 1634, English writers began to tell of the banyan tree, a tree under which Hindu merchants conducted their business. The tree provided a shaded place for a village meeting or for merchants to sell their goods. Eventually, \"banyan\" became the name of the tree itself.\n\n==Classification==\nThe original banyan, ''F. benghalensis'', can grow into a giant tree covering several hectares. Over time, the name became generalized to all [[strangler fig]]s of the ''Urostigma'' subgenus.  The many banyan species include:\n* ''[[Ficus microcarpa]]'', which is native from [[Sri Lanka]] through [[New Caledonia]], is a significant invasive species elsewhere.\n* The Central American banyan (''Ficus pertusa'') is native to [[Central America]] and northern [[South America]], from southern [[Mexico]] south to [[Paraguay]].\n* The shortleaf fig (''[[Ficus citrifolia]]'') is native to southern [[Florida]], the [[Caribbean]] Islands, Central America, and South America south to Paraguay.  One theory is that the Portuguese name for ''F. citrofolia'', ''os barbados'', gave [[Barbados]] its name.\n* The Florida strangler fig (''[[Ficus aurea]]'') is also native to southern Florida and the Caribbean Islands, and distinguished from the above by its coarser leaf venation.\n* The Moreton Bay fig (''[[Ficus macrophylla]]'') and [[Port Jackson fig]] (''Ficus rubiginosa'') are other related species.\n\n==In horticulture==\n[[Image:Strangler fig kerala.jpg|left|thumb|Early stages of a strangler fig on a host tree in the [[Western Ghats]], India]]\n[[File:Strangler fig inside.jpg|thumb|Looking upward inside a strangler fig where the host tree has rotted away, leaving a hollow, columnar tree]]\nDue to the complex structure of the roots and extensive branching, the banyan is used as a subject specimen in [[penjing]] and [[bonsai]]. The oldest, living bonsai in [[Taiwan]] is a 240-year-old banyan tree housed in [[Tainan]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Small Is the Old Big |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2005/09/22/2003272719 |newspaper=Taipei Times |date=22 September 2005}}</ref>\n\n==In culture==\n\n===Religion and mythology===\nBanyan trees figure prominently in several Asian and Pacific religions and myths, including:\n* The banyan tree is the national tree of India. It is also called Indian or Bengal fig. This tree is considered sacred in India and can be seen near a temple or religious center. It is a big tree and gives shade to travelers in very hot summer months. An old custom offers worship to this tree.\n* In [[Hinduism]], the leaf of the banyan tree is said to be the resting place for the god [[Krishna]].\n:In the Bhagavat Gita, Krishna said, \"There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its branches down, and the Vedic hymns are its leaves. One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas.\" (Bg 15.1) Here the material world is described as a tree whose roots are upwards and branches are below. We have experience of a tree whose roots are upward: if one stands on the bank of a river or any reservoir of water, he can see that the trees reflected in the water are upside down. The branches go downward and the roots upward. Similarly, this material world is a reflection of the spiritual world. The material world is but a shadow of reality. In the shadow there is no reality or substantiality, but from the shadow we can understand that there is substance and reality.\n\n:The banyan tree is also considered sacred and is called ''vat vriksha'' (IAST ''{{IAST|va\u1e6da v\u1e5bk\u1e63a}}'', \u0935\u091f \u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937) in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] known as: \u0c2e\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c30\u0c3f \u0c1a\u0c46\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c1f\u0c41; ''marri chettu'', and in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] known as: '\u0b86\u0bb2 \u0bae\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bcd' ; ''ala maram''.  The god [[Shiva]] as [[Dakshinamurthy]] is nearly always depicted sitting in silence under the banyan with rishis at his feet.

In younger trees the bark is characteristic of most [[birch]]es, with smooth bark and distinct horizontal [[lenticel]]s. It is sometimes mistakenly identified as a [[Prunus|cherry]] tree. In some older tree specimens the [[bark]] can (unlike most birches) develop vertical cracks into irregular scaly plates revealing rough darkish brown bark patterns. This, however, does not occur in all specimens.  The twigs, when scraped, have a strong scent of wintergreen due to [[methyl salicylate]], which is produced in the bark. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, ovate, {{convert|5|to(-)|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4|to(-)|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} broad, with a finely serrated margin. The [[flower]]s are [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]] [[catkin]]s {{convert|3|to(-)|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the male catkins pendulous, the female catkins erect. The [[fruit]], maturing in fall, is composed of numerous tiny winged [[seed]]s packed between the catkin bracts. Seed production mainly occurs in trees that are between 40 and 70 years old, although light crops may occur as early as 20 years. The average lifespan of ''B. lenta'' is 100 years, with a maximum of 150.\n\n''Betula lenta'' was used commercially in the past for production of oil of wintergreen before modern industrial synthesis of the oil; the tree's name reflects the wintergreen scent of the shoots.\n\nThe [[Plant sap|sap]] flows about a month later than [[maple]] sap, and much faster. The trees can be tapped in a similar fashion, but must be gathered about three times more often. [[Birch sap]] can be boiled the same as maple sap, but its syrup is stronger (like [[molasses]]).\n\nThe leaves of this species serve as food for some [[caterpillar]]s (see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on birches]]) and the solitary leaf-cutter bee ''[[Megachile rubi]]'' cuts pieces from the leaves to line the cells of its nest.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Eickwort, George C. |author2=Matthews, Robert W. |author3=Carpenter, James |year=1981 |title=Observations on the Nesting Behavior of ''Megachile rubi'' and ''M. texana'' with a Discussion of the Significance of Soil Nesting in the Evolution of Megachilid Bees (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) |journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society  |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=557\u2013570 |jstor=25084194 }}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nImage:BetulaLentaBark.jpg|Closeup of bark\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{Commonscat-inline|Betula lenta}}\n*[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233500250 Flora of North America: ''Betula lenta''] [http://www.efloras.org/object_page.aspx?object_id=5742&flora_id=1 RangeMap:]\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/bele.htm ''Betula lenta'' images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu]\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n[[Category:Betula|lenta]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Trees of Quebec]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Medicinal plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Trees of humid continental climate]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]",

It prefers poor, dry upland soils, but is also found in moist mixed woodlands. Living only about 30 years, it is a common [[pioneer species]] on abandoned fields and burned areas.\n\n==Characteristics==\nGray birch grows quickly to 20 to 30 feet tall and 15 inch trunk diameter, with an irregular open crown of slender branches.  The tree often has multiple trunks branching off of an old stump.  The [[leaf|leaves]] are 5-7.5&nbsp;cm long by 4\u20136&nbsp;cm wide, alternately arranged, ovate, and tapering to an elongated tip.

It is well adapted to several kinds of [[habitat]]s, which include salty and calcareous soils (however, it does not tolerate boggy soils). Due to this fact and its rapid growth, ''B. simaruba'' is planted for various purposes, notably in coastal areas. In addition, gumbo-limbo is also considered one of the most wind-tolerant trees, and it is recommended as a rugged, [[hurricane]]-resistant species in south Florida. They may be planted to serve as wind protection of crops and roads, or as [[Hedge#Live fencing|living fence]] posts, and if simply stuck into good soil, small branches will readily root and grow into sizeable trees in a few years. However, it has been noted in Central America that posts do not produce a tap root, only side roots, thus questioning the real value of wind protection as such fence posts would not be as sturdy as a true, naturally occurring sapling. In addition, gumbo-limbo wood is suitable for light construction<ref>. It is rather brittle, though the trunk is used in [[Haiti]] to make drums (Christman 2004).</ref> and as firewood, and the tree's [[resin]], called '''chibou''', '''cachibou''' or '''gomartis''',<ref name=christman2004 /> is used as glue, varnish and [[incense]].<ref name=foster2007 /><ref name=uflorida /> Gumbo-limbo is the traditional wood used for the manufacture of [[carousel]] horses in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe arils are an important source of food for birds, including many [[bird migration|winter migrants]] from North America. Local residents such as the [[masked tityra]], [[bright-rumped attila]], [[black-faced grosbeak]] and, in [[Hispaniola]], [[palmchat]], are particularly fond of gumbo-limbo fruit, as are migrants like the [[Baltimore oriole]] or the [[dusky-capped flycatcher]]. It is an especially important local food source for [[vireo]]s such the [[red-eyed vireo]] when ripe fruit are abundant. Especially notable is the fact that many migrant species will utilize gumbo-limbo trees that are in human-modified [[habitat]], even in settlements. This creates the opportunity to attract such species to residential areas for [[bird watching]], and to reduce the competition for gumbo-limbo seeds in an undisturbed habitat which rarer local resident birds might face. In addition, gumbo-limbo's rapid growth, ease and low cost of propagation, and ecological versatility makes it highly recommended as a \"starter\" tree in [[reforestation]], even of degraded habitat, and it performs much better overall in such a role than most exotic species.<ref name=foster2007 /><ref>{{aut|Foster, Mercedes S.}} (2007): The potential of fruiting trees to enhance converted habitats for migrating birds in southern Mexico.

Given the eagerness with which some birds seek out the arils, it may be that they contain lipids or other compounds useful to humans; in order for these to be exploited, however, they would probably have to be synthetically produced, because although the crop of a single tree can be very large (up to or even exceeding 15,000 fruits, translating into a raw lipid yield of over 200&nbsp;grams per harvest<ref name=foster2007 />), individual seeds are small and cumbersome to harvest.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*[[Bahamian dry forests]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{commons category}}\n\n[[Category:Bursera|simaruba]]\n[[Category:Flora of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puebla]]\n[[Category:Trees of Veracruz]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Caribbean]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Central America]]\n[[Category:Trees of South America]]\n[[Category:Flora of Florida]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]",

In the [[American South]] it is a dominant plant species found on clay flats and backwater areas near streams and rivers. The species reproduces aggressively both by seed and sprouts from roots and from stumps of cut trees. Water hickory is a major component of wetland forests now in the south eastern US, because of the selective cutting of more desirable tree species for the lumber industry. It is considered important in cleansing drainage waters since the plants slow water flow during flooding, allowing sediments to fall out of the water column. This tree species is tolerant of wet soils but grows best on well draining soils near rivers and other water ways.\n\n==Habitat==\n\n===Native range===\nWater hickory inhabits the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains from southeastern Virginia to southern Florida, Alabama, west into eastern Texas, and the Mississippi Valley north to southern Illinois.<ref name=\"silvics\">{{cite book |title= Water hickory (Carya aquatica (Michx. f.) Nutt.). In Silvics of forest trees of the United States |last1= Johnson |first1= R. L. |last2= Beaufait |first2= W. R. |year= 1965 |publisher= U.S. Department of Agriculture |location= Washington, DC. |pages= 136\u2013138 |series= Agriculture Handbook 271}}</ref>\n\n===Soils and topography===\nWater hickory attains its best growth on moist but well-drained loamy or silty soils in the Mississippi River Valley and along some Coastal Plain streams. However, because of its slow growth rate and past logging and land management practices, it is rare on these sites except where it has been favored by repeated \"high-grade\" logging.<ref name=\"silvics\" /> Water hickory is now most often found on wet sites where only a few other species of trees grow, it is somewhat intolerant of competition being shade intolerant. It is common on clay flats, sloughs, and backwater areas, but seldom in coastal swamps or sites where soils are continually saturated. The species is most common on soils in the Vertic Haplaquepts subgroup of the order [[Inceptisol]]s. Water hickory sites are subject to inundation during heavy rains and stream overflow, during droughts these sites dry out and develop cracking of the soil during occasional dry summers.\n\n===Associated forest cover===\nWater hickory is a major component of two forest cover types: Sugarberry-American Elm-Green Ash (Society of American Foresters Type 93) and Overcup Oak-Water Hickory (Type 96). It is a minor component in Sweetgurn-Willow Oak (Type 92) and is sometimes found on the edge of Baldcypress (Type 101) and Baldcypress-Tupelo (Type 102).<ref>{{cite book |title= Forest cover types of the United States and Canada |editor-first= F. H. |editor-last= Eyre |year= 1980 |publisher= Society of American Foresters |location= Washington, DC. |page= 148 }}</ref>\n\nImportant associated tree species are ''[[Quercus lyrata]]'' - Overcup oak, ''[[Quercus nuttallii]]'' - Nuttall oak, and ''[[Quercus phellos]]'' - Willow oaks; ''[[Ulmus crassifolia]]'' - Ceder elm and ''[[Ulmus americana]]'' - American elm; waterlocust and honeylocust (''Gleditsia aquatica'' and ''G. triacanthos''); pecan; green ash (''Fraxinus pennsylvanica''); sugarberry (''Celtis laevigata''); persimmon (''Diospyros virginiana''); red maple (''Acer rubrum''); and baldcypress (''Taxodium distichum'').\n\nThe most frequent noncommercial trees and shrubs associated with water hickory are hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), swamp-privet (''Forestiera acummata''), roughleaf dogwood (''Cornus drummondii''), buttonbush (''Cephalanthus occidentalis''), possumhaw (''Ilex decidua''), and water-elm (''Planera aquatica'').\n\n==Life history==\n\n===Reproduction and early growth===\nWater hickory regenerates aggressively from seeds and sprouts. Seeds germinate and become established on disturbed soil or understory duff. To develop, understory seedlings must be released. Many of our present stands of water hickory, especially on imperfectly drained flats, have been regenerated and released by heavy preferential logging of more valuable species. On poorly drained sites, where competition is not so intense, water hickory grows to fill openings created by windthrow and natural mortality as well as logging.\n\n'''Flowering and fruiting'''- Water hickory is monoecious. Male and female flowers appear during April and May, while the leaves are developing. The male flowers are in stalked catkins on branches of the current or previous year, and the female flowers are in short spikes or stalks. The fruit, covered by a thin husk during development, are thin-shelled, flattened, and have a bitter seed. Nuts fall between October and December of the same year.\n\n'''Seed production and dissemination'''- Seed production begins when the trees are about 20 years old, or about {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in [[d.b.h.]].<ref>{{cite book|title= Seeds of woody plants in the United States |editor-first= C. S. |editor-last= Schopmeyer |year= 1974 |publisher= U.S. Department of Agriculture |location= Washington, DC. |page= 883 |series= Agriculture Handbook 450}}</ref> Optimum seed-bearing age is from 40 to 75 years, or after the trees reach {{convert|51|cm|in|abbr=on}} in d.b.h. Heavy seed crops are produced in most years, and a thrifty tree may produce up to 70 liters (2 bu) of seeds. There are approximately 440 cleaned seeds per kilogram (200/lb). The seeds are disseminated by water and animals; floodwaters are particularly important in carrying seed to new areas.\n\n'''Seedling development'''- After seedfall in the autumn, the seeds lie dormant until germination in late April through early June. Rarely do they remain viable until the second spring. Germination is [[hypogeal germination|hypogeal]]. Sometimes nearly 80 percent of the seed crop germinates.<ref name=\"characteristics\">{{Citation | last = Nelson | first = Thomas C. | year = 1965 | title = Silvical characteristics of the commercial hickories | publisher = USDA Forest Service | publication-place = Southeastern Forest Experiment Station, Asheville, NC. | page = 16| series = Hickory Task Force Report 10 | mode=cs1}}</ref> As a result, thickets and clumps of water hickory are not unusual. The species is tolerant enough to survive in the understory for at least 15 years, but full sunlight is necessary for development into trees.<ref>{{Citation | last = Johnson | first = Robert L. | year = 1975 | title = Natural regeneration and development of Nuttall oak and associated species | publisher = USDA Forest Service | series = Research Paper SO-104 | publication-place = Southern Forest Experiment Station, New Orleans, LA. | page = 12 |mode=cs1}}</ref> The relatively slow height growth of water hickory requires that it have near freedom from competition to establish itself in the overstory. Because of their extended dormant season, water hickory seedlings are able to survive late-spring floods better than most of their would-be competitors.\n\n'''Vegetative reproduction'''- Stumps less than {{convert|61|cm|in|abbr=on}} and severed roots of water hickory readily sprout. Sprouts grow three or four times faster than seedlings during the first year or two. Even on poorly drained clay soil, first-year sprouts sometimes are {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. Sprouts {{convert|4.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall at 5 years have been reported.\n\n'''Sapling and pole stages to maturity'''\n'''Growth and Yield'''- Water hickory on a good site may reach {{convert|33.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|91|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter,<ref name=\"characteristics\" /> with about {{convert|16|m|ft|abbr=on}} of merchantable bole. The tall straight trunk is topped by slender to moderately stout ascending branches. Diameter growth of water hickory is slow for southern species, {{convert|2|to|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year. At 50 years, dominants might average {{convert|35|cm|in|abbr=on}} in d.b.h. on good sites and only {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} on poor sites. Site index at base age 50 years ranges between {{convert|20|and|29|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Slow growth rates are typical of water hickory in competition with oaks, sugarberry, gum, and other species on good sites.\n\nMaximum mean annual production of a pure stand (found rarely) on a good site has been established at 10.5 m\u00b3/ha (150&nbsp;ft\u00b3/acre).<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Putnam | first1 = John A. | last2 = Broadfoot | first2 = W. M. | year = 1965 | title = Maximum potential total yields of normal stands of southern hardwoods by species groups and site classes | publisher = USDA Forest Service, Southern Forest Experiment Station| publication-place = Southern Hardwoods Laboratory, Stoneville, MS. | page = 11 | mode=cs1 | type = Unpublished report}}</ref> Maximum mean annual production on medium and poor sites was estimated at 7.0 m\u00b3/ha (100&nbsp;ft\u00b3/acre) and 3.5 m\u00b3/ha (50&nbsp;ft\u00b3/acre), respectively. An average water hickory site might realistically yield 210 m\u00b3/ha (3,000&nbsp;ft\u00b3/acre) at maturity. Slow growth and poor sites usually keep yields low.\n\n'''Rooting habit'''- Water hickory, like other hickories, grows a taproot in the seedling stage. The wet clayey soils where water hickory usually is found restricts the entire root system to fairly shallow depths. The taproot eventually becomes the source of a coarse, widespreading but shallow lateral root system. The taproot of a 30-cm (12-in) individual, excavated on moderately well-drained clayey soil, ended abruptly with three large lateral roots growing out at right angles. Only a few fine roots extended deeper than {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\n'''Reaction to competition'''- Water hickory is classed as intermediate in shade tolerance. Owing to its slow growth, poor quality, and consequent low value, most silvicultural operations are intended to favor species other than water hickory. Much \"high-grade\" logging has made the species more abundant and widespread than it would have been naturally. Water hickory responds well to release. On better drained sites, cutting or deadening all stems above {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in d.b.h. should relegate water hickory to a minor position in the future stand. Many seedlings and sprouts may emerge, but most of these are eventually overtopped by faster growing species. In the Overcup Oak-Water Hickory cover type, any kind of harvest will probably result in a major component of water hickory in the future stand. Water control projects that prolong spring flooding tend to favor water hickory.\n\n'''Damaging agents'''- Water hickory is occasionally damaged by insects. Of several borers that attack water hickory, the living-hickory borer, Goes pulcher, is the most common.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Solomon |first= James D. |year= 1974 |title= Biology and damage of the hickory borer, Goes pulcher, in hickory and pecan |journal= Annals of the Entomological Society of America |volume= 67 |issue= 2 |pages= 257\u2013260}}</ref> Borer attacks most often occur on young trees up to {{convert|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. Trunks weakened by tunnels sometimes break, and logs formerly infested by borers are of low value. Although this borer is widely distributed, damaging populations are rather local. Leaf-eating insects, especially the forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria, occasionally defoliate trees.\n\nDiseases are ordinarily unimportant to water hickory. Butt and stem rots entering through wounds from fire or logging can be a major source of cull. Heart-rot fungi tend to spread faster in the trunks of this species than in associated oaks and other bottom-land hardwoods.<ref>{{cite book |title= Diseases of forest and shade trees of the United States |last= Hepting |first= George H. |year= 1971 |publisher= U.S. Department of Agriculture |series= Agriculture Handbook 386 |location= Washington, DC. |page= 658}}</ref>\n\nThe major defect of water hickory is \"shake,\" found especially in trees on waterlogged sites; yellow-bellied sapsuckers also cause defects. Water hickory tends to support more mistletoe (Phoradendron serotinum) than any of its associated species.\n\n==Special uses==\nThe nuts of water hickory are used to a limited extent by squirrels, feral hogs, and other wildlife. Water hickory is occasionally planted or retained In natural stands for a shade tree.

The [[leaf|leaves]] are {{convert|15|-|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long, pinnate, with 7\u201311 leaflets, each leaflet lanceolate, {{convert|7|-|13|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long, with the apical leaflets the largest but only slightly so. The [[flower]]s are small wind-pollinated [[catkin]]s, produced in spring. The [[fruit]] is a very bitter [[nut (fruit)|nut]], {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long with a green four-valved cover which splits off at maturity in the fall, and a hard, bony shell. Another identifying characteristic is its bright sulfur-yellow winter bud.\n\nIt is closely related to the [[pecan]], sharing similar leaf shape and being classified in the same section of the genus ''Carya'' sect. ''Apocarya'', but unlike the pecan, it does not have edible nuts. It is most readily distinguished from the pecan by the smaller number of leaflets, with many leaves having only 7 leaflets (rarely fewer than 9, and often 11\u201313, in the pecan). [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrids]] with the pecan are known, and named ''Carya'' \u00d7 ''brownii''. A hybrid between the shagbark hickory (''C. ovata'') is also recognized, and is known as Laney's hickory (''Carya'' \u00d7''laneyi'').<ref>http://www.freefictionbooks.org/books/n/18194-northern-nut-growers-association-report-of-the-pro?start=97</ref>\n[[File:Carya cordiformis NRCS-1.jpg|thumb|right|Bitternut leaf]]\n\n== Habitat ==\n[[File:Carya cordiformis leaves.jpg|thumb|left|Branch of a bitternut hickory with developing nuts]]\nBitternut hickory grows in moist mountain valleys along streambanks and in swamps. Although it is usually found on wet bottom lands, it grows on dry sites and also grows well on poor soils low in nutrients. The species is not included as a titled species in the Society of American Foresters forest cover types because it does not grow in sufficient numbers.\n\n== Range ==\n[[File:Bitternutrangemap.jpg|thumb|left|US range map of ''Carya cordiformis'']]\n\nBitternut hickory grows throughout the eastern United States from southwestern New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and southern Quebec; west to southern Ontario, central Michigan, and northern Minnesota; south to eastern Texas; and east to northwestern Florida and Georgia. It is most common, however, from southern New England west to Iowa and from southern Michigan south to Kentucky. It is probably the most abundant and most uniformly distributed of all the hickories.\n\n== Uses ==\nBitternut is used for lumber and pulpwood. Because bitternut hickory wood is hard and durable, it is used for furniture, paneling, dowels, tool handles and ladders. Like other hickories, the [[wood]] is used for [[smoking (food)|smoking]] [[meat]], and by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for making [[bow (weapon)|bows]]. Bitternut hickory seeds and its bark are eaten by wildlife.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons and category-inline}}\n* {{Wikispecies-inline}}\n* [http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/caco15.htm ''Carya cordiformis'' images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu]*\n* [http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/ClimateChange/2ColumnSubPage/267031.html Ontario Tree Atlas: Bitternut Hickory (Carya Cordiformis)]\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Carya|cordiformis]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Hardwood forest plants]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]",

Other common names are '''pignut''', '''sweet pignut''', '''coast pignut hickory''', '''smoothbark hickory''', '''swamp hickory''', and '''broom hickory'''. The pear-shaped [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] ripens in September and October and is an important part of the diet of many wild animals. The [[wood]] is used for a variety of products, including fuel for home heating.\n\n==Habitat==\n\n===Native range===\nThe range of pignut hickory covers nearly all of eastern United States (11). The species grows in central [[Florida]] and westward through Louisiana and along the [[Gulf Coast]] to [[Alabama]] through [[Mississippi]]. It extends through parts of East [[Texas]] to [[Louisiana]], [[Arkansas]], [[Missouri]] and extreme southeastern [[Iowa]]. Its range further includes [[Massachusetts]] and the southwest corner of [[New Hampshire]] westward through southern [[Vermont]] to central [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan]] and [[Illinois]].\n\nThe best development of this species is in the lower [[Ohio River]] Basin. It prevails over other species of hickory in the [[Appalachia]]n forests. Pignut makes up much of the hickory harvested in [[Kentucky]], [[West Virginia]], the [[Cumberland Mountains]] of [[Tennessee]], and the hill country of the [[Ohio Valley]].\n\nPignut hickory is also found in Canada in southern [[Ontario]]. It does however have a limited range and is restricted to the [[Niagara Peninsula]], southern [[Halton Region]], the [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]\narea along western [[Lake Ontario]], and southward along the northern shore of [[Lake Erie]] and pockets of extreme southwestern Ontario.\n\n===Climate===\nPignut hickory grows in a [[humid]] [[climate]] with an average annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] of 760 to 2,030&nbsp;mm (30 to 80 in) of which 510 to 1,020&nbsp;mm (20 to 40 in) is [[rain]] during the growing season. Average [[snowfall]] varies from little to none in the South to 2,540&nbsp;mm (100&nbsp;in) or more in the mountains of [[West Virginia]], southeastern [[New York (state)|New York]], and southern [[Vermont]] (25).\n\nWithin the range of pignut hickory, [[average annual temperature]]s vary from 7&nbsp;\u00b0C (45&nbsp;\u00b0F) in the north to 21&nbsp;\u00b0C (70&nbsp;\u00b0F) in Florida. Average January temperature varies from -4\u00b0 to 16&nbsp;\u00b0C (25\u00b0 to 60&nbsp;\u00b0F) and average July temperature varies from 21\u00b0 to 27&nbsp;\u00b0C (70\u00b0 to 80&nbsp;\u00b0F). Extremes of 46\u00b0 and -30&nbsp;\u00b0C (115\u00b0 and -22&nbsp;\u00b0F) have been recorded within the range. The [[growing season]] varies by [[latitude]] and [[elevation]] from 140 to 300 days.\n\nMean annual [[relative humidity]] ranges from 70 to 80 percent with small monthly differences; daytime relative humidity often falls below 50% while nighttime humidity approaches 100%.\n\nMean annual [[Insolation|hours of sunshine]] range from 2,200 to 3,000. Average January sunshine varies from 100 to 200 hours, and July sunshine from 260 to 340 hours. Mean daily solar radiation ranges from 12.57 to 18.86 million J m\u00b1 (300 to 450 [[langley (unit)|langley]]s). In January daily radiation varies from 6.28 to 12.57 million J m\u00b1 (150 to 300 langleys), and in July from 20.95 to 23.04 million J m\u00b1 (500 to 550 langleys).\n\nAccording to one classification of climate (20), the range of pignut hickory south of the [[Ohio River]], except for a small area in Florida, is designated as humid, [[mesothermal]]. That part of the range lying north of the Ohio River is designated humid, mesothermal. Part of the species range in peninsular Florida is classed as subhumid, mesothermal. [[Mountain]]s in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee are classed as wet, [[microthermal]], and mountains in South Carolina and Georgia are classed as wet, mesothermal. Throughout its range, precipitation is rated adequate during all seasons.\n\n===Soils and topography===\nPignut hickory frequently grows on dry ridgetops and sideslopes throughout its range but it is also common on moist sites, particularly in the mountains and [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]]. In the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] pignut hickory has been observed on dry sandy soils at low elevations. Whittaker (27) placed pignut in a [[submesic]] class and charted it as ranging up to 1480 m (4,850&nbsp;ft)-the hickory with the greatest elevational range in the Great Smoky Mountains. In southwest Virginia, south-facing upper slopes from 975 to 1050 m (3,200 to 3,445&nbsp;ft) of [[Beanfield Mountain]] are dominated by pignut hickory, northern red oak ''[[Quercus rubra]]''), and white oak (''[[Quercus alba|Q. alba]]''). This site is the most xeric [[habitat]] on the mountain because of high [[insolation]], 70 percent slopes, and medium- to coarse-textured soils derived from [[Clinch sandstone]]. Mid-elevation slopes from 800 to 975 m (2,625 to 3,200&nbsp;ft) are dominated by chestnut oak (''[[Quercus prinus|Q. prinus]]''), northern red oak, and pignut hickory and coincide with three [[shale]] formations (12).\n\nThe range of pignut hickory encompasses 7 [[USDA soil taxonomy|orders]], 12 suborders, and 22 great groups of [[soil]]s (24,25). About two-thirds of the species range is dominated by [[Ultisols]], which are low in bases and have subsurface horizons of [[clay]] accumulation. They are usually moist but are dry during part of the warm season. [[Udults]] is the dominant suborder and [[Hapludults]] and [[Paleudults]] are the dominant great groups. These soils are derived from a variety of parent materials-[[sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rocks|metamorphic]] rocks, [[glacial till]], and in places varying thickness of [[loess]]-which vary in age from [[Precambrian]] to [[Quaternary]].\n\nA wide range of soil fertility exists as evidenced by soil orders-[[Alfisols]] and [[Mollisols]] which are medium to high in base saturation to Ultisols which are low in base saturation (24). Pignut hickory responds to increases in soil nitrogen similarly to American beech (''[[Fagus grandifolia]]''), sugar maple (''[[Acer saccharum]]''), and blackgum (''[[Nyssa sylvatica]]'') (15). These species are rated as intermediate in nitrogen deficiency tolerance and consequently are able to grow with lower levels of nitrogen than are required by \"nitrogen- demanding\" white ash (''[[Fraxinus americana]]''), yellow-poplar (''[[Liriodendron tulipifera]]''), and American basswood (''[[Tilia americana]]''). Hickories are considered \"soil improvers\" because their [[Leaf|leaves]] have a relatively high [[calcium]] content.\n\n===Associated forest cover===\nHickories are consistently present in the broad eastern upland [[Climax vegetation|climax]] forest association commonly called oak-hickory, but they are not generally abundant (18). Locally, hickories may make up to 20 to 30 percent of stand basal area, particularly in slope and cove forests below the [[escarpment]] of the [[Cumberland Plateau]] (23) and in second-growth forests in the [[Cumberland Mountains]], especially on [[Bench (geology)|benches]] (14). It has been hypothesized that hickory will replace chestnut (''[[Castanea dentata]]'') killed by the blight (''[[Cryphonectria parasitica]]'') in the [[Appalachia]]n Highlands (10,12). On [[Beanfield Mountain]] in [[Giles County, Virginia|Giles County]], [[Virginia]], the former chestnut-oak complex has changed to an oak-hickory association over a period of 50 years. This association is dominated by pignut hickory with an importance value of 41.0 (maximum value = 300), northern red oak (36.0), and chestnut oak (25.0). White oak, red maple (Acer rubrum), and sugar maple are subdominant species.\n\nPignut hickory is an associated species in 20 of the 90 forest cover types listed by the [[Society of American Foresters]] for the eastern United States (6):\n\n===Northern forest region===\n\n53 [[Pinus strobus|White Pine]]-[[Quercus prinus|Chestnut Oak]]\n\n===Central forest region===\n\n40 [[Quercus stellata|Post Oak]]-[[Quercus marilandica|Blackjack Oak]] <br/>\n44 [[Quercus prinus|Chestnut Oak]] <br/>\n45 [[Pinus rigida|Pitch Pine]] <br/>\n46 [[Juniperus virginiana|Eastern Redcedar]] <br/>\n52 [[Quercus alba|White Oak]]-[[Quercus velutina|Black Oak]]-[[Quercus rubra|Northern Red Oak]] <br/>\n53 White Oak <br/>\n55 Northern Red Oak <br/>\n57 [[Liriodendron tulipifera|Yellow-Poplar]]-[[Liriodendron|Tulip tree]] <br/>\n59 Yellow-Poplar-White Oak-Northern Red Oak <br/>\n64 [[Sassafras]]-[[Persimmon]] <br/>\n110 Black Oak\n\n===Southern forest region===\n\n75 [[Pinus echinata|Shortleaf Pine]] <br/>\n76 Shortleaf Pine-[[Oak]] <br/>\n78 [[Pinus virginiana|Virginia Pine]]-Oak <br/>\n79 Virginia Pine <br/>\n80 [[Pinus taeda|Loblolly Pine]]-[[Pinus echinata|Shortleaf Pine]] <br/>\n81 Loblolly Pine <br/>\n82 Loblolly Pine-[[Hardwood]] <br/>\n83 Longleaf Pine-[[Pinus elliottii|Slash Pine]]\n\nBecause the range of pignut hickory is so extensive, it is not feasible to list the associated [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, [[Herbaceous|herb]]s, and [[grass]]es, which vary according to [[elevation]], topographic conditions, [[edaphic]] features, and geographic locality.\n\n==Life history==\n[[Image:Pignut-hickory-nut.jpg|thumb|right|Pignut hickory nuts]]\n\n===Reproduction and early growth===\n[[Flowering]] and [[fruit]]ing- Hickories are [[monoecious]] and flower in the spring (3). The [[Stamen|staminate]] [[catkins]] of pignut hickory are 8 to 18&nbsp;cm (3 to 7 in) long and develop from [[axil]]s of leaves of the previous season or from inner scales of the terminal [[bud]]s at the base of the current growth. The [[pistil]]late flowers appear in [[Spike (botany)|spike]]s about 6&nbsp;mm (0.25&nbsp;in) long on [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]s terminating in shoots of the current year. Flowers open from the middle of March in the southeast part of the range to early June in [[New England]]. The catkins usually emerge before the pistillate flowers.\n\nThe [[fruit]] of hickory is [[pear]] shaped and enclosed in a thin husk developed from the floral [[Involucral bract|involucre]]. The fruit ripens in September and October, and [[seed]]s are dispersed from September through December. Husks are green until maturity; they turn brown to brownish-black as they ripen. The husks become dry at maturity and [[Dehiscence (botany)|split away]] from the [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] into four valves along sutures. Husks of pignut hickory split only to the middle or slightly beyond and generally cling to the nut, which is unribbed, with a thick shell.\n\n===Seed production and dissemination===\nPignut hickory begins to bear [[seed]] in quantity in 30 years, with optimum production between 75 and 200 years (16). The maximum age for seed production is about 300 years. Good seed crops occur every year or two with light crops in other years; [[frost]] can seriously hinder seed production (22). Usually less than half of the seeds are sound (2,3), but 50 to 75 percent of these will germinate. The hickory shuckworm (''Laspeyresia caryana'') can seriously reduce [[germination]]. Pignut seed, averaging 440/kg (200/lb), is lighter than the seed of other hickory species. The nuts are disseminated mainly by gravity, but the range of seeding is extended by [[squirrel]]s and [[chipmunk]]s.\n\n===Seedling development===\nHickories exhibit embryo dormancy which is overcome naturally by overwintering in the [[Forest floor|duff]] and [[Plant litter|litter]] or artificially by [[stratification (botany)|stratification]] in a moist medium at 1\u00b0 to 4&nbsp;\u00b0C (33\u00b0 to 40&nbsp;\u00b0F) for 30 to 150 days. In forest tree [[Nursery (horticulture)|nurseries]] unstratified hickory nuts are sown in the fall and stratified nuts are sown in the spring. Hickories are [[hypogeal germination|hypogeously]] germinating plants, and the nuts seldom remain viable in the forest floor for more than one winter (22).\n\nSeedling growth of hickories is slow. The following height growth of pignut hickory seedlings was reported in the Ohio Valley in the open or under light shade, on red [[clay]] soil (2):\n\n{|\n|-\n! Age\n! colspan=\"2\" | Height\n|-\n| (yr) || (cm) || (in)\n|-\n| 1    || 8    || 3.0\n|-\n| 2    || 15   || 5.8\n|-\n| 3    || 20   || 8.0\n|-\n| 4    || 30   || 12.0\n|-\n| 5    || 43   || 17.0\n|}\n\n===Vegetative reproduction===\nHickories sprout readily from [[stump (tree)|stump]]s and [[root]]s. Stump sprouting is not as prolific as in other [[deciduous]] trees species but the sprouts that are produced are vigorous and grow fairly rapidly in height. Root sprouts also are vigorous and probably more numerous than stump sprouts in cut-over areas. Small stumps sprout more frequently than large ones. Sprouts that originate at or below ground level and from small stumps are less likely to develop [[heartwood]] decay. Pignut hickory is difficult to reproduce from [[cutting (plant)|cutting]]s.\n\n===Sapling and pole stages to maturity===\nGrowth and yield- Pignut hickory often grows 24 to 27 m (80 to 90&nbsp;ft) tall and occasionally reaches 37&nbsp;m (120&nbsp;ft), with [[d.b.h.]] of 91 to 122&nbsp;cm (36 to 48 in). The [[bole (botany)|bole]] is often forked. Height and diameter by age are shown in table 1 for selected locations. Diameter growth of pignut hickory (along with [[chestnut oak]], [[white oak]], sweet birch (''[[Betula lenta]]''), and [[American beech]] is rated slow. Since hickories constitute 15 percent or less of the basal area of [[oak]]-hickory forest types, most growth and yield information is written in terms of oak rather than oak-hickory.

The taproot develops early, which may explain the slow growth of seedling shoots. Taproots may develop in compact and stony soils.\n\n===Reaction to competition===\nThe hickories as a group are classed as intermediate in shade tolerance; however, pignut hickory has been classed as intolerant in the Northeast and tolerant in the Southeast. In much of the area covered by mixed oak forests, shade-tolerant [[hardwood]]s (including the hickories) are [[Climax vegetation|climax]], and the trend of [[Ecological succession|succession]] toward this climax is very strong. Although most silvicultural systems when applied to oak types will maintain a hardwood forest, the cutting methods used affects the rapidity with which other species may replace the oaks and hickories (17,18,26).\n\n==Damaging agents==\nPignut hickory is easily damaged by [[Wildfire|fire]], which causes stem degrade or loss of volume, or both. Internal discolorations called mineral streak are common and are one major reason why so few standing hickories meet trade specifications. Streaks result from [[yellow-bellied sapsucker]] pecking, pin [[Wood knot|knot]]s, worm holes, and mechanical injuries. Hickories strongly resist ice damage and seldom develop epicormic branches.\n\nThe Index of Plant Diseases in the United States lists 133 [[fungi]] and 10 other causes of diseases on Carya species (4,9). Most of the fungi are [[saprophyte]]s, but a few are damaging to foliage, produce [[canker]]s, or cause [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] or [[root]] [[Dry rot|rot]]s.\n\nThe most common disease of pignut hickory from Pennsylvania southward is a trunk rot caused by ''Poria spiculosa''. Cankers vary in size and appearance depending on their age. A common form develops around a branch wound and resembles a swollen, nearly healed wound. On large trees these may become prominent [[burl]]-like bodies having several vertical or irregular folds in the callus covering. A single trunk canker near the base is a sign that the butt log is badly infected, and multiple cankers are evidence that the entire tree may be a cull.\n\nMajor leaf diseases are [[anthracnose]] (''Gnomonia caryae'') and [[mildew]] (''Microstroma juglandis''). The former causes brown spots with definite margins on the undersides of the leaf. These may coalesce and cause widespread blotching. Mildew invades the leaves and twigs and may form witches' brooms by stimulating bud formation. Although locally prevalent, mildew offers no problem in the management of hickory.\n\nThe stem [[canker]] (''Nectria galligena'') produces depressed areas with concentric [[bark]] rings that develop on the trunk and branches. Affected trees are sometimes eliminated through breakage or competition and sometimes live to reach merchantable size with cull section at the canker. No special control measures are required, but cankered trees should be harvested in stand improvement operations.\n\nA gall-forming fungus species of ''Phomopsis'' can produce warty excrescences ranging from small twig [[gall]]s to very large trunk [[burl]]s on northern hickories and oaks. Little information is available on root diseases of hickory.\n\nMore than 100 [[insect]]s have been reported to infest hickory trees and [[wood]] products, but only a few cause death or severe damage (1). The hickory [[bark beetle]] (''Scolytus quadrispinosus'') is the most important insect enemy of hickory, and also one of the most important insect pests of hardwoods in the Eastern United States. During [[drought]] periods in the Southeast, outbreaks often develop and large tracts of timber are killed. At other times, damage may be confined to the killing of a single tree or to portions of the tops of trees. The foliage of heavily infested trees turns red within a few weeks after attack, and the trees soon die. There is one generation per year in northern areas and normally two broods per year in the South. Control consists of felling infested trees and destroying the bark during winter months or storing infested logs in ponds.\n\nLogs and dying trees of several hardwood species including pignut hickory are attacked by the [[ambrosia beetle]] (''Platypus quadridentatus'') throughout the South and north to West Virginia and North Carolina. The [[Bostrichidae|false powderpost beetle]] (''Xylobiops basilaris'') attacks recently felled or dying trees, logs, or limbs with bark in the Eastern and Southern States. Hickory, persimmon (''[[Diospyros virginiana]]''), and pecan (''[[Carya illinoinensis|C. illinoinensis]]'') are most frequently infested, but other hardwoods also are attacked. Healthy trees growing in proximity to heavily infested trees are occasionally attacked but almost always without success. Hickory and persimmon wood (useful in the manufacture of small products such as [[shuttle block]]s, [[mallet]]s, and [[Splitting maul|mauls]] is sometimes seriously damaged.\n\nHickory is one of several host species of the [[Longhorn beetle|twig girdler]] (''Oncideres cingulata''). Infested trees and seedlings are not only damaged severely but become ragged and unattractive. A few of the more common species of gall-producing insects attacking hickory are ''[[Phylloxera]] caryaecaulis'', ''[[Caryomyia]] holotricha'', ''C. sanguinolenta'', and ''C. tubicola''.\n\n==Special uses==\nHickories provide food to many kinds of wildlife (8,13). The nuts are relished by several species of [[squirrel]] and represent an estimated 10 to 25 percent of their diet. Nuts and flowers are eaten by the [[wild turkey]] and several species of [[songbird]]s. Nuts and bark are eaten by [[American black bear|black bear]]s, [[fox]]es, [[rabbit]]s, and [[raccoon]]s. Small [[mammal]]s eat the nuts and leaves; 5 to 10 percent of the diet of eastern [[chipmunk]]s is hickory nuts. [[White-tailed deer]] occasionally browse hickory leaves, [[twig]]s, and nuts.\n\nThe kernel of hickory seeds is exceptionally high in crude [[fat]], up to 70 to 80 percent in some species. Crude [[protein]], [[phosphorus]], and [[calcium]] contents are generally moderate to low. Crude [[Dietary fiber|fiber]] is very low.\n\nPignut hickory makes up a small percentage of the [[biomass]] in low-quality upland hardwood stands that are prime candidates for [[clearcutting]] for chips or fuelwood as the first step toward rehabilitation to more productive stands. Hickory has a relatively high heating value and is used extensively as a home heating fuel.\n\nPignut hickory is an important [[shade tree]] in wooded [[suburban]] areas over most of the range but is seldom planted as an [[ornamental tree]] because of its size and difficulty of transplanting, although it has spectacular orangey-red fall colors.\n\n==Genetics==\n''Carya glabra'' var. ''megacarpa'' (Sarg.) Sarg., coast pignut hickory, was once recognized as a distinct variety but is now considered to be a synonym of ''C. glabra'' (Mill.) Sweet. ''C. leiodermis'' Sarg., swamp hickory, has also been added as a synonym of ''C. glabra'' (11).\n\n''Carya glabra'' (Mill.) Sweet var. ''glabra'' distinguishes the (typical) pignut hickory from red hickory (''C. glabra'' var. ''odorata'' (Marsh.) Little). The [[taxonomic]] position of red hickory is controversial. The binomial ''C. ovalis'' (Wangenh.) Sarg. was published in 1913 for a segregate of ''C. glabra''. It was reduced to a [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of ''C. glabra'' in Little's 1953 checklist but was elevated to a [[Variety (botany)|variety]] in the 1979 edition (11). The principal difference is in the husk of the [[fruit]], opening late and only partly, or remaining closed in ''C. glabra'' but promptly [[Dehiscence (botany)|splitting]] to the base in C. ovalis. However, many trees are intermediate in this trait, and the recorded ranges are almost the same. The leaves of ''C. ovalis'' have mostly seven leaflets; those of ''C. glabra'' have mostly five leaflets. The two can be distinguished with certainty only in November. Since the two ranges seem to overlap, the distributions have been mapped together as a Carya glabra-ovalis complex (11).\n\n''Carya ovalis'' has also been treated as an interspecific hybrid between ''C. glabra'' and ''C. ovata''. ''C. ovalis'' was accepted as a polymorphic species especially variable in the size and shape of its nuts and possibly a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]. The relationships may be more complex after a long and reticulate [[phylogeny]], according to detailed [[chemical]] analyses of hickory nut oils.\n\nOne hybrid, ''C.'' x ''demareei'' Palmer (''C. glabra'' x ''cordiformis'') was described in 1937 from northeastern [[Arkansas]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Carya glabra}}\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n#Baker, Whiteford L. 1972.

It is a slow-growing, long-lived tree, hard to transplant because of its long taproot, and subject to insect damage. The nuts, largest of all hickory nuts, are sweet and edible. Wildlife and people harvest most of them; those remaining produce seedling trees readily. The wood is hard, heavy, strong, and very flexible, making it a favored wood for tool handles. A specimen tree has been reported in Missouri with {{convert|117|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} [[diameter at breast height]], {{convert|36.9|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, and a spread of {{convert|22.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Habitat ==\n=== Native range ===\nShellbark hickory is widely distributed, but is nowhere common. The range extends from western New York through southern Michigan to southeast Iowa, south through eastern Kansas into northern Oklahoma, and eastward through Tennessee into Pennsylvania. This species is most prominent in the lower Ohio River region and south along the Mississippi River to central Arkansas. It is frequently found in the great river swamps of central Missouri and the Wabash River region in Indiana and Ohio.\n\nIn part due to man's activities, shellbark hickory has become rare in its natural range. The heavy seeds do not travel far from the parent tree and many stands have been lost to forest clearing and lumber harvesting. It is also not planted much as an ornamental due to its slow growth and difficulty of transplanting.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe mean length of the frost-free period within the range of shellbark hickory is from 150 to 210 days. The average January temperature is between {{convert|-4|and|5|C|F}}, and for July the mean temperature is from {{convert|23|to|27|C|F}}. An average minimum temperature of {{convert|-26|C|F}} occurs in the northern part of the range, and an average maximum temperature of {{convert|38|C|F}} is found throughout the range. Precipitation varies between {{convert|750|and|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year including {{convert|15|to|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} of snow.\n\n=== Soils and topography ===\nShellbark hickory grows best on deep, fertile, moist soils, most typical of the order Alfisols. It does not thrive in heavy clay soils, but grows well on heavy loams or silt loams. Shellbark hickory requires moister situations than do pignut, mockernut, or shagbark hickories (''Carya glabra, C. alba,'' or ''C. ovata''), although it is sometimes found on dry, sandy soils. Specific nutrient requirements are not known, but generally the hickories grow best on neutral or slightly alkaline soils.\n\nThe species is essentially a bottomland species and is often found on river terraces and second bottoms. Land subject to shallow inundations for a few weeks early in the growing season is favorable for shellbark. However, the tree will grow on a wide range of topographic and physiographic sites.\n\n=== Associated forest cover ===\nShellbark hickory may be found in pure groups of several trees but is more frequent singly in association with other hardwoods. The species is a minor component of the forest cover types bur oak (Society of American Foresters type 42), [[pin oak\u2013sweetgum]] (type 65), and [[swamp chestnut oak\u2013cherrybark oak]] (type 91). It may also be found in one or more of the types in which hickories are included, but it is not identified at the species level.\n\nShellbark hickory commonly grows in association with [[American elm|American]] (''Ulmus americana''), [[slippery elm|slippery]] (''U. rubra''), and [[winged elm]]s (''U. alata''), [[white ash|white]] (''Fraxinus americana'') and [[green ash]] (''F. pennsylvanica''), [[American basswood|basswood]] (''Tilia americana''), [[American hornbeam]] (''Carpinus caroliniana''), [[red maple]] (''Acer rubrum''), [[blackgum]] (''Nyssa sylvatica''), [[American sweetgum|sweetgum]] (''Liquidambar styraciflua''), and [[Eastern cottonwood|cottonwood]] (''Populus deltoides''). It is found in association with four other hickories\u2013[[shagbark hickory|shagbark]], [[mockernut hickory|mockernut]], [[bitternut hickory|bitternut]] (''Carya cordiformis''), and [[water hickory|water]] (''C. aquatica''), and numerous oak species, including [[swamp white oak|swamp white]] (''Quercus bicolor''), [[pin oak|pin]] (''Q. palustris''), [[Quercus alba|white]] (''Q. alba''), [[Shumard oak|Shumard]] (''Q. shumardii''), [[water oak|water]] (''Q. nigra''), [[Delta post oak|Delta post]] (''Q. stellata'' var. ''paludosa''), [[swamp chestnut oak|swamp chestnut]] (''Q. michauxii''), and [[Nuttall oak|Nuttall]] (''Q. nuttallii'').\n\nThe herbaceous stratum includes numerous sedges and grasses. The shrub and small [[tree layer]] may be composed of [[painted buckeye]] (''Aesculus sylvatica''), [[common pawpaw|pawpaw]] (''Asimina triloba''), [[flowering dogwood]] (''Cornus florida''), [[eastern redbud]] (''Cercis canadensis''), [[possumhaw]] (''Ilex decidua''), [[poison ivy]] (''Toxicodendron radicans''), and [[trumpet-creeper]] (''Campsis radicans'').\n\n== Life history ==\n=== Sapling and pole stages to maturity ===\nGrowth and yield: The hickories as a group grow slowly in diameter, and shellbark hickory is no exception. Sapling size trees average {{convert|2|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} per year in diameter growth, increasing to {{convert|3|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} per year as poles and sawtimber. Second-growth trees show growth rates of {{convert|5|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} per year. Shellbark hickory occasionally grows to a height of {{convert|40|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} and a diameter of {{convert|100|cm|in|0}}.\n\nRooting habit: Shellbark hickory develops a large taproot that penetrates deeply into the soil. Lateral roots emerge at nearly right angles to the taproot, spreading horizontally through the soil. Major distinct lateral roots usually develop 12 inches or more below ground level and appear only after taproot is well formed. In Illinois, root growth was rapid in April, slowed during July and August, increased again in September, and ended in late November.\n\nMycorrhizal associations are formed when trees are young. The only specific fungus identified from shellbark hickory roots is an ectotrophic mycorrhiza,'' [[Laccaria ochropurpurea]]''.\n\nReaction to competition: Shellbark hickory is very shade-tolerant, exceeded only by [[sugar maple]] (''Acer saccharum'') and [[American beech|beech]] (''Fagus grandifolia''). It grows slowly under a dense canopy, however. In stands with only partial shade, it reproduces well. It is a very strong competitor in most of the species associations in which it is found.\n\nUnder forest conditions, shellbark hickory often develops a clear bole for half its length and has a narrow, oblong crown. Open-grown trees have egg-shaped crowns.<ref>Merz, Robert W. 1965. Shellbark hickory (Carya laciniosa (Michx. f.) Loud.). In Silvics of forest trees of the United States. p. 132-135. H. A. Fowells, comp. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Handbook 27 1. Washington, DC.</ref>  Heavy release sometimes results in epicormic branching.\n\nDamaging agents: Although numerous insects and diseases affect hickories, shellbark hickory has no enemies that seriously threaten its development or perpetuation as a species. Seed production can be reduced significantly, however, through attack by several insects. Two of the most important are the pecan weevil (''Curculio caryae'') and the hickory shuckworm (''[[Laspeyresia caryana]]'').\n\nThe hickory bark beetle (''[[Scolytus quadrispinosus]]'') feeds in the cambium and seriously weakens or even kills some trees. Adults of the hickory spiral borer (''[[Agrilus arcuatus]] torquatus'') feed on leaves, but the larvae feed beneath the bark and can be very destructive to hickory seedlings. The flatheaded appletree borer (''[[Chrysobothris femorata]]'') likewise is a foliage-feeder as an adult, but its larvae feed on the phloem and outer sapwood.\n\nThe living-hickory borer (''[[Goes pulcher]]'') feeds in the trunks and branches of trees. A twig girdler (''[[Oncideres cingulata]]'') can seriously affect reproduction by killing back the tops of seedlings and sprouts. Both standing dead trees and freshly cut logs are highly susceptible to attacks by numerous species of wood borers.\n\nA large number of insect species feed on hickory foliage. None of them causes serious problems for shellbark hickory, although they may be responsible for some stem deformity and growth loss.<ref>Baker, Whiteford L. 1976. Eastern forest insects. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Miscellaneous Publication 1175. Washington, DC. 642 p.</ref>\n\nShellbark hickory is free of serious diseases, but it is a host species for a variety of fungi. More than 130 fungi have been identified from species of ''Carya''. These include leaf disease, stem canker, wood rot, and root rot-causing fungi. Specific information for shellbark hickory is not available.<ref>Hepting, George H. 1971. Diseases of forest and shade trees of the United States. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Handbook 386. Washington, DC. 658 p.</ref>\n\nShellbark hickory is susceptible to bole injury from fire, and fire injuries are often invaded by wood rot fungi. It is resistant to snow and ice damage, but is susceptible to frost damage.\n\n== Special uses ==\nShellbark hickory nuts are used for food by ducks, quail, wild turkeys, squirrels, chipmunks, deer, foxes, raccoons, and white-footed mice. A few plantations of shellbark hickory have been established for nut production, but the nuts are difficult to crack, though the kernel is sweet. The wood is used for furniture, tool handles, sporting goods, veneer, fuelwood, charcoal, and drum sticks.\n\n== Genetics ==\nShellbark hickory hybridizes with the [[pecan]], ''Carya illinoensis'' (''C.'' x ''nussbaumeri'' Sarg.), and shagbark hickory,'' C. ovata'' (''C.'' x'' dunbarii'' Sarg.). Shellbark hickory has 32 chromosomes. In general, species within the genus with the same chromosome number are able to cross. Numerous hybrids among the'' Carya'' species with 32 chromosomes (pecan, [[Carya cordiformis|bitternut]], shellbark, and [[Carya ovata|shagbark]]) have been described.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Bonner, F.

Little is known of the growth rate of nutmeg hickory. Logs and lumber are sold mixed with other hickories. The nuts are an oil-rich food for wildlife.\n\n==Habitat==\n\n===Native range===\nNutmeg hickory is the rarest species in the genus, occurring in a few areas scattered in southeastern [[North Carolina]], eastern [[South Carolina]], central [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]], northern [[Louisiana]], southern [[Arkansas]], eastern [[Texas]], and northeastern Mexico. The species is typically found in river bottomlands with [[calcareous soil]] or [[marl]] ridges.<ref>Stone, Donald E. 1997. [http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233500319 \"Carya myristiciformis\"]. In Flora of North America, vol. 3, Oxford University Press, New York, pp. 420-421. Accessed June 2, 2008</ref> The species is abundant only near [[Selma, Alabama]], and in southern Arkansas. Nutmeg hickory has a native range nearly identical with that of Durand Oak (''Q. durandii'' var. ''durandii''). Both may be relics of a more ancient flora than now occupies the region.<ref name=Maisenhelder>{{cite book|author=Maisenhelder, Louis C. |year=1965 |chapter=Nutmeg hickory (''Carya myristicaeformis'' (Michx. f.) Nutt.) |title=Silvics of forest trees of the United States |pages=119\u2013120 |editor=H. A. Fowells (ed.) |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture |series=Agriculture Handbook 271 |location=Washington, DC.}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nPrecipitation within the range of nutmeg hickory varies from 1020 to 1400&nbsp;mm (40 to 55 in) per year, 510&nbsp;mm (20&nbsp;in) or more falling during the growing season. The frost-free period of most of the native range is about 240 days. Summers are warm and dry in the western portion of the range, but warm and wet in the South Carolina disjuncts. July temperatures average about 27\u00b0C (80\u00b0F). January temperatures average between 7\u00b0 and 10\u00b0C (45\u00b0 and 50\u00b0F). Extremes of temperature are -23\u00b0 to 43\u00b0C (-10\u00b0 to 110\u00b0F).\n\n===Soils and topography===\nNutmeg hickory grows on a variety of loamy, silty, or clayey soils that may be described as moist, but well or moderately well drained and amply supplied with mineral nutrients. The species most often is found in minor stream bottoms, on second bottom flats, and on slopes or bluffs near streams. The principal soils on which nutmeg hickory is generally found are in the orders [[Alfisol]]s and [[Inceptisol]]s.\n\n===Associated forest cover===\nNutmeg hickory is not an important species in any forest cover type and is only a minor associate in Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak ([[Society of American Foresters]] Type 91).<ref>Eyre, F. H., ed. 1980. Forest cover types of the United States and Canada. Society of American Foresters, Washington, DC. 148 p.</ref> Other prominent associates in this type include [[white ash]] (''Fraxinus americana''); [[Carya ovata|shagbark hickory]](''Carya ovata''), [[Carya laciniosa|shellbark hickory]](''Carya laciniosa''), [[Carya tomentosa|mockernut hickory]](''C. tomentosa''), and [[Carya cordiformis|bitternut hickory]] (''Carya cordiformis''); [[Shumard oak]] (''Quercus shumardii''); and [[blackgum]] (''Nyssa sylvatica''). Less important associates are [[willow oak]](''Quercus phellos''), [[water oak]](''Qercus nigra''), and [[Oak|Durand oaks]] (''Quercus durandii''); [[American elm]] (''Ulmus americana'') and [[Ulmus alata|winged elms]] (''Ulmus alata''); [[yellow-poplar]] (''Liriodendron tulipifera''); and [[American beech]] (''Fagus grandifolia''). Some common small trees and shrubs occurring with nutmeg hickory are [[Hophornbeam|eastern hophornbeam]] (''Ostrya uirginiana''), [[American hornbeam]] (''Carpinus caroliniana''), [[flowering dogwood]] (''Cornus florida''), and [[oakleaf hydrangea]] (''Hydrangea quercifolia''). One survey near [[Charleston, SC]], found [[red buckeye]] (''Aesculus pavia''), [[eastern redbud]] (''Cercis canadensis''), and [[witch-hazel]] (''Hamamelis virginiana'') associated with nutmeg hickory.<ref name=Maisenhelder/>\n\n==Life history==\n\n===Reproduction and early growth===\n\nThe species is [[monoecious]] and forms imperfect flowers. Both male and female flowers are found on the current year's growth. The male flowers are long-stalked [[catkin]]s, developing at the shoot base.<ref>Sargent, Charles Sprague. 1965. Manual of the trees of North America. vol. 1. Dover, New York. (Reprint of 1926 revision, Houghton Mifflin, New York.) 934 p.</ref> The female flowers are in short spikes on [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncles]] at the end of the shoot. Flowering occurs from April to May, shortly after the leaves have started to open. Specifies of pollen production, dissemination and pollination are not known. The sweet, edible nut matures from September to October of the same year and falls between September and December. Its ellipsoidal shell is thick and hard.\n\nSeed production starts when the trees are about 30 years old, and optimum seed-bearing age is 50 to 125 years.<ref name=Maisenhelder/> Good seed crops are produced every 2 to 3 years. As many as 70 liters (2 bu) can be produced by an open-grown tree. Seeds are disseminated by various methods, including squirrels and water.\n\nThe seeds of this species germinate from late April to early June. Germination is [[hypogeal germination|hypogeal]]. Burial of seeds by squirrels seems to be important, but it is not necessary for the successful establishment of seedlings.\n\nSpecific information on the vegetative reproduction of nutmeg hickory is not available. Like other hickories, it probably sprouts readily from small stumps, injured or top-killed seedlings and saplings, and from roots.<ref>Boisen, Anton T., and J. A. Newlin. 1910. The commercial hickories. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bulletin 80. Washington, DC. 64 p.</ref>  Large stumps do not readily sprout, hence the larger the stump, the more likely that it will reproduce only by root suckers.\n\n===Sapling and pole stages to maturity===\nNutmeg hickory is a medium-sized tree with a tall, straight trunk and stout, slightly spreading branches that form a narrow and rather open crown. It can attain heights of 24 to 30 in (80 to 100&nbsp;ft) and a diameter of 61&nbsp;cm (24&nbsp;in).\n\nAlthough the pecan hickories (which include nutmeg hickory) grow more rapidly than the true hickories,<ref>Nelson, Thomas C. 1965. Silvical characteristics of the commercial hickories. USDA Forest Service, Hickory Task Force Report 10. Southeastern Forest Experiment Station, Asheville, NC. 16 p.</ref> specific information on the growth rate of nutmeg hickory is lacking. The pecan hickories, in turn, grow more slowly than most other bottom-land hardwoods. The average 10-year diameter increase for hickories in natural, unmanaged stands in the northeast Louisiana delta was 4.3&nbsp;cm (1.7&nbsp;in) in the 15- to 30-cm (6- to 12-in) diameter class; 3.3&nbsp;cm (1.3&nbsp;in) in the 33- to 48-cm (13- to 19-in) diameter class; and 3.8&nbsp;cm (1.5&nbsp;in) in the 51- to 71-cm (20- to 28-in) diameter class.<ref name=Maisenhelder/>\n\nPure stands of nutmeg hickory probably do not exist, and no volume figures are available. Logs and lumber from merchantable nutmeg hickory are sold mixed with other hickories. \n\nRooting Habit- Nutmeg hickory has a strongly developed taproot, especially on well-drained soil. Seedlings of hickory quickly develop a heavy taproot and fine lateral roots. During the pole stage, a robust, spreading lateral root system is developed.\n\nNutmeg hickory is classed as intolerant of shade. It is intolerant as a mature tree, but tolerant in the seedling and sapling stage during which it may survive for a long time in the understory and then respond to release.<ref name=Maisenhelder/> Any partial cutting system that removes larger, faster-growing competition encourages nutmeg hickory.\n\nFire damages hickory of all ages. A light burn kills the tops of seedlings and saplings; a more intense fire wounds larger trees and provides entry for [[butt-rotting fungus|butt-rotting fungi]].\n\nSeveral insects attack hickory but rarely become epidemic.<ref>Baker, Whiteford L. 1972. Eastern forest insects. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Miscellaneous Publication 1175. Washington, DC. 642 p.</ref> The [[Malacosoma disstria|forest tent caterpillar]] (''Malacosoma disstria''), [[Datana|walnut caterpillar]] (''Datana integerima''), and [[Diapheromera femorata|walkingstick]] (''Diapheromera femorata'') may defoliate individual trees or limbs. Sucking insects, including [[aphid]]s (Monellia spp.), feed on the underside of leaves, causing them to curl and drop prematurely. The [[Oncideres cingulata|twig girdler]] (''Oncideres cingulata'') may seriously prune seedlings and even large trees by girdling the terminal and branches. The [[Scolytus quadrispinosus|hickory bark beetle]] (''Scolytus quadrispinosus'') can be troublesome during dry years and periods of stress.\n\nThe [[ambrosia beetle]] (Platypus spp. and Xyleborus spp.) and [[powderpost beetle]]s (Lyctus spp. and Xylobiops basilaris) often cause economic damage to logs and lumber during storage and air-drying.\n\nNo important diseases of hickory other than a number of wood rots have been reported. Bird peck defect, caused by the [[yellow-bellied sapsucker]], is common and serious in nutmeg hickory.\n\n==Special uses==\nThe nuts of nutmeg hickory are relished by squirrels, which begin cutting them while they are still green.<ref>Halls, Lowell K. 1977. Southern fruit-producing woody plants used by wildlife. USDA Forest Service, General Technical Report SO-16. Southern Forest Experiment Station, New Orleans, LA. 235 p.</ref> Other rodents and wildlife also eat the nuts. The species is too rare over most of its range to be of major economic importance. The wood of this pecan hickory is slightly inferior in strength and toughness to that of the true or upland hickories, but owing to the small volumes involved and difficulty of distinguishing it from the true hickories, nutmeg hickory is not separated from them during logging.\n\n==Genetics==\nNo racial varieties or hybrids have been reported for nutmeg hickory.\n\n==Literature cited==\n{{wikispecies|Carya myristiciformis}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{USGovernment|sourceURL=[http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/table_of_contents.shtm Silvics of North America; volume 2: Hardwoods], [[United States Department of Agriculture]] [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]]}}\n\n[[Category:Carya|myristiciformis]]\n[[Category:Edible nuts and seeds]]\n[[Category:Crops originating from the United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]",

It is typically found growing in dry, well drained sandy upland ridges and sloped woodlands from southern [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], and in the [[United States]] east to [[New Hampshire]], south to northern [[Florida]] west to eastern [[Texas]] and north-west to [[Nebraska]].<ref>USDA Germplasm Resources Information Network: [http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?402991 ''Carya ovalis'']</ref> This species was formerly treated as a variety or northern [[ecotype]] of the [[pignut hickory]] ''C. glabra'', described as ''Carya glabra'' var. ''odorata''. This discrepancy has not yet been completely resolved, and some sources and authors still consider red hickory as a variety or synonym of pignut hickory.<ref>Flora of North America: [http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233500317 ''Carya glabra'']</ref> However both trees are quite morphologically distinct.\n\n== Description ==\nThe red hickory is generally encountered as a medium-sized [[tree]], capable of growing to {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in height.<ref>Plants For A Future: [http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Carya+ovalis ''Carya ovalis'']</ref> The single [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] is straight and often continues for the entire height of the tree, although sometimes splits into several large limbs once the canopy has been breached. The [[branch]]es are strong, stout and long, ascending in the upper [[Crown (botany)|crown]] and drooping in the lower crown; the branches around mid-height are more or less horizontal. This creates a broad, thick, column-shaped form that casts dense shade. Individuals have been known to live from 100\u2013250 years of age.\n\n[[File:RedHickoryNuts.jpg||thumb|left||the thin shelled nuts of red hickory]]\nThe [[leaves]] are pinnately [[Compound leaves|compound]], typically producing 5-9 [[leaflet (botany)|leaflets]] (7 being the most common). The [[terminal leaflet]] is often the largest, with the auxiliary leaflets decreasing in size from the tip to the base of the [[rachis]]. Leaflets are broadest above or at their [[median]] length, with finely [[Serrate (botany)|serrated]] margins. They are dark green and smooth or [[glaucous]] above and paler and finely [[Leaf#Surface|pubescent]] underneath. the rachis of the leaves are usually bright red or purple in color, a distinctive feature of red hickory that helps to separate it from pignut hickory.<ref name=Ohio>Ohio Trees Bulletin 700-00: [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090708064229/http://ohioline.osu.edu/b700/b700_23.html ''Carya'' \u2013 Hickory]</ref>\n\n[[File:RedHickoryBark.jpg||thumb|left||The bark of a mature red hickory]]The [[bark]] of mature trees is grey, composed of tight, flat-topped intersecting ridges that can appear quite blocky but are generally strap-like. Occasionally, the ridges may separate from the trunk in peeling strips, loose at both ends, a trait characteristic of [[Carya ovata|Shagbark]] and [[Carya laciniosa|Shellbark Hickories]]. Young, vigorously growing trees are more prone to producing peeling bark than mature individuals.\n\nLike all hickories, the fruit is a small round or slightly elliptical [[nut (fruit)|nut]], born singly or in groups of 2-3 on the ends of bearing branches. When immature, the nut is encased in a thin, green [[husk]] with 4 distinct seams. Upon maturity (late September to mid-October) the husk changes from being green, fleshy and flexible to dark brown and very brittle. The seams then split from the base upwards and may or may not completely separate from the ripe nut. The nut itself is smooth, tan to beige in color and has 4 shallow ridges from the seams. The inner [[seed|kernel]] is very oily and varies in flavor from bitter and unpalatable to mildly sweet. For such as small nut, the shell is thick and the kernel difficult to extract. These nuts are relished by countless wildlife species, including many [[rodents]] and [[birds]], as well as [[raccoon]]s and [[wild turkey]]s.\n\nThe [[flowers]] emerge in the spring at the same times as the developing leaves (early to late May). The male flowers are long, green, inconspicuous drooping [[catkin]]s that develop between the base of the petiole and the developing twig. The female flowers are bizarre looking, with a tuft of sticky green tissue emerging from a swollen base. These develop individually or in groups at the end of a new twig, after the expanding leaves. All hickories are self-infertile and [[monoecious]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Carya|ovalis]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Canada]]",

It is a large, [[deciduous]] [[tree]], growing well over  {{convert|100|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall, and will live more than 350<ref>http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~adk/oldlisteast/#spp</ref> years. The tallest measured shagbark, located in Savage Gulf, Tennessee, is over {{convert|150|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall.  Mature shagbarks are easy to recognize because, as their name implies, they have shaggy bark. This characteristic is, however, only found on mature trees; young specimens have smooth bark.\n\nThe shagbark hickory's nut is edible and has a very sweet taste.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are {{convert|30|-|60|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long, [[pinnate]], with five (rarely three or seven) leaflets, the terminal three leaflets much larger than the basal pair. The shagbark hickory is [[monoecious]]. Staminate flowers are borne on long-stalked [[catkins]] at the tip of old wood or in the axils of the previous season's leaves.

They are unsuitable to commercial or orchard production due to the long time it takes for a tree to produce sizable crops and unpredictable output from year to year. Shagbark hickories can grow to enormous sizes but are unreliable bearers. The nuts can be used as a substitute for the [[pecan]] in colder climates and have nearly the same culinary function.\n\n''C. ovata'' begins producing seeds at about 10 years of age, but large quantities are not produced until 40 years and will continue for at least 100. Nut production is erratic, with good crops every 3 to 5 years, in between which few or none appear and the entire crop may be lost to animal predation.\n\n[[Andrew Jackson]], the seventh president of the United States, was popularly nicknamed Old Hickory, a play on the toughness of hickory wood. In 1830, he began planning the construction of his tomb at [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]], his plantation in [[Tennessee]]. The grave site was surrounded by a variety of trees, including six shagbark hickories. They stood there for 168 years until a storm in 1998 demolished over 1,200 trees at the site. Work on replanting them remains an ongoing project. In modern times, shagbark hickory is rarely used as an ornamental due to its large size, slow growth, difficulty of transplanting (all Juglandacaea species have large taproots) and nut litter.\n\n\"Hickory\" is derived from ''pawcohiccora'', an Algonquian Indian word for the tree's oily nutmeat.\n<ref name=Hilton />  The nuts were a food source for Native Americans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/carya/species/ovata/ovata.htm |last=Grauke |first=LJ |publisher=Texas A&M University, Department of Horticultural Science |title=Hickories: ''Carya ovata''|accessdate=2013-08-10}}</ref>\n\nShagbark hickory [[wood]] is used for [[smoking (food)|smoking]] [[meat]] and for making the [[bow (weapon)|bows]] of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of the northern area.

''x'' dunbarii'' Sarg.). Shagbark hickory has 32 chromosomes. In general, species within the genus with the same chromosome number are able to cross. Numerous hybrids among the ''Carya'' species with 32 chromosomes (pecan, [[Carya cordiformis|bitternut]], [[Carya laciniosa|shellbark]], and shagbark) have been described, though most are unproductive or have other flaws.

The most abundant of the [[Carya|hickories]], common in the eastern half of the [[United States|US]], it is long lived, sometimes reaching the age of 500 years. A straight-growing hickory, a high percentage of its wood is used for products where strength, hardness, and flexibility are needed. The wood makes an excellent fuelwood, as well.\n\nThe species\u2019 name comes from the Latin word ''tomentum'', meaning \"covered with dense short hairs,\" referring to the underside of the leaves which help identify the species. Also called the white hickory due to the light color of the wood, the common name mockernut comes from the large, thick-shelled fruit with very small kernels of meat inside.<ref name=\"Miller\" />\n\n==Habitat==\n\n===Native range===\nMockernut hickory, a true hickory, grows from Massachusetts and New York west to southern Ontario, southern Michigan, and northern Illinois; then to southeastern Iowa, Missouri, and eastern Kansas, south to eastern Texas and east to northern Florida.

Within its range the mean annual precipitation measures from {{convert|890|mm|in}} in the north to {{convert|2030|mm|in}} in the south. During the growing season (April through September), annual precipitation varies from {{convert|510|to|890|mm|in|abbr=on}}. About {{convert|200|cm|in}} of annual snowfall is common in the northern part of the range, but it seldom snows in the southern portion.\n\nAnnual temperatures range from 10\u00b0 to 21&nbsp;\u00b0C (50\u00b0 to 70&nbsp;\u00b0F). Temperatures range from 21\u00b0 to 27' C (70\u00b0 to 80&nbsp;\u00b0F) in July and from -7\u00b0 to 16&nbsp;\u00b0C (20\u00b0 to 60&nbsp;\u00b0F) in January. Temperature extremes are well above {{convert|38|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and below {{convert|-18|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The growing season is approximately 160 days in the northern part of the range and up to 320 days in the southern part of the range.<ref name=\"USDA 1941\">U.S. Department of Agriculture. 1941.

Washington, DC 754 p.</ref> These soils are low in nutrients and usually moist, but during the warm season, they are dry part of the time. Along the mid-Atlantic and in the southern and western range, mockernut hickory grows on a variety of soils on slopes of 25 percent or less, including combinations of fine to coarse [[loam]]s, clays, and well-drained quartz sands. On slopes steeper than 25 percent, mockernut often grows on coarse loams.\n\nMockernut grows on [[Inceptisol]]s in an estimated 15 percent of its range. These clayey soils are moderate to high in nutrients and are primarily in the Appalachians on gentle to moderate slopes where water is available to plants during the growing season. In the northern Appalachians on slopes of 25 percent or less, mockernut hickory grows on poorly drained loams with a [[fragipan]]. In the central and southern Appalachians on slopes 25 percent or less, mockernut hickory grows on fine loams. On steeper slopes it grows on coarse loams.<ref name=\"USDA 1975\" />\n\nIn the northwestern part of the range, mockernut grows on [[mollisol]]s. These soils have a deep, fertile surface horizon greater than {{convert|25|cm|in}} thick. Mollisols characteristically form under grass in climates with moderate to high seasonal precipitation.\n\nMockernut grows on a variety of soils including wet, fine loams, sandy textured soils that often have been burned, plowed, and pastured. [[Alfisol]]s are also present in these areas and contain a medium to high supply of nutrients. Water is available to plants more than half the year or more than 3 consecutive months during the growing season. On slopes 25 percent or less, mockernut grows on wet to moist, fine loam soils with a high carbonate content.<ref name=\"USDA 1975\" />\n\n==Associated forest cover==\nMockernut hickory is associated with the eastern [[Oak-hickory forest]] and the [[beech-maple forest]]. The species does not exist in sufficient amounts to be included as a title species in the [[Society of American Foresters]] forest cover types. Nevertheless, it is identified as an associated species in eight cover types. Three of the upland oak types and the bottom land type are subclimax to [[climax vegetation|climax]]. The types are:\n\nCentral Forest Region (upland oaks)-Post Oak-Blackjack Oak (Type 40), White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak (Type 52), White Oak (Type 53), Black Oak (Type 110).\n\nSouthern Forest Region (southern yellow pines) Shortleaf Pine (Type 75), Loblolly Pine-Shortleaf Pine (Type 80); (oak-pine type) Loblolly Pine-Hardwood (Type 82); (bottom-land type) Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak (Type 91).\n\n===In the central forest upland oak types, mockernut is commonly associated with===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[pignut hickory]] (''Carya glabra'')\n* [[shagbark hickory]] (''C. ovata'')\n* [[bitternut hickory]] (''C. cordiformis'')\n* [[Quercus velutina|black oak]] (''Quercus velutina'')\n* [[scarlet oak]] (''Q. coccinea'')\n* [[post oak]] (''Q. stellata'')\n* [[bur oak]] (''Q. macrocarpa'')\n* [[blackgum]] (''Nyssa sylvatica'')\n* [[yellow-poplar]] (''Liriodendron tulipifera'')\n* [[maple]]s (''Acer'' spp.)\n* [[white ash]] (''Fraxinus americana'')\n* [[eastern white pine]] (''Pinus strobus'')\n* [[eastern hemlock]] (''Tsuga canadensis'')\n{{Div col end}}\n\n====Common understory vegetation includes====\n{{Div col}}\n* [[flowering dogwood]] (''Cornus Florida'')\n* [[sumac]] (''Rhus'' spp.)\n* sassafras (''[[Sassafras albidum]]'')\n* [[sourwood]] (''Oxydendrum arboreum'')\n* [[Amelanchier arborea|downy serviceberry]] (''Amelanchier'' spp.)\n* [[redbud]] (''Cercis canadensis'')\n* eastern hophornbeam (''[[Ostrya virginiana]]'')\n* [[American hornbeam]] (''Carpinus caroliniana'')\n{{Div col end}}\n\n====Mockernut is also associated with====\n{{Div col}}\n* wild grapes (''[[Vitis]]'' spp.)\n* rosebay rhododendron (''[[Rhododendron maximum]]'')\n* mountain-laurel (''[[Kalmia latifolia]]'')\n* [[Smilax|greenbriers]] (''Smilax'' spp.)\n* [[blueberry|blueberries]] (''Vaccinium'' spp.)\n* witch-hazel (''[[Hamamelis virginiana]]'')\n* spicebush (''[[Lindera benzoin]]'')\n* New Jersey tea (''[[Ceanothus]] americanus'')\n* wild hydrangea (''[[Hydrangea arborescens]]'')\n* [[tick-trefoil]] (''Desmodium'' spp.)\n* bluestem (''[[Andropogon]]'' spp.)\n* poverty oatgrass (''[[Danthonia spicata]]'')\n* [[Carex|sedge]]s (''Carex'' spp.)\n* pussytoes (''[[Antennaria]]'' spp.)\n* [[goldenrod]] (''Solidago'' spp.)\n* asters (''[[Aster (genus)|Aster]]'' or other genera, depending on the classification).\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===In the southern forest, mockernut grows with===\n{{Div col}}\n* shortleaf pine\n* loblolly pine\n* pignut hickory\n* gums\n* oaks\n* sourwood\n* [[winged elm]] (''Ulmus alata'')\n* flowering dogwood\n* redbud\n* sourwood\n* [[persimmon]] (''Diospyros uirginiana'')\n* eastern redcedar (''[[Juniperus virginiana]]'')\n* sumacs\n* [[Crataegus|hawthorn]]s (''Crataegus'' spp.)\n* blueberries\n* [[honeysuckle]] (''Lonicera'' spp.)\n* mountain-laurel\n* viburnums\n* greenbriers\n* grapes\n{{Div col end}}\n\n====In the Loblolly Pine-Hardwood Type in the southern forest, mockernut commonly grows in the upland and drier sites with====\n{{Div col}}\n* [[white oak]] (''Quercus alba'')\n* post oak\n* [[northern red oak]] (''Q. rubra'')\n* [[southern red oak]] (''Q. falcata'')\n* scarlet oak\n* shagbark and pignut hickories\n* blackgum\n* flowering dogwood\n* hawthorn\n* sourwood\n* greenbrier\n* grape\n* honeysuckle\n* blueberry\n{{Div col end}}\n\n====In the southern bottom lands, mockernut occurs in the Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak Type along with====\n{{Div col}}\n* [[green ash]] (''Fraxinus pennsylvanica'')\n* [[white ash]]\n* shagbark\n* [[Carya laciniosa|Shellbark hickory]] (''Carya laciniosa'')\n* bitternut hickories\n* white oak\n* Delta post oak (''[[Quercus stellata]]'' var.

Mockernut male flowers are [[catkin]]s about {{convert|10|to|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and may be produced on branches from [[axil]]s of leaves of the previous season or from the inner scales of the terminal buds at the base of the current growth. The female flowers appear in short spikes on [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]s terminating in shoots of the current year. Flowers bloom in the spring from April to May, depending on latitude and weather. Usually the male flowers emerge before the female flowers. Hickories produce very large amounts of pollen that is dispersed by the wind.\n\nFruits are solitary or paired and globose, ripening in September and October, and are about {{convert|2.5|to|9.0|cm|in|abbr=on}} long with a short necklike base. The fruit has a thick, four-ribbed husk {{convert|3|to|4|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick that usually splits from the middle to the base. The nut is distinctly four-angled with a reddish-brown, very hard shell {{convert|5|to|6|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick containing a small edible [[Seed|kernel]].\n\n====Seed production and dissemination====\nThe seed is dispersed from September through December. Mockernut hickory requires a minimum of 25 years to reach commercial seed-bearing age. Optimum seed production occurs from 40 to 125 years, and the maximum age listed for commercial seed production is 200 years.\n\nGood seed crops occur every 2 to 3 years with light seed crops in intervening years. Approximately 50 to 75 percent of fresh seed will germinate. Fourteen mockernut hickory trees in southeastern Ohio produced an average annual crop of 6,285 nuts for 6 years; about 39 percent were sound, 48 percent aborted, and 13 percent had insect damage. [[Hickory shuckworm]] (''Laspeyresia caryana'') is probably a major factor in reducing germination.\n\nMockernut hickory produces one of the heaviest seeds of the hickory species; cleaned seeds range from 70 to 250 seeds/kg (32 to 113/lb). Seed is disseminated mainly by gravity and wildlife, particularly squirrels. Birds also help disperse seed. Wildlife such as squirrels and chipmunks often bury the seed at some distance from the seed-bearing tree.\n\n====Seedling development====\nHickory seeds show embryo dormancy that can be overcome by [[Stratification (botany)|stratification]] in a moist medium at 1\u00b0 to 4&nbsp;\u00b0C (33\u00b0 to 40&nbsp;\u00b0F) for 30 to 150 days. When stored for a year or more, seed may require stratification for only 30 to 60 days. Hickory nuts seldom remain viable in the ground for more than I year. Hickory species normally require a moderately moist seedbed for satisfactory seed germination, and mockernut hickory seems to reproduce best in moist [[plant litter|duff]]. Germination is [[hypogeal germination|hypogeal]].\n\nMockernut seedlings are not fast-growing. The height growth of mockernut seedlings observed in the Ohio Valley in the open or under light shade on red clay soil was as follows:\n\n{|\n! Age\n! colspan=\"2\" | Height\n|-\n| (yr) || (cm) || (in)\n|-\n| 1    || 8    || 3.0\n|-\n| 2    || 12   || 4.7\n|-\n| 3    || 20   || 8.0\n|-\n| 4    || 32   || 12.5\n|-\n| 5    || 51   || 20.0\n|-\n| 6    || 71   || 28.0\n|}\n\n====Vegetative reproduction====\nTrue hickories sprout prolifically from stumps after cutting and fire. As the stumps increase in size, the number of stumps that produce sprouts decreases; age is probably directly correlated to stump size and sprouting. Coppice management is a possibility with true hickories. True hickories are difficult to reproduce from cuttings. Madden discussed the techniques for selecting, packing, and storing hickory propagation wood. Reed indicated that the most tested hickory species for root stock for pecan hickory grafts were mockernut and water hickory (''[[Carya aquatica]]'').\n\nHowever, mockernut root stock grew slowly and reduced the growth of pecan tops. Also, this graft seldom produced a tree that bore well or yielded large nuts.\n\n===Sapling and pole stages to maturity===\n\n====Growth and yield====\nMockernut hickory is a large, true hickory with a dense crown. This species occasionally grows to about {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|91|cm|in|abbr=on}} in [[d.b.h.]], but heights and diameters usually range from about {{convert|15|and|46|to|61|cm|in|abbr=on}}, respectively.\n\nThe relation of height to age is as follows:\n\n{|\n!\n! colspan=\"4\" | Height\n|-\n! Age\n! colspan=\"2\" | Cumberland Mountains\n! colspan=\"2\" | Mississippi Valley\n|-\n| (yr) || (m) || (ft) || (m) || (ft)\n|-\n| 10 || 1.2 || 4 || 2.7 || 9\n|-\n| 20 || 5.2 || 17 || 5.5 || 18\n|-\n| 30 || 7.9 || 26 || 7.6 || 25\n|-\n| 40 || 10.1 || 33 || 9.1 || 30\n|-\n| 60 || 13.7 || 45 || 12.2 || 40\n|-\n| 80 || 16.8 || 55 || 14.9 || 49\n|-\n| 100 || 20.1 || 66 || 17.4 || 57\n|-\n| 120 || 23.2 || 76 || 19.8 || 65\n|-\n| 160 || 28.7 || 94 || 24.4 || 80\n|-\n| 200 || 33.2 || 109 || 29.0 || 95\n|}\n\nThe current annual growth of mockernut hickory on dry sites is estimated at about 1.0 m\u00b3/ha (15&nbsp;ft\u00b3/acre). In fully stocked stands on moderately fertile soil2.1 m\u00b3 /ha (30&nbsp;ft\u00b3 /acre) is estimated, though annual growth rates of 3.1 m\u00b3/ha (44&nbsp;ft\u00b3/acre) were reported in Ohio (26). Greenwood and bark weights for commercial-size mockernut trees from mixed hardwoods in Georgia are available for total tree and saw-log stems to a 4-inch top for trees 5 to 22&nbsp;inches d.b.h..\n\nAvailable growth data and other research information is summarized for hickory species, not for individual species. Trimble compared growth rates of various Appalachian hardwoods including a hickory species category Dominant-codominant hickory trees {{convert|38|to|51|cm|in|abbr=on}} in d.b.h. on good oak sites grew slowly compared to northern red oak, yellow-poplar, [[black cherry]] (''Prunus serotina''), and [[sugar maple]] (''Acer saccharum''). Hickories were in the white oak, [[sweet birch]] (''Betula lenta''), and [[American beech]] (''Fagus grandifolia'') growth-rate category. Dominant-codominant hickory trees grew about {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}} d.b.h. per year compared to {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on}} for the moderate-growth species (black cherry) and {{convert|6|mm|in|abbr=on}} for the faster-growing species (yellow-poplar and red oak). Equations are available for predicting merchantable gross volumes from hickory stump diameters in Ohio. Also, procedures are described for predicting diameters and heights and for developing volume tables to any merchantable top diameter for hickory species in southern Illinois and West Virginia. Generally, [[epicormic shoot|epicormic branching]] is not a problem with hickory species, but a few branches do occur.\n\n====Rooting habit====\nTrue hickories such as mockernut develop a long [[taproot]] with few laterals. The species is [[windfirm]]. Early root growth is primarily into the taproot, which typically reaches a depth of {{convert|30|to|91|cm|in|abbr=on}} during the first year. Small laterals originate along the taproot, but many die back during the fall. During the second year, the taproot may reach a depth of {{convert|122|cm|in}}, and the laterals grow rapidly. After 5 years, the root system attains its maximum depth, and the horizontal spread of the roots is about double that of the crown. By age 10, the height is 4 times the depth of the taproot.\n\n====Reaction to competition====\nAt certain times during its life, mockernut hickory may be variously classified as [[Physiological tolerance|tolerant]] to intolerant. Overall it is classified as intolerant of shade. It recovers rapidly from suppression and is probably a climax species on moist sites.\n\n[[Silviculture|Silvicultural]] practices for managing the oak-hickory type have been summarized. Establishing the seedling origin of hickory trees is difficult because of seed predators. Although infrequent bumper seed crops usually provide some seedlings, seedling survival is poor under a dense canopy. Because of prolific sprouting ability, hickory reproduction can survive browsing, breakage, drought, and fire. Top dieback and resprouting may occur several times, each successive shoot reaching a larger size and developing a stronger root system than its predecessors. By this process, hickory reproduction gradually accumulates and grows under moderately dense canopies, especially on sites dry enough to restrict reproduction of more tolerant but more fire or drought-sensitive species.\n\nWherever adequate hickory advance reproduction occurs, [[clearcutting]] results in new sapling stands containing some hickories. It is difficult to attain reproduction if advance hickory regeneration is inadequate, however; then clearcutting will eliminate hickories except for stump sprouts. In theory, light thinnings or [[shelterwood]] cuts can be used to create advance hickory regeneration, but this has not been demonstrated.\n\n====Damaging agents====\nMockernut hickory is extremely sensitive to fire because of the low insulating capacity of the hard, flinty bark. Mockernut is not subject to severe loss from disease. The main fungus of hickory is ''Poria spiculosa'', a trunk rot. This fungus kills the bark, which produces a canker, causes heart rot and decay, and can seriously degrade the tree. Mineral streaks and [[sapsucker]]-induced streaks also degrade the lumber. In general, the hard, strong, and durable wood of hickories makes them relatively resistant to decay fungi. Most fungi cause little, if any, decay in small, young trees.\n\nCommon foliage diseases include leaf mildew and witches' broom (''[[Microstroma juglandis]]''), leaf blotch (''[[Mycosphaerella dendroides]]''), and pecan scab (''[[Cladosporium effusum]]''). Mockernut hickory is host to [[anthracnose]] (''Gnomonia caryae'').\n\nNuts of all hickory species are susceptible to attack by the hickory nut weevil (''[[Curculio caryae]]''). Another weevil (''[[Conotrachelus aratus]]'') attacks young shoots and leaf [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]s. The ''Curculio'' species are the most damaging and can destroy 65 percent of the hickory nut crop. Hickory shuckworms also damage nuts.\n\nThe bark beetle (''[[Scolytus quadrispinosus]]'') attacks mockernut hickory, especially in drought years and where hickory species are growing rapidly. The hickory spiral borer (''[[Argilus arcuatus]] torquatus'') and the pecan carpenterworm (''[[Cossula magnifica]]'') are also serious insect enemies of mockernut. The hickory bark beetle probably destroys more sawtimber-size mockernut trees than any other insect. The hickory spiral borer kills many seedlings and young trees, and the pecan carpenterworm degrades both trees and logs. The twig girdler (''[[Oncideres cingulata]]'') attacks both small and large trees; it seriously deforms trees by sawing branches. Sometimes these girdlers cut hickory seedlings near ground level.\n\nTwo [[casebearer]]s (''Acrobasis caryivorella'' and ''A. juglandis'') feed on buds and leaves; later they bore into succulent hickory shoots. Larvae of ''A. caryivorella'' may destroy entire nut sets. The living-hickory borer (''[[Goes pulcher]]'') feeds on hickory boles and branches throughout the East. Borers commonly found on dying or dead hickory trees or cut logs include:\n\n* the banded hickory borer (''[[Knulliana cincta]]'')\n* a long-horned beetle (''[[Saperda discoidea]]'')\n* the apple twig borer (''[[Amphicerus bicaudatus]]'')\n* the flatheaded ambrosia beetle (''[[Platypus compositus]]'')\n* the redheaded ash borer (''[[Neoclytus acuminatus]]'')\n* the false powderpost beetle (''[[Scobicia bidentata]]'')\n\nSevere damage to hickory lumber and manufactured hickory products is caused by powderpost beetles (''[[Lyctus]]'' spp. and ''[[Polycanon stoutii]]''). Gall insects (''[[Caryomyia]]'' spp.) commonly infest leaves. The fruit-tree [[leafroller]] (''[[Archips argyrospila]]'') and the hickory leafroller (''[[Argyrotaenia juglandana]]'') are the most common leaf feeders. The giant bark aphid (''[[Longistigma caryae]]'') is common on hickory bark. This aphid usually feeds on twigs and can cause branch mortality. The European fruit [[lecanium]] (''[[Parthnolecanium corni]]'') is common on hickories.\n\nMockernut is not easily injured by ice glaze or snow, but young seedlings are very susceptible to frost damage. Many birds and animals feed on the nuts of mockernut hickory. This feeding combined with insect and disease problems eliminates the annual nut production, except during bumper seed crop years.\n\n==Special uses==\n[[File:CaryaTomentosaBark.jpg|right|thumb|Closeup of Bark]]Mockernuts are preferred mast for wildlife, particularly squirrels, which eat green nuts. Black bears, foxes, rabbits, beavers, and white-footed mice feed on the nuts, and sometimes the bark. The white-tailed deer browse on foliage and twigs and also feed on nuts. Hickory nuts are a minor source of food for ducks, quail, and turkey.\n\nMockernut hickory nuts are consumed by many species of birds and other animals, including wood duck, red-bellied woodpecker, red fox, squirrels, beaver, eastern cottontail, eastern chipmunk, turkey, white-tailed deer, white-footed mice, and others. Many insect pests eat hickory leaves and bark. Mockernut hickories also provide cavities for animals to live in, such as woodpeckers, black rat snakes, raccoons, Carolina chickadees, and more. They are also good nesting trees, providing cover for birds with their thick foliage. Animals help disperse seeds so that new hickories can grow elsewhere. Chipmunks, squirrels, and birds do this best. Some fungi grow on mockernut hickory roots, sharing nutrients from the soil.<ref name=\"Mockernut hickory\">''Mockernut hickory.'' (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.fcps.edu/islandcreekes/ecology/mockernut_hickory.htm</ref>\n\nTrue hickories provide a very large portion of the high-grade hickory used by industry. Mockernut is used for lumber, [[pulpwood]], [[charcoal]], and other fuelwood products. Hickory species are preferred species for fuelwood consumption. Mockernut has the second highest heating value among the species of hickories. It can be used for [[Wood veneer|veneer]], but the low supply of logs of veneer quality is a limiting factor.\n\nMockernut hickory is used for tool handles requiring high shock resistance. It is used for ladder rungs, athletic goods, agricultural implements, dowels, gymnasium apparatus, poles, shafts, well pumps, and furniture. Lower grade lumber is used for pallets, blocking, and so on. Hickory sawdust, chips, and some solid wood are often used by packing companies to smoke meats, and mockernut is the preferred wood for smoking hams. Though mockernut kernels are edible, because of their size they are rarely eaten by humans.\n\nMockernut hickory is used for smoking meats such as ham.<ref name=\"Miller\">Miller, J.H., & Miller, K.V. (1999). ''Forest plants of the southeast and their wildlife uses''. Champaign, IL: Kings Time Printing.</ref>\n\n==Genetics==\nThe mockernut is a 64 chromosome species and therefore very rarely if ever crosses with 32 chromosome species such as pecan or shellbark hickory. There is no published information concerning population or other genetic studies of this species.\n\nHickories are noted for their variability, and many natural hybrids are known among North American species. Hickories usually can be crossed successfully within the genus. Geneticists recognize that mockernut hickory hybridizes naturally with: ''C. illinoensis'' (''Carya'' x ''schneckii'' Sarg.) and ''C. ovata'' (''Carya'' x ''collina'' Laughlin).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{commons category|Carya tomentosa}}\n*Baker, Frederick S. 1949.

The native range is from Maryland and extreme southern [[New Jersey]] and southeast [[Pennsylvania]] south to central Florida, west to eastern Texas, and north to southern [[Missouri]] and [[Kentucky]]. The plant's habitat is dry sandy and rocky uplands and ridges mixed with [[oak]] and [[hickory]] to 1000 m elevation. It grows best on well-drained soils in full sun or partial shade.\n\n==Growth==\nIt is a spreading shrub or small tree, reaching 2\u20138 m in height at maturity. The [[bark]] is red- or gray-brown and slightly furrowed into scaly plates. The [[leaf|leaves]] are simple, narrowly elliptical or lanceolate, yellow-green above and paler and finely hairy on the underside. Each leaf is 7.5\u201315&nbsp;cm long by 3\u20135&nbsp;cm wide with parallel side veins ending in short pointed teeth. The flowers are monoecious and appear in early summer. Male flowers are small and pale yellow to white, borne on erect [[catkin]]s 10\u201315&nbsp;cm long attached to the base of each leaf. Female flowers are 3&nbsp;mm long and are located at the base of some catkins. The fruit is a golden-colored [[Calybium and cupule|cupule]] 2\u20133&nbsp;cm in diameter with many sharp spines, maturing in autumn. Each cupule contains one ovoid shiny dark brown nut that is edible.\n\n==Habitat==\nThe Allegheny chinquapin is closely related to the [[American chestnut]], ''Castanea dentata'', and both trees can be found in the same habitat. Allegheny chinquapin can be distinguished by its smaller nut (half the size of a chestnut) that is not flattened (chestnuts are flattened on one side). The leaves of the Allegheny chinquapin are smaller than the American chestnut and have less distinct teeth. Allegheny chinquapin, however, is less susceptible to the [[chestnut blight]] fungus that devastated the American chestnut. While the chinquapin does blight to some degree, it continues to send out [[basal shoot|suckers]] that will produce fruit. Chinquapins are quite vulnerable nevertheless, and there are many reports of heavily diseased and cankered trees.\n\n==Uses==\n[[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] of  [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] made the first record of the tree and its nuts in 1612, observing its use by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Native Americans made an infusion of chinquapin leaves to relieve headaches and fevers. The bark, leaves, wood, and seed husks of the plant contain [[tannin]]. The wood is hard and durable and is sometimes used in [[fence]]s and fuel, but the plant is too small for the wood to be of commercial importance.\n\nChinquapins are used in landscapes for the purpose of attracting wildlife. When the base of plant is cut or wounded at ground level the plant will grow multiple stalks producing a thick cover used by turkeys. The nuts are consumed by squirrels and rabbits while white tail deer graze upon the foliage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wildlife Gardening: Chinquapin Tree |url=http://www.preppergarden.biz/Chinquapin-Bush-for-Preppers-p/nut-chinquapin.htm|publisher=Prepper Gardens|accessdate=January 23, 2014}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=October 2014}}\n==References==\n{{more footnotes|date=October 2014}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Little, Elbert L.

They secrete nectar, a most unusual characteristic for leaves, by means of groups of tiny glands in the axils of the primary veins.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n[[Image:Le Roeulx AR1cJPG.jpg|thumb|left|''Catalpa bignonioides'' cv. Aurea|200px]]\n\nThe [[flower]]s are 2.5\u20134&nbsp;cm across, trumpet shaped, white with yellow spots inside; they grow in [[panicle]]s of 20-40.  In the northern states of the USA, it is a late bloomer, putting forth great panicles of white flowers in June or early in July when the flowers of other trees have mostly faded.  These cover the tree so thickly as almost to conceal the full grown leaves.  The general effect of the flower cluster is a pure white, but the individual corolla is spotted with purple and gold, and some of these spots are arranged in lines along a ridge, so as to lead directly to the honey sweets within.  A single flower when fully expanded is two inches long and an inch and a half wide.  It is two-lipped and the lips are lobed, two lobes above and three below, as is not uncommon with such corollas.  The flower is perfect, possessing both stamens and pistils; nevertheless, the law of elimination is at work and of the five stamens that we should expect to find, three have aborted, ceased to bear anthers and have become filaments simply.  Then, too, the flowers refuse to be self-fertilized.  Each flower has its own stamens and its own stigma but the lobes of the stigma remain closed until after the anthers have opened and discharged their pollen; after they have withered and become effete then the stigma opens and invites the wandering bee.  The entire Pink family behave in this way.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n[[Image:Louvignies CH AR2aJPG.jpg|thumb|right|''Catalpa bignonioides''|300px]]\n\n[[File:Catalpa bignoioides 004.JPG|thumb|upright|''Catalpa'' bean pods]]\nThe [[fruit]] is a long, thin bean like pod 20\u201340&nbsp;cm long and 8\u201310&nbsp;mm diameter; it often stays attached to tree during winter. The pod contains numerous flat light brown seeds with two papery wings.\n\nIt is closely related to the Northern Catalpa (''[[Catalpa speciosa|C. speciosa]]''), and can be distinguished by the flowering panicles, which bear a larger number of smaller flowers, and the slightly slenderer seed pods.\n\n* Bark: Light brown tinged with red.  Branchlets forking regularly by pairs, at first green, shaded with purple and slightly hairy, later gray or yellowish brown, finally reddish brown.  Contains tannin.\n* Wood: Light brown, sapwood nearly white; light, soft, coarse-grained and durable in contact with the soil.\n* Winter buds: No terminal bud, uppermost bud is axillary.  Minute, globular, deep in the bark.  Outer scales fall when spring growth begins, inner scales enlarge with the growing shoot, become green, hairy and sometimes two inches long.\n* Leaves: Opposite, or in threes, simple, six to ten inches long, four to five broad.  Broadly ovate, cordate at base, entire, sometimes wavy, acute or acuminate.  Feather-veined, midrib and primary veins prominent.  Clusters of dark glands, which secrete nectar are found in the axils of the primary veins.  They come out of the bud involute, purplish, when full grown are bright green, smooth above, pale green, and downy beneath.  When bruised they give a disagreeable odor.  They turn dark and fall after the first severe frost.  Petioles stout, terete, long.\n* Flowers: June, July.  Perfect, white, borne in many-flowered thyrsoid panicles, eight to ten inches long.  Pedicels slender, downy.\n* Calyx: Globular and pointed in the bud; finally splitting into two, broadly ovate, entire lobes, green or light purple.\n* Corolla: Campanulate, tube swollen, slightly oblique, two-lipped, five-lobed, the two lobes above smaller than the three below, imbricate in bud; limb spreading, undulate, when fully expanded is an inch and a half wide and nearly two inches long, white, marked on the inner surface with two rows of yellow blotches and in the throat on the lower lobes with purple spots.\n* Stamens: Two, rarely four, inserted near the base of the corolla, introrse, slightly exserted; anthers oblong, two-celled, opening longitudinally; filaments flattened, thread-like.

Sugarberry has narrower leaves which are smoother above.  The species can also be distinguished by habitat: where the ranges overlap, common hackberry occurs primarily in upland areas, whereas sugarberry occurs mainly in bottomland areas.\n\nSugarberry's range extends from the [[Eastern United States]] west to [[Texas]] and south to northeastern [[Mexico]].<ref name=\"GRIN\"/> It is also found on the island of [[Bermuda]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conservation.bm/southern-hackberry/ |title=Southern Hackberry (''Celtis laevigata'') |work=Bermuda's Species |publisher=Department of Conservation Services, Government of Bermuda |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n\nSugarberry occurs primarily along streams and in moist soils on [[floodplain]]s.

The  remarkable bark pattern is even more pronounced in younger trees, with the irregularly-spaced ridges resembling long geologic palisades of sedimentary [layered] rock formations when viewed edge-wise [cross-section]. Coins as large as USA quarters can easily be laid flat against the valleys, which may be as deep as an adult human finger.\n\nThe leaves are distinctly asymmetrical and coarse-textured.  It produces small fruits that turn orange-red to dark purple in the [[autumn]], often staying on the trees for several months.

Although there is little actual overlap, in the western part of its range the common hackberry is sometimes confused with the smaller netleaf hackberry (''Celtis reticulata''), which has a similar bark. Hackberry grows in many different habitats, although it prefers bottomlands and soils high in [[limestone]].  Its [[shade tolerance]] is greatly dependent on conditions.

The leaves are eaten by four gall-producing insects of the ''[[Pachypsylla]]'' genus, which do not cause serious damage to the tree.  A number of insects and fungi cause rapid decay of dead branches or roots of the tree.\n\nThe small berries, hackberries, are eaten by a number of birds and mammals.  Most seeds are dispersed by animals, but some seeds are also dispersed by water.\n\nThe tree serves as a butterfly larval host particularly the [[hackberry emperor]].<ref>http://www.nativeplantcenter.net/?q=plants/1211</ref>\n\n== Cultivation and uses ==\n[[File:Bodjos sombor.jpg|thumb|right|One of the streets with 'bo\u0111o\u0161' in Sombor, Serbia]]\nHackberry's wood is light yellow; heavy, soft, coarse-grained, not strong.  It rots easily, making the wood undesirable commercially, although it is occasionally used for fencing and cheap furniture.  [[Specific gravity]], 0.7287; weight of cu. ft., {{convert|45.41|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nHackberry is only occasionally used as a street or landscape tree, although its tolerance for urban conditions makes it well suited to this role. Ridjica and [[Sombor]] in [[Serbia]] (where it is called \u0431\u043e\u0452\u043e\u0448 / ''bo\u0111o\u0161'' {{IPA-sh|bod\u0291o\u0283|}} in Sombor, \u0433\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0433\u0443\u045a\u0430 / ''galagunja'' {{IPA-sh|galagu\u0272a|}} in [[Subotica]], and \u043a\u043e\u0448\u045b\u0435\u043b\u0430 / ''ko\u0161\u0107ela'' {{IPA-sh|ko\u0283t\u0255ela|}} in the rest of the country) and [[Bratislava]], the capital of [[Slovakia]], are known for the extensive use of hackberry (in the latter case along with closely related but Eurasian ''[[Celtis australis]]'') as a street tree.\n\nThe tree's pea-sized berries are edible, ripening in early September.

The  winter buds are brown and hairy, similar to those of other hackberries, but smaller, only 1 to 2 centimeters long. Terminal  buds absent.\n\nFlowers are [[monecious]] and unisexual, occurring either solitarily or in small clusters. This species is wind-pollinated and appears to be self-compatible.\n\nThe fruit is a berry-like [[drupe]], 5 to 8 millimeters in diameter, consisting of a single stone encased within a thin, sweet [[mesocarp]].  From green, it becomes a light orange, then a dark red, then purplish-brown.  This edible mesocarp is composed of a smooth outer crust and a pulpy yellow inside.\n\n==Ecology and Uses==\nDwarf hackberry is shade intolerant, [[drought tolerant]] and slow-growing. It grows in dry upland habitats, including open woodlands, [[alvar]]s, and sandy near-shore habitats.  It is usually not found among other hackberries, although when other [[Celtis|hackberry]] species occur in proximity to dwarf hackberry, intermediate forms may occur. Like other ''[[Celtis]]'' species, this species is a moderate [[calciphile]], and is often found growing in thin soil over [[limestone]].\n\nDispersal is primarily by birds although mammals are attracted by the sweet fruit and likely play a role in local dispersal.\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Celtis tenuifolia}}\nBurton V.

It generally has a short, often twisted [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] and spreading [[branch]]es. A 10-year-old tree will generally be around {{convert|5|m|0|abbr=on}} tall. The [[bark]] is dark in color, smooth, later scaly with ridges somewhat apparent, sometimes with maroon patches. The [[twig]]s are slender and zigzag, nearly black in color, spotted with lighter [[lenticel]]s. The winter buds are tiny, rounded and dark red to chestnut in color. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, simple, and heart shaped with an entire margin, {{convert|7|\u2013|12|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and wide, thin and papery, and may be slightly hairy below.\n\nThe [[flower]]s are showy, light to dark magenta pink in color, {{convert|1.5|cm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}} long, appearing in clusters from Spring to early Summer, on bare stems before the leaves, sometimes on the trunk itself. The flowers are pollinated by long-tongued bees such as blueberry bees and carpenter bees. Short-tongued bees apparently cannot reach the nectaries. The [[fruit]] are flattened, dry, brown, [[pea]]-like pods, {{convert|5|\u2013|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long that contain flat, elliptical, brown [[seed]]s {{convert|6|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long, maturing in August to October.\n\nIn some parts of southern Appalachia, green twigs from the eastern redbud are used as seasoning for wild game such as venison and opossum. Because of this, in these mountain areas the eastern redbud is sometimes known as the spicewood tree.\n\nIn the wild, eastern redbud is a frequent native understory tree in mixed forests and hedgerows. It is also much planted as a [[landscape]] [[ornamental plant]]. The leaves are eaten by the [[caterpillar]]s of some [[Lepidoptera]], for example the [[Automeris io|Io moth]] (''Automeris io'').\n\n[[File:Cercis canadensis 'Forest Pansy' JPG1Fe.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Cercis canadensis'' 'Forest Pansy' leaves.]]\n[[File:Cercis Canadensis Leaf.png|thumb|''C. canadensis'' Leaf]]\n[[Image:Xylocopa 9789.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Carpenter bee]] (''[[Eastern carpenter bee|Xylocopa virginica]]'') on redbud flowers.]]\n[[File:Cardinalis cardinalis in Cercis canadensis.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''[[Northern cardinal|Cardinalis cardinalis]]'' male feeding female, in a white-flowered ''C. canadensis'']]\n\nIn the United States, this tree is difficult to grow further west into arid areas west of western [[Kansas]] and [[Colorado]], as there is not sufficient annual precipitation. Its far northern range of growth is the lower Midwest, Ohio Valley, to the south of Boston. There has been success with growing the tree in [[Columbus, Wisconsin]], which has become known as the \"Columbus Strain\" and a seed source for nurseries.\n\n* Bark: Red brown, with deep fissures and scaly surface. Branchlets at first lustrous brown, later become darker.\n* Wood: Dark reddish brown; heavy, hard, coarse-grained, not strong. Sp. gr., 0.6363; weight of cu. ft. 39.65&nbsp;lbs.\n* Winter buds: Chestnut brown, obtuse, one-eighth inch long.\n* Leaves: Alternate, simple, heart-shaped or broadly ovate, two to five inches long, five to seven-nerved, chordate or truncate at the base, entire, acute. They come out of the bud folded along the line of the midrib, tawny green; when they are full grown they become smooth, dark green above, paler beneath. In autumn they turn bright clear yellow. Petioles slender, terete, enlarged at the base. Stipules caduceous.\n* Flowers: April, May, before and with the leaves, papilionaceous. Perfect, rose color, borne four to eight together, in fascicles which appear at the axils of the leaves or along the branch and sometimes on the trunk itself.\n* Calyx: Dark red, campanulate, oblique, five-toothed, imbricate in bud.\n* Corolla: Papilionaceous, petals five, nearly equal, pink or rose color, upper petal the smallest, enclosed in the bud by the wings, and encircled by the broader keel petals.\n* Stamens: Ten, inserted in two rows on a thin disk, free, the inner row rather shorter than the others.\n* Pistil: Ovary superior, inserted obliquely in the bottom of the calyx tube, stipitate; style fleshy, incurved, tipped with an obtuse stigma.\n* Fruit: Legume, slightly stipitate, unequally oblong, acute at each end. Compressed, tipped with the remnants of the style, straight on upper and curved on the lower edge. Two and a half to three inches long, rose color, full grown by midsummer, falls in early winter. Seeds ten to twelve, chestnut brown, one-fourth of an inch long -can be made to germinate by first dipping in boiled (99C) water (very hot) for a minute and then sowing in a pot (do not boil the seeds); cotyledons oval, flat.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book| last =Keeler| first =Harriet L.| title =Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them| publisher =Charles Scriber's Sons| year =1900| location =New York| pages =104\u2013108}}</ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\n''C. canadensis'' is grown in parks and gardens, with several [[cultivars]] being available.

It prefers habitats where the soil is saturated with water at least during the majority of the growing season. The soils in these regions have a thick organic layer, often classified as a [[soil horizon#Diagnostic surface horizons of mineral soils|histic surface horizon]], with sandy material at greater depths and poor drainage. Atlantic white cedar wetlands are acidic and there is little oxygen stored in the soil because water has displaced the air.  Plants that live in these environments must be specially adapted to such conditions.\n\nThough the tree is not listed as threatened, Atlantic white cedar wetlands are considered a globally threatened ecosystem, and often serve as [[carbon sinks]] because of their [[peat]]-building abilities.<ref name=\"mylecraine_rangewide\" /><ref name=\"biological_report\" /><ref name=\"crawford\">{{cite journal|author=Crawford ER|title=Influence of environment and substrate quality on root decomposition in naturally regenerating and restored Atlantic white cedar wetlands|journal=Wetlands|date=2007|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1\u201311|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[1:ioeasq]2.0.co;2}}</ref>\n\n===Ecology===\n[[Red maple]] and [[Nyssa sylvatica|black gum]] trees are often found in the canopy along with Atlantic white cedar throughout its range.

This keep the tree from being underwater year-round and helps to protect from floods. The tree benefits from periodic low-intensity fires which expose [[seedlings]] to sunlight and limit competition with other canopy [[flora]], particularly Red Maple. Too frequent or intense fires or flooding are damaging to seedlings stored in the top layer of soil and full-grown trees.<ref name=\"plantsprofile\" />\n\n==Description==\n''C. thyoides'' is an [[evergreen]] [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] [[tree]] usually growing to 20\u201328 m (but may grow up to 35 m) tall with an average diameter of 0.8 m (up to 2 m) and feathery foliage in moderately flattened sprays, green to [[glaucous]] blue-green in color. The [[leaf|leaves]] are scale-like, 2\u20134&nbsp;mm long, and produced in opposite [[decussate]] pairs on somewhat flattened shoots; seedlings up to a year old have needle-like leaves. The tree is bare of branches for 3/4 of the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] height and the [[bark]] can be ash-gray to reddish brown.  Bark is smooth on juveniles, but mature trees have deep ridges and bark as thick as 5&nbsp;cm. ''C. thyoides'' is [[monoecious]], so a single tree will carry both the pollen and seeds needed for reproduction in cones.  The [[conifer cone|seed cones]] are [[globose]], 4\u20139&nbsp;mm diameter, with 6-10 scales (1-2 seeds per scale), green or purple, maturing to brown in 5\u20137 months after pollination. The pollen cones are yellow but turn brown as the tree matures, 1.5\u20133&nbsp;mm long and 1\u20132&nbsp;mm broad, releasing their yellow pollen once a year in spring.<ref name=farjon/><ref name=rushforthc>Rushforth, K.

Both height and diameter no longer increase once the tree is 100 years old.  Stands are generally all younger than 200 years, though some trees as old as a 1000 years have been reported.

The most common use of white cedar wood is lumber, for which stands usually require 70 years of growth from [[germination]] to harvest.  The lumber may be used in house construction, though scarcity of Atlantic white cedar makes it difficult to be used as the primary material.  The wood was favored for use as roof shingles because it is lightweight, but has since been replaced by cheaper and more fire-resistant materials such as asphalt.  The durability of the [[heartwood]] makes it popular for use as siding and paneling, and the less resistant sapwood has been used for interior finishes. White cedar lumber has also been used in [[Boat building|boat construction]], but this requires much older, larger trees.  [[North Carolina]] is the greatest producer of lumber for boat construction because it has the greatest number of [[Old-growth forest|old-growth]] ''C. thyoides'' forests.  Other uses include fencing, telephone and electric poles, woodenware, [[Duck decoy (model)|duck decoys]], lawn furniture, and as Christmas trees.<ref name=\"ward_commercial\">{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=Daniel|title=Commercial Utilization of Atlantic white cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides, Cuppressaceae)|journal=Economic Botany|date=1989|volume=43|issue=3|pages=386\u2013415|jstor=4255181|doi=10.1007/bf02858736}}</ref><ref>Peattie, Donald Culross.

''C. lutea'', ''C. tinctoria''), is a species of ''[[Cladrastis]]'' native to the [[Southeastern United States]], with a restricted range from western [[North Carolina]] west to eastern [[Oklahoma]], and from southern [[Missouri]] and [[Indiana]] south to central [[Alabama]]. Also the tree is sometimes called '''Virgilia'''.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book|last=Keeler |first=Harriet L.|title=Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them|publisher=Charles Scriber's Sons|date=1900|location =New York|pages =116\u2013118 }}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Cladrastis kentukea Yellowwood Branch 2000px.jpg|thumb|left|Leaves]]\n''Cladrastis kentukea'' is a small to medium-sized [[deciduous]] [[tree]] typically growing {{convert|10|-|15|m|ft}} tall, exceptionally to {{convert|27|m|ft}} tall, with a broad, rounded crown and smooth gray [[bark]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] are compound pinnate, 20-30 cm long, with 5-11 (mostly 7-9) alternately arranged leaflets, each leaflet broad ovate with an acute apex, 6-13 cm long and 3-7 cm broad, with an entire margin and a thinly to densely hairy underside. In the fall, the leaves turn a mix of yellow, gold, and orange.\n\nThe [[flower]]s are fragrant, white, produced in ''[[Wisteria]]''-like [[raceme]]s 15-30 cm long. Flowering is in early summer (June in its native region), and is variable from year to year, with heavy flowering every second or third year. The [[fruit]] is a [[legume|pod]] 5-8 cm long, containing 2-6 seeds.\n\n* Bark: Smooth gray, or light brown.  Branchlets at first downy, but soon become smooth, light yellowish green; later red brown, finally dark brown.\n* Wood: Yellow to pale brown; heavy, hard, close-grained and strong.  Sp. gr., 0.6278; weight of cu. ft., 39.12 lbs.\n* Winter buds: Four in a group, making a tiny cone and inclosed in the hollow base of the petiole.\n* Leaves: Alternate, pinnately compound, eight to twelve inches long, main stem stout, enlarged at base.  Leaflets seven to eleven, broadly oval, three to four inches long.  Wedge-shaped at base, entire, acute, terminal leaflets rhomboid-ovate.  Feather-veined, midrib and primary veins prominent, grooved above, light yellow beneath.  They come out the bud pale green, downy; when full grown are dark green above, pale beneath.  In autumn they turn a bright clear yellow.\n* Flowers: June.  Perfect, papilionaceous, white, borne in drooping terminal panicles twelve to fourteen inches long, five to six inches broad, slightly fragrant.\n* Calyx: Campanulate, five-lobed, enlarged on the upper side.\n* Corolla: Papilinaceous; standard broad, white, marked on the inner surface with a pale yellow blotch; wings oblong; keel petals free.\n* Stamens: Ten, free; filaments thread-like.\n* Pistil: Ovary superior, linear, bright red, hairy, bearing a long incurved style.\n* Fruit: Legume, smooth, linear-compressed, tipped with the remnants of the styles.  Seeds four to six, dark brown.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n==Distribution==\nOne of the rarest trees of eastern [[North America]].  Found principally on the limestone cliffs of Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina, but it is hardy at the north to zone 4.\n\nThe largest specimen known is at [[Spring Grove Cemetery]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], 22 m tall and 2.2 m trunk diameter; the tallest known is a slender tree 27 m tall but only 0.55 m trunk diameter, at [[Plott Cove Research Natural Area]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (Spongberg & Ma 1997; Eastern Native Trees Society).\n\nPlants from Alabama have the leaves more densely hairy underneath than those from further north, and are distinguished as ''Cladrastis kentukea'' f. ''tomentosa'' (Steyermark) Spongberg.\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Cladrastis kentukea'' is widely grown as an [[ornamental tree]] for its attractive flowers, and is locally [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] in many areas of the eastern United States outside of its restricted [[native plant|native]] range.<ref name=Keeler /> It thrives in full sunlight and in well-drained soil,  tolerates high pH soils as well as acid situations. The Yellowwood can withstand urban settings and is attractive to birds. A number of [[cultivar]]s have been selected, including 'Perkin's Pink' (syn. 'Rosea', an invalid name) with pink flowers.\n\nKentucky yellowwood is recommended as one of the best medium-sized trees for cultivation as an [[ornamental plant]] in [[garden]]s.  The only quality that is mentioned is a tendency of the trunk to divide very near the ground, as a multi-trunked tree.<ref name=Keeler /> [[File:Yellow_WoodTree_Bark_and_low_branching-Cladrastis_kentukea,_family_Fabaceae.jpg|thumb|right|bark and low branching habit]]\n\n==Uses==\nThe name yellowwood derives from its yellow [[heartwood]], used in small amounts for specialist [[furniture]], [[stock (firearm)|gunstocks]] and decorative [[woodturning]].\n==Distinctions==\n\nThe [[Society of Municipal Arborists]] selected the yellowwood (''Cladrastis kentukea'' or ''C. lutea'') as its Urban Tree of the Year for 2015. \n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Andrews, S.

The crown is round to vase-shaped. Branches tend to be somewhat drooping, and the tree is naturally multitrunked. When only a single trunk is allowed to develop, it can attain a diameter of 12 inches.<ref name=Gilman>{{cite web|last1=Gilman|first1=Edward F.|title=Cordia sebestena: Geiger Tree|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/st182|website=University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Extension|accessdate=9 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe dense, evergreen foliage consists of dark green, leathery, [[Phyllotaxis#Pattern structure|alternate]], [[Glossary of botanical terms#O|ovate]] leaves, seven inches long, with wavy margins. These leaves are covered with small hairs, lending them a rough, \"sandpapery\" texture.<ref name=Gilman />\n\nFlowers are produced  in clusters at branch ends throughout the year, particularly in the spring and summer. They are dark orange in color, tubular and flaring ([[Glossary of botanical terms#S|salverform]]) to a width of two inches. Pear-shaped fruits follow the flowers, averaging two inches in length. Fruits are fragrant and edible, but not flavorful.<ref name=Gilman />\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Cordia sebestena'' is widely planted throughout the tropics as an [[ornamental plant]] in gardens for its showy [[flower]]s. It is a slow-growing plant, and sheds enough leaves and fruit to require some upkeep. The wood is rather light in density, but branches are not prone to breakage.The tree should be pruned in its youth to establish a structure, as it is prone to low branching. Soil tolerance is fairly broad, provided the soil drains well.  ''Cordia sebestena'' tolerates drought, but not frost. It is not particularly susceptible to pests and diseases, other than the geiger [[tortoise beetle]],<ref name=Gilman /> which can cause occasional defoliation. This plant tolerates salt spray found near the ocean. It enjoys full sun, and can grow in a part-day sun situation as well. Its uses include: street tree, shade tree, even as a container subject in its youth. It is planted in traffic medians and parking lots, and is a useful seaside subject.<ref name=Gilman />\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Key West FH010018.jpg|A Geiger tree, at [[Audubon House and Tropical Gardens|Geiger's house]] in [[Key West, Florida]] \nImage:Geiger Tree (Cordia sebestena) tree in Hyderabad, AP W 264.jpg| Tree ([[Hyderabad, India]])\nImage:Geiger Tree (Cordia sebestena) flower buds in Hyderabad, AP W 272.jpg| Flower buds ([[Hyderabad, India]])\nImage:Geiger Tree (Cordia sebestena) flowers & leaves in Hyderabad, AP W 260.jpg|Flowers & leaves ([[Hyderabad, India]])\nImage:2013.06-406-015ap Geiger tree=scarlet cordia(Cordia sebestena(Boraginaceae) Dakar,SN sat01jun2013-1052h.jpg|Close-up of flower ([[Dakar]], Senegal)\nImage:Geiger Tree (Cordia sebestena) fruits in Hyderabad, AP W 270.jpg|Fruits ([[Hyderabad, India]])\nImage:Geiger Tree (Cordia sebestena) fallen fruit in Hyderabad, AP W 265.jpg| Fallen fruit ([[Hyderabad, India]])\nImage:Geiger Tree (Cordia sebestena) leaves in Hyderabad, AP W 269.jpg|Leaves, underside ([[Hyderabad, India]])\nImage:Geiger Tree (Cordia sebestena) trunk in Hyderabad, AP W 262.jpg| Trunk ([[Hyderabad, India]])\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=COSE2 USDA plant Classification Cordia sebestena]\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{commonscat-inline|Cordia sebestena|''Cordia sebestena''}}\n{{wikispecies-inline|Cordia sebestena|''Cordia sebestena''}}\n\n[[Category:Cordia|sebestena]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Caribbean]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Bahamas]]\n[[Category:Trees of Belize]]\n[[Category:Trees of Cuba]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Hispaniola]]\n[[Category:Trees of Honduras]]\n[[Category:Trees of Jamaica]]\n[[Category:Trees of Quintana Roo]]\n[[Category:Trees of Panama]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]\n[[Category:Drought-tolerant trees]]\n[[Category:Flowers]]\n[[Category:Flora of North America]]\n\n\n{{Asterid-stub}}",

This tree inhabits wooded bottomlands, the prairie border, and the midwest [[savanna]] understorey.\n\nThis tree grows to 10\u201313 m high with a dense crown of thorny branches and an ash-grey trunk. The [[leaf|leaves]] are 5\u201310&nbsp;cm in length and often drop in late summer due to defoliation by leaf diseases. The tree seems to suffer little from the early loss of its leaves. Among the earliest in the genus to bloom, downy hawthorn also has earliest ripening fruit, which decorate the defoliated tree in late summer and early fall. It is closely related to ''[[Crataegus submollis]]'', but the two species have separate native ranges. Amongst other differences between these two species, ''C. submollis'' has approximately 10 stamens, whereas ''C. mollis'' has approximately 20 stamens per flower.<ref>Phipps, J.B., O\u2019Kennon, R.J., Lance, R.W. (2003). ''Hawthorns and medlars''. Royal Horticultural Society, Cambridge, U.K.</ref>\n\nThe white [[flower]]s are borne in clusters at the end of the branches in spring. The bright red edible fruit ripens in late summer and early fall and falls soon after.\n\nThis species is a target of [[Gypsy moth]]s. Leaf rusts and [[fireblight]] are among the many foliage diseases to affect this species. The sharp thorns are a hazard.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nThis species is uncommon in cultivation.\n\n==Images==\n<gallery>\nImage:Crataegus-mollis-trunk.jpg\nImage:Crataegus-mollis-bud-break.jpg\nImage:Crataegus-mollis-fruit.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*Sternberg, G.

The tree grows wild but has been cultivated for its fruit and wood since prehistoric times by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].\n\n''Diospyros virginiana'' grows through {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}}, in well-drained soil. In summer, this species produces fragrant flowers which are [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], so one must have both male and female plants to obtain fruit. Most cultivars are [[parthenocarpic]] (setting seedless fruit without pollination). The flowers are [[Pollination|pollinated]] by insects and wind. Fruiting typically begins when the tree is about 6 years old.\n\nThe fruit is round or oval and usually orange-yellow, sometimes bluish, and from 2 to 6&nbsp;cm (0.79 to 2.4 in) in diameter. In the U.S. South and Midwest, the fruits are referred to as simply persimmons or \"'simmons\", and are popular in desserts and cuisine.\n\nCommercial varieties include the very productive Early Golden, the productive John Rick, Miller, Woolbright and the Ennis, a seedless variety. Another nickname of the American persimmon, 'date-plum' also refers to a persimmon species found in South Asia, ''[[Diospyros lotus]]''.\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Persimmon.jpg|thumb|left|American persimmon tree bearing fruit in the fall]]\n[[File:Persimmon 0375.jpg|thumb|right|Flower]]\nIt is a small tree usually 30 through 80 feet (10 through 24 meters) in height, with a short, slender trunk and spreading, often pendulous branches, which form a broad or narrow, round-topped canopy.

In the male flowers, which are numerous, the stamens are sixteen in number and arranged in pairs; the female flowers are solitary, with traces of stamens, and a smooth ovary with one ovule in each of the eight cells\u2014the ovary is surmounted by four styles, which are hairy at the base. The fruit-stalk is very short, bearing a [[subglobose]] fruit an inch in diameter or a bit larger, of an orange-yellow color, ranging to bluish, and with a sweetish astringent pulp.  It is surrounded at the base by the persistent calyx-lobes, which increase in size as the fruit ripens.  The astringency renders the fruit somewhat unpalatable, but after it has been subjected to the action of frost, or has become partially rotted or \"[[bletting|bletted]]\" like a [[medlar]], its flavor is improved.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Persimmon |inline=1 |volume=21 |page=252}}</ref>\n* Bark: Dark brown or dark gray, deeply divided into plates whose surface is scaly.  Branchlets slender, zigzag, with thick pith or large pith cavity; at first light reddish brown and pubescent.  They vary in color from light brown to ashy gray and finally become reddish brown, the bark somewhat broken by longitudinal fissures.  Astringent and bitter.\n* Wood: Very dark; sapwood yellowish white; heavy, hard, strong and very close grained.  Specific gravity, 0.7908; weight of cubic foot, {{convert|49.28|lb|abbr=on}}.  The heartwood is a true [[ebony]].  Forestry texts indicate that about a century of growth is required before a tree will produce a commercially viable yield of ebony wood.\n* Winter buds: Ovate, acute, one-eighth of an inch long, covered with thick reddish or purple scales.  These scales are sometimes persistent at the base of the branchlets.\n* Leaves: Alternate, simple, four to six inches (152&nbsp;mm)  long, oval, narrowed or rounded or cordate at base, entire, acute or acuminate.  They come out of the bud revolute, thin, pale, reddish green, downy with ciliate margins, when full grown are thick, dark green, shining above, pale and often pubescent beneath.  In autumn they sometimes turn orange or scarlet, sometimes fall without change of color.  Midrib broad and flat, primary veins opposite and conspicuous.  Petioles stout, pubescent, one-half to an inch in length.\n* Flowers: May, June, when leaves are half-grown; di\u0153cious or rarely polygamous.  Staminate flowers borne in two to three-flowered cymes; the pedicels downy and bearing two minute bracts.  Pistillate flowers solitary, usually on separate trees, their pedicels short, recurved, and bearing two bractlets.\n* Calyx: Usually four-lobed, accrescent under the fruit.\n* Corolla: Greenish yellow or creamy white, tubular, four-lobed; lobes imbricate in bud.\n* Stamens: Sixteen, inserted on the corolla, in staminate flowers in two rows.  Filaments short, slender, slightly hairy; anthers oblong, introrse, two-celled, cells opening longitudinally.  In pistillate flowers the stamens are eight with aborted anthers, rarely these stamens are perfect.\n* Pistil: Ovary superior, conical, ultimately eight-celled; styles four, slender, spreading; stigma two-lobed.\n* Fruit: A juicy berry containing one to eight seeds, crowned with the remnants of the style and seated in the enlarged calyx; depressed-globular, pale orange color, often red-cheeked; with slight bloom, turning yellowish brown after freezing.  Flesh astringent while green, sweet and luscious when ripe.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n\n\n==Distribution==\nThe tree is very common in the South Atlantic and Gulf states, and attains its largest size in the basin of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref name=EB1911 /> Its habitat is southern, it appears along the coast from [[Connecticut]] to [[Florida]]; west of the Alleghenies it is found in southern [[Ohio]] and along through southeastern [[Iowa]] and southern [[Missouri]]; when it reaches [[Louisiana]], eastern Kansas and Oklahoma it becomes a mighty tree, one hundred  fifteen feet high.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nIts fossil remains have been found in [[Miocene]] rocks of Greenland and Alaska and in [[Cretaceous]] formations in Nebraska.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n''Diospyros virginiana'' is believed to be an evolutionary remnant that was consumed by the  megafauna that roamed the North American continent until 10,000 years ago and would have eaten the fruit, assisting in its dispersal. However, as it is attractive to raccoons, rodents, and smaller animals, the loss of large grazing herbivores and omnivores in historical times has not seriously affected the tree's survival strategy as compared to [[Kentucky Coffeetree]] and [[Osage Orange]] which are inedible to most extant wildlife and saw their ranges greatly diminish without [[mastodon]]s and other dispersal agent fauna.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  A 2015 study supports the notion that elephants would have been a more effective disperser of the seeds than living North American mammals <ref>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1656/058.014.0109</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nThe peculiar characteristics of its fruit have made the tree well known.  This fruit is a globular berry, with variation in the number of seeds, sometimes with eight and sometimes without any.  It bears at its apex the remnants of the styles and sits in the enlarged and persistent calyx.  It ripens in late autumn, is pale orange with a red cheek, often covered with a slight glaucous bloom.  One joke among Southerners is to induce strangers to taste unripe persimmon fruit, as its very astringent bitterness is shocking to those unfamiliar with it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  Folklore states that frost is required to make it edible, but fully ripened fruit lightly shaken from the tree or found on the ground below the tree is sweet, juicy and delicious.  The peculiar astringency of the fruit is due to the presence of a tannin similar to that of ''[[Cinchona]]''.  The seeds were used as buttons during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BeA1AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA234&dq=persimmon+seed+buttons&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vQ27UZeGL8bw0QGGjoCIDg&ved=0CEgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=persimmon%20seed%20buttons&f=false|title=Domestic Economy in the Confederacy|first=David|last=Dodge|year=1886|journal=The Atlantic Monthly |volume=58|issue=August|pages=229\u2013241}}</ref>\n\nThe fruit is high in [[vitamin C]]. The unripe fruit is extremely [[astringent]]. The ripe fruit may be eaten raw, cooked or dried. [[Molasses]] can be made from the fruit pulp. A [[Herbal tea|tea]] can be made from the leaves and the roasted seed is used as a [[coffee]] substitute. Other popular uses include desserts such as persimmon [[pie]], [[persimmon pudding]], or [[persimmon candy]].\n\nThe fruit is also fermented with [[hops]], [[cornmeal]] or [[wheat bran]] into a sort of beer or made into brandy.  The wood is heavy, strong and very close-grained and used in [[woodturning]].<ref name=EB1911 />\n\n==Cultivation==\nThe tree prefers light, sandy, well-drained soil, but will grow in rich, southern, bottom lands.  It can be grown in northern Ohio only with the greatest of care, and in southern Ohio its fruit is never edible until after frost.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nThe tree is greatly inclined to vary in the character and quality of its fruit, in size this varies from that of a large cherry to a small apple.  Some trees in the south produce fruit that is delicious without the action of the frost, while adjoining trees produce fruit that never becomes edible.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nIt was brought to England before 1629 and is cultivated, but rarely if ever ripens its fruit.  It is easily raised from seed and can also be propagated from [[stolon]]s, which are often produced in great quantity.  The tree is hardy in the south of England and in the Channel Islands.<ref name=EB1911 />\n\nIn respect to the power of making [[heartwood]], the persimmon rarely develops any heartwood until it is nearly one hundred years old.  This heartwood is extremely close-grained and almost black, resembling [[ebony]] (of which it is a true variety).<ref name=Keeler /><ref>The ebony of commerce is derived from five different tropical species of the genus, two from [[India]] and one each from [[Africa]], [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] and [[Mauritius]].  The beautiful variegated [[Calamander wood|coromandel wood]] is the product of a species found in [[Ceylon]].</ref>\n\nIt is a common misconception persimmon fruit needs frost to ripen and soften, called [[bletting]]. Some, such as the early-ripening varieties \"pieper\" and \"NC21\"(also known as \"supersweet\"), easily lose astringency and become completely free of it when slightly soft at the touch\u2014these are then very sweet, even in the British climate. On the other hand, some varieties (like the very large fruited \"yates\", which is a late ripening variety) remain astringent even when the fruit has become completely soft (at least in the British climate). Frost, however, destroys the cells within the fruit, causing it to rot instead of ripen. Only completely ripe and soft fruit can stand some frost; it will then dry and become even sweeter (hence the misconception). The same goes for the Oriental persimmon (''[[Diospyros kaki]]''), where early frost can severely damage a fruit crop.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikispecies}}\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=divi5 USDA Plants Profile for ''Diospyros virginiana'' (common persimmon)]\n*[http://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=DIVI5 Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center\u2014Native Plant Information Network (NPIN): ''Diospyros virginiana'' (Common persimmon, Eastern persimmon)]\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/divi5.htm Bioimages.vanderbilt.edu: ''Diospyros virginiana'' images]\n*[http://www.persimmonpudding.com Persimmonpudding.com - dedicated to growing, education, and use of ''Diospyros virginiana'', the Common or American persimmon]\n*[http://www.treetrail.net/diospyros.html Treetrail.net: ''Diospyros virginiana'' (American Persimmon) Native Range Distribution Map]\n{{Commons category|position=left}}\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n[[Category:Diospyros|virginiana]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Crops originating from the United States]]\n[[Category:Dioecious plants]]\n[[Category:Plants used in Native American cuisine]]\n[[Category:Native American cuisine of the Southeastern Woodlands]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]",

The genus name ''[[wikt:fagus#Latin|Fagus]]'' is [[Latin]] for \"beech\", and the species name ''[[wikt:grandifolius#Latin|grandifolia]]'' comes from ''grandis'' \"large\" and ''folium'' \"leaf\".\n\n==Distribution and varieties==\nThe American beech is native to eastern [[North America]], from [[Nova Scotia]] west to [[Southern Ontario|southern]] [[Ontario]] in southeastern [[Canada]], west to [[Wisconsin]] and south to eastern [[Texas]] and northern [[Florida]] in the [[United States]].\n\nTrees in the southern half of the range are sometimes distinguished as a variety, ''F. grandifolia'' var. ''caroliniana'', but this is not considered distinct in the Flora of North America. The Mexican beech (''Fagus mexicana''), native to the mountains of central [[Mexico]], is closely related, and is sometimes treated as a subspecies of American beech, but more often as a distinct species. The only ''Fagus'' species found in the Western Hemisphere (assuming ''F. mexicana'' is treated as a subspecies), ''F. grandifolia'' is believed to have spanned the width of the North American continent all the way to the Pacific coast before the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]].\n\n== Description ==\nIt is a [[deciduous]] [[tree]] growing to {{convert|20|-|35|m|abbr=on}} tall, with smooth, silver-gray [[bark]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] are dark green, simple and sparsely-toothed with small teeth that terminate each vein, {{convert|6|-|12|cm|abbr=on}} long (rarely {{convert|15|cm}}), with a short [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]. The winter twigs are distinctive among North American trees, being long and slender ({{convert|15|-|20|mm|abbr=on}} by {{convert|2|-|3|mm|abbr=on}}) with two rows of overlapping scales on the buds. Beech buds are distinctly thin and long, resembling cigars; this characteristic makes beech trees relatively easy to identify. The tree is [[plant sexuality|monoecious]], with flowers of both sexes on the same tree. The [[fruit]] is a small, sharply-angled [[nut (fruit)|nut]], borne in pairs in a soft-spined, four-lobed husk. It has two means of reproduction: one is through the usual dispersal of seedlings, and the other is through root sprouts (new trees sprout from the roots in different locations).<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Emad |last1=Farahat |first2=Martin J. |last2=Lechowicz |title=Functional Ecology of Growth in Seedlings Versus root Sprouts of Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. |journal=Trees |year=2013 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=337\u2013340 |doi=10.1007/s00468-012-0781-9}}</ref>\n\nThe American beech is a shade-tolerant species, favoring shade more than other trees{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}, commonly found in forests in the final stage of [[Ecological succession|succession]]. Ecological succession is essentially the process of forests changing their composition through time; it is a pattern of events often observed on disturbed sites.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Horn|first=Henry S.| doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.05.110174.000325 \n| title = The Ecology of Secondary Succession \n| journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics \n| volume = 5 \n| pages = 25\u201337 \n| year = 1974 }}</ref> Although sometimes found in pure stands, it is more often associated with [[sugar maple]] (forming the [[Beech-maple forest|beech-maple climax community]]), [[Yellow Birch|yellow birch]], and [[Eastern hemlock]], typically on moist well drained slopes and rich bottomlands. Near its southern limit, it often shares canopy dominance with [[Magnolia grandiflora|Southern Magnolia]]. Although it has a reputation for slow growth (sometimes only 13 feet in 20 years), rich soil and ample moisture will greatly speed the process up. American beech favors a well-watered, but also well-drained spot and is intolerant of urban pollution, salt, and soil compaction. It also casts dense shade and has an extensive network of shallow, fibrous surface roots that make gardening underneath it almost impossible. Because American beech needs plenty of moisture and rich soil to thrive, it naturally occurs in bottomland forests. Early settlers often looked for beeches as a sign of a good potential place to clear the forest for farming.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFagus grandifolia, beltsville, md 2014-04-16-16.01.20 ZS PMax (13902703865).jpg|The long and thin winter bud of a beech\nFagus grandifolia beech leaves close.jpg|Spring leaves\nFile:2014-10-30 13 24 34 American Beech foliage during autumn in the woodlands along the West Branch Shabakunk Creek in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|Autumn foliage\nAmerican Beech.jpg|Beech leaf and nut\n2014-12-30 12 23 58 American Beech sapling in the woods near Metzger Drive at the College of New Jersey in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|In the winter, some fall leaves stay on beech trees ([[marcescence]])\nFile:American Beech Fagus grandifolia Bark.JPG|Bark\nFile:American Beech Fagus grandifolia Feet.JPG|The foot of the tree\n</gallery>\n\n== Disease ==\n[[Beech bark disease]] has become a major killer of beech trees in the Northeastern United States. This disease occurs when the beech scale insect, ''[[Cryptococcus fagisuga]]'', attacks the bark, creating a wound that is then infected by one of two different species of [[Fungus|fungi]] in the genus ''[[Nectria]]''. This causes a canker to develop and the tree is eventually killed.\n\n[[Beech blight aphid]]s colonize branches of the tree, but without serious harm to otherwise healthy trees. Below these colonies, deposits of [[sooty mold]] develop caused by the fungus ''[[Scorias spongiosa]]'' growing [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophytically]] on the [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]] the insects exude. This is also harmless to the trees.<ref>[http://tomvolkfungi.net/ Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month]</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:American Beech Fagus grandilolia Trunk.JPG|thumb|right|A carving in the bark of the tree]]\nAmerican beech is an important tree in [[forestry]]. The wood is heavy, hard, tough and strong, and until the advent of power tools in the 20th century, lumbering beech trees were often left uncut to grow. As a result, many areas today still have extensive groves of old beeches that would not otherwise occur. Today, the wood is harvested for uses such as flooring, containers, furniture, handles and woodenware.\n\nLike [[European beech]] bark, the American beech bark is smooth and uniform, making it an attraction for vandals to carve names, dates, gang symbols, and other material into its surface.<ref>David Martin, [http://www.dcdave.com/poet15/091130.htm Smooth Bark Compulsion]</ref> One such beech tree in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], in what is now the southern part of [[Iroquois Park]], bore the legend \"[[Daniel Boone|D. Boone]] kilt a [[bear|bar]]\" and the year in the late 18th century. This carving was first reported in the 19th century, but is believed to have not been produced by Boone since he was an educated man who would not have written something so semi-literate. The beech finally fell over in 1916 during a storm; its age was estimated at around 325 years. Its trunk is now on display at [[The Filson Historical Society]].\n\nIt is sometimes planted as an ornamental tree, but even within its native area, it is planted much less often than the European beech. Although American beech can handle hotter climates,<ref>Gardening with Native Plants of the South by Sally and Andy Wasowski, p.44</ref> its European variant is faster-growing and more pollution-tolerant, in addition to being easier to propagate.\n\nAmerican beech can take up to 40 years to begin producing seeds. Large crops are produced by 60 years and the tree's total lifespan may be up to 300 years. The fruit is a triangle-shaped shell containing 2-3 nuts inside, but many of them do not fill in, especially on solitary trees. Beech nuts are edible to humans, although too small to be commercially valuable.\n\nThe [[mast (botany)|mast]] (crop of nuts) from American beech provides food for numerous species of animals. Among [[vertebrate]]s alone, these include ruffed grouse, wild turkeys, raccoons, red/gray foxes, white-tailed deer, rabbits, squirrels, opossums, pheasants, black bears, porcupines, and humans. For [[lepidoptera]]n [[caterpillar]]s feeding on American beech, see [[list of Lepidoptera that feed on beeches]]. Beech nuts were one of the primary foods of the now-extinct [[passenger pigeon]]; the clearing of beech and [[oak]] forests are pointed to as one of the major factors that may have contributed to the bird's extinction.<ref>[http://rmmc.asu.edu/abstracts/nrm/vol18-4/conrpag1.pdf] Jon M.

This resin-impregnated [[heartwood]] becomes hard and rot-resistant. The [[Tree stump|stump]] (and [[tap root]]) left in the ground after a tree has fallen or has been cut is an excellent source of fatwood. Other locations, such as the joints where limbs intersect the trunk, can also be harvested.  Although most resinous pines can produce fatwood, in the southeastern United States the wood is commonly associated with [[Pinus palustris|longleaf pine]] (''Pinus palustris''), which historically was highly valued for its high [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] production.\n\n==History==\nThe commercial use of fatwood from stumps stemmed from its use to make [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and [[pine tar]]. In 1648, a company was formed in [[Sweden]] called ''Norrl\u00e4ndska Tj\u00e4rkompaniet'' (The Wood Tar Company of North Sweden), and was given exclusive export rights[for pinetar - see separate topic- not fatwood] by the [[King of Sweden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritime.org/conf/conf-kaye-tar.htm |title=Pine Tar; History And Uses |publisher=Maritime.org |date=1997-07-07 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\nConiferous tree sap is a [[Viscosity|viscous]] [[liquid]], that contains [[terpene]], a [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[hydrocarbon]]. Over time the [[evaporation]] of the terpene changes the state of the sap; it slowly gets thicker until it hardens into [[resin]]. New fatwood leaks the sticky sap, while in aged fatwood the sap has hardened and is no longer sticky. At every stage of the aging process, fatwood will burn readily, even when wet.\n\n==Wood kindling and tinder==\nBecause of the flammability of terpene, fatwood is prized for use as kindling in starting fires. It lights quickly even when wet, is very wind resistant, and burns hot enough to light larger pieces of wood. A small piece of fatwood can be used many times to create tinder by shaving small curls and using them to light other larger tinder. In [[Louisiana]] \"fatwood\" is known as \"rich lighter\" and cut slivers are what is referred to as \"kindling\" because of the abundance{{clarification needed|date=December 2016}}. The pitch-soaked wood produces an oily, sooty smoke, and it is recommended{{by whom?|date=December 2016}} that one should not cook on a fire until all the fatwood has completely burned out.  The smoke produced by \"fatwood\" is considered{{by whom?|date=December 2016}} to be an excellent bug (especially [[mosquito]]) [[Insect repellent|repellent]] (although this is unproven).\n\n==Distribution==\nThere are between 105 and 125 [[species]] classified as [[resin]]ous [[Pine|pine trees]] around the world. Species usable for fatwood are distributed across a range including Eurasia, where they range from the Canary Islands, Iberian Peninsula and Scotland east to the Russian Far East. From the Philippines, Norway, Finland and Sweden (Scots Pine), and eastern Siberia (Siberian Dwarf Pine), and south to northernmost Africa. From the Himalaya and Southeast Asia, with one species (Sumatran Pine) just crossing the Equator in Sumatra,. In North America, they range from 66\u00b0N in Canada (Jack Pine), to [[Central America]] to 12\u00b0N in Nicaragua (Caribbean Pine). The highest diversity in the genus occurs in Mexico and California. In the sub-tropics of the Southern Hemisphere, including Chile, Brazil, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and New Zealand, where the trees are not [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] but were introduced. Anywhere there is a pine tree or pine [[Tree stump|stump]], there can be fatwood that can be found on top of the ground, but is more concentrated and preserved in stumps.\n\n===The United States===\nIn the United States the pine tree, ''[[Pinus palustris]]'', known as the Longleaf pine, once covered as much as  {{convert|90000000|acre|km2}} but due to [[clear cutting]] was reduced by between 95% and 97%. The trees grow very large (up to 150 feet), taking 100 to 150 years to mature and can live up to 500 years. The wood was prized and cutting resulted in many hundreds of thousands of stumps that are very resinous, do not rot, and eventually become fatwood. This ushered in a new industry for many years. There is still a market for the wood, but supplies are less abundant. Due to the length of growing time, the ''[[Pinus taeda]]'', also called the Loblolly pine, replaced it for commercial replanting, with a maturity of only 38 to 45 years.\n\n==Industrial uses==\nIndustrial uses for fatwood include production of [[turpentine]]; when fatwood is cooked down in a fire kiln, the heavier resin product that results is [[pine tar]]. The [[steam]] that vaporizes from this process is turned into a liquid that becomes turpentine.\n\n===Other uses===\nTree resins or by-products are used in many different things to include;\n*Household chemicals especially for cleaning such as turpentine and pine oil.\n*Nail polish\n*medical to include dental\n*Cutler's resin is still used in making knife handles.\n\n==See also==\n[[Sugartown, Louisiana]]\n[[Beauregard Parish, Louisiana]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{Commonscat}}\n* [http://www.napoleum.de/levb/LEVB%20Das%20Beleuchtungswesen.pdf Ladislaus E.v.

It is commercially available for garden cultivation. It is prized for its lightly fragrant white flowers, similar to single white ''[[Camellia]]'' blossoms; the smell may remind some of orange blossoms or [[honeysuckle]].  The tree has a symmetrical, somewhat pyramidal shape, often with different individuals of the species forming almost identical crowns. It frequently suckers and can form several vertical trunks close to ground level. The bark is gray with vertical white striations and has a ridged texture. The alternate, obovate leaves are up to {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} in length and turn a bright orange-red in the fall. Although difficult to [[transplanting|transplant]], once established, ''F. alatamaha''  can live a century or more.\n\n''Franklinia alatamaha''  fruit develop slowly. The [[capsule (botany)|seed capsules]] require 12\u201314 months to mature. When ripe the pentavalved spherical capsules [[dehiscence (botany)|split]] above and below in a unique manner. Anecdotal evidence suggests viable seed production is enhanced where two or more plants are present in close proximity.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:William Bartram01.jpg|thumb|left|''Franklinia alatamaha'' by William Bartram (1782)]]\n[[Philadelphia]] botanists [[John Bartram|John]] and [[William Bartram]] first observed the tree growing along the [[Altamaha River]] near Fort Barrington in the British colony of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in October 1765. John Bartram recorded \"severall very curious shrubs\" in his journal entry for October 1, 1765. William Bartram returned several times to the same location on the Altamaha during a collecting trip to the American South, funded by Dr. John Fothergill of London. William Bartram collected ''F. alatamaha''  [[seed]]s during this extended trip to the South from 1773 through 1776, a journey described in his book ''[[Bartram's Travels]]'' published in Philadelphia in 1791. William Bartram brought seed back to Philadelphia in 1777 at which time William reported to his father that he had relocated the plant, but this time had been able to retrieve its seeds although it was not until after John's death (1777) that he was able to achieve flowering plants (1781). After several years of study, William Bartram assigned the \u201crare and elegant flowering shrub\u201d  to a new genus ''Franklinia'', named in honor of his father's great friend [[Benjamin Franklin]]. The new plant name, ''Franklinia alatamaha'', was first published by a Bartram cousin, Humphry Marshall, in 1785 in his catalogue of North American trees and shrubs entitled ''Arbustrum Americanum.'' (Marshall 1785: 48-50; Fry 2001).\n\nWilliam Bartram was the first to report the extremely limited distribution of ''Franklinia''. \"We never saw it grow in any other place, nor have I ever since seen it growing wild, in all my travels, from Pennsylvania to Point Coupe, on the banks of the Mississippi, which must be allowed a very singular and unaccountable circumstance; at this place there are two or {{convert|3|acre|m2}} of ground where it grows plentifully.\" (W. Bartram 1791: 468).\n\nThe tree was last verified in the wild in 1803 by the English plant collector John Lyon, (although there are hints it may have been present into at least the 1840s.).<ref>Bozeman, John R. and George A. Rogers. 1986. \u201c\u2018This very curious tree\u2019: Despite years of searching and research the enigma of ''Franklinia alatamaha'' endures,\u201d'' Tipularia'', (November), p. 9-15.</ref> The cause of its extinction in the wild is not known, but has been attributed to a number of causes including fire, flood, overcollection by plant collectors, and [[fungus|fungal]] [[disease]] introduced with the cultivation of [[cotton]] plants.<ref>Dirr, Michael A. 1998. Manual of Woody Landscape Plants: Their Identification, Ornamental Characteristics, Culture, Propagation and Uses. Stipes Publishing L.L.C.: Champaign, IL.</ref>\n\nAll the Franklin trees known to exist today are descended from seed collected by William Bartram and propagated at [[Bartram's Garden]] in Philadelphia. It has now been cultivated in excess of 1000 sites worldwide.<ref>Bartram's Garden (Philadelphia, Pa., USA), \"The Franklinia Story,\" http://www.bartramsgarden.org/franklinia/index.html, accessed 1 July 2007.</ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\nThe Franklin tree has a reputation among gardeners for being difficult to cultivate, especially in urban environments. It prefers sandy, high-acid soil, and does not tolerate compacted clay soil, excessive moisture, or any disturbance to its roots. The Franklin tree has no known pests, but it is subject to a root-rot disease and does not endure drought well.<ref>U.S. Forest Service, \"Franklinia Alatamaha, Franklin-Tree,\" Fact Sheet ST-260, November 1993.</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Franklin Tree Franklinia alatamaha Leaves 3008px.JPG|Leaves\nImage:Franklin Tree Franklinia alatamaha Leaf Closeup 3008px.JPG|Leaf closeup\nImage:Franklin Tree Franklinia alatamaha Trunk 2000px.JPG|Trunk bark\nImage:Franklin Tree Franklinia alatamaha Autumn Leaf 2000px.jpg|Fall leaves\nImage:Franklinia alatamaha seeds.jpg|Fruit capsule\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{commons category|Franklinia alatamaha}}\n{{wikispecies|Franklinia alatamaha}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Bartram, William. 1791.

The crown is conical, with straight branches either horizontal or angled upward at 40\u00b0 from the trunk; it is dense when the tree is young and more open in maturity. The [[bark]] is thin, smooth, grayish brown, and has numerous [[resin]]ous blisters on juvenile trees, becoming fissured and scaly in maturity.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like; arranged spirally on the twigs but twisted at their bases to form 2 rows on each twig; they are 0.4-0.9&nbsp;inches (10\u201323&nbsp;mm) long and 79-87 [[mil (imperial)|mil]] (2\u20132.2&nbsp;mm) broad; flat; flexible; rounded or slightly notched at their apices (tips); dark to glaucous green adaxially (above); often having a small patch of [[stoma]]ta near their apices; and having 2 silvery white stomatal bands abaxially (on their undersides). Their strong fragrance resembles [[turpentine]].\n\nThe [[Conifer cone|cones]] are erect; cylindrical; 1.4 to 2.75&nbsp;inches (3.5\u20137&nbsp;cm) long, rarely 3.2&nbsp;in (8&nbsp;cm), and 1-1.2&nbsp;inches (2.5\u20133&nbsp;cm) broad, rarely 1.5&nbsp;in (4&nbsp;cm) broad; dark purple, turning pale brown when mature; often resinous; and with long reflexed green, yellow, or pale purple [[bract]] scales. The cones disintegrate when mature at 4\u20136 months old to release the winged seeds.<ref name=farjon/><ref name=liu/><ref name=fna/>\n\nSome botanists regard the variety of [[Balsam fir]] named Abies balsamea var. phanerolepis as a natural [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] with Fraser fir, denominated ''Abies \u00d7 phanerolepis'' (Fernald) Liu.<ref name=liu/>\n\n==Ecology==\n\n===Reproduction and Growth===\nFraser fir is monoecious, meaning that both male and female flowers (strobili) occur on the same tree.<ref>[http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/Volume_1/abies/fraseri.htm Abies fraseri (Pursh) Poir], Silviculture Manual, Volume 1, US Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Retrieved 20 October 2014</ref> Flower buds usually open from mid-May to early June. Female flowers are borne mostly in the top few feet of the crown and on the distal ends of branches. Male flowers are borne below female flowers, but mostly in the upper half of the crown. Seed production may begin when trees are 15 years old. Seeds germinate well on mineral soil, moss, peat, decaying stumps and logs, and even on detritus or litter that is sufficiently moist.<ref>[http://www.realchristmastrees.org/dnn/education/treevarieties/fraserfir.aspx Abies fraseri (Pursh) Poir.] The National Christmas Tree Association, Retrieved 20 Oct 2014</ref>\n\n===Distribution===\n[[Image:Abies fraseri0.jpg|left|thumb|Fraser fir forest, with many trees killed by [[balsam woolly adelgid]]]]\nThe Fraser fir, ''Abies fraseri'', is restricted to the southeastern [[Appalachian Mountains]] in southwestern [[Virginia]], western [[North Carolina]] and eastern [[Tennessee]], where it occurs at high elevations, from 3,900 feet to the summit of [[Mount Mitchell (North Carolina)|Mount Mitchell]], the highest point in the region at 6,683 feet (1,200 m up to 2,037 m). It lives in acidic moist but well-drained sandy loam, and is usually mixed with ''[[Picea rubens]]'' (red spruce). Other trees it grows with include ''[[Tsuga caroliniana]]'' (Carolina hemlock), ''[[Betula alleghaniensis]]'' (yellow birch), ''[[Betula papyrifera]]'' (paper birch), and ''[[Acer saccharum]]'' (sugar maple). The climate is cool and moist, with short, cool summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall.<ref name=farjon/><ref name=liu/>\n\n===Pests===\n''Abies fraseri'' is severely damaged by a non-native insect, the [[balsam woolly adelgid]] (''Adelges piceae''). The insect's introduction and spread led to a rapid decline in Fraser fir across its range, with over 80 percent of mature trees having been killed. The rapid regeneration of seedlings with lack of canopy has led to good regrowth of healthy young trees where the mature forests once stood. However, when these young trees get old enough for the bark to develop fissures, they may be attacked and killed by the adelgids as well.\n\nFor this reason, the future of the species is still uncertain, though the Mount Rogers (Virginia) population has largely evaded adelgid mortality. The decline of the Fraser fir in the southern Appalachians has contributed to loss of moss habitat which supports the [[spruce-fir moss spider]].<ref name=gd/>\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\nAlthough not important as a source of timber, Fraser fir is widely used as a [[Christmas tree]]. Its mild fragrance, shape, strong limbs, and ability to retain its soft needles (which do not prick easily when hanging ornaments) for a long time when cut make it one of the best trees for this purpose.<ref>Hendrix, Steve, \"[http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/the-remarkable-journey-of-a-single-christmas-tree/2011/12/01/gIQALVuZ9O_story.html A Christmas tree\u2019s remarkable journey]\", ''The Washington Post'', December 21, 2011.</ref> Fraser fir has been used more times as the [[White House Christmas tree]] (the official Christmas tree of the [[President of the United States|President of the United States's]] [[White House]]) than any other tree.{{citation needed|date = February 2012}}\n\nIt is grown in plantations in [[Scotland]] and sold by the thousands throughout the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]].{{citation needed|date = February 2012}} It is also cultivated from seedlings in several northern states in the USA and adjacent parts of Quebec province, especially for the Christmas tree trade.{{citation needed|date = February 2012}}\n\nThe combination of form, needle retention, dark blue-green color, pleasant scent and excellent shipping characteristics has led to Fraser fir being a most popular [[Christmas tree]] species. Growing and harvesting this species for Christmas trees and boughs is a multimillion-dollar business in the southern [[Appalachians]]. North Carolina produces the majority of Fraser fir Christmas trees.<ref>[http://www.ncagr.gov/ Fraser Fir] North Carolina Department of Agriculture.

The damage of this insect rivals that of [[Chestnut blight]] and [[Dutch Elm Disease]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Bruce Schlink|title=Americans Held Hostage by the Environmentalist Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mkXBaIFpuAC&pg=PA494&lpg=PA4940|year=2012|publisher=Dorrance Publishing|page=494|isbn=978-1-4349-7536-2}}</ref> To put its damage in perspective, the number of [[chestnuts]] killed by the [[Chestnut blight]] was around 3.5 billion chestnut trees while there are 3.5 billion ash trees in [[Ohio]] alone. [[Dutch Elm Disease]] killed only 200 million elm trees while EAB threatens 7.5 billion ash trees in the United States. The insect threatens the entire North American genus ''Fraxinus'', while past invasive tree pests have only threatened a single species within a genus. Since its accidental introduction into the United States and Canada in the 1990s, and its subsequent detection in 2002, it has spread to eleven states and adjacent parts of Canada. It has killed at least 50 million ash trees so far and threatens to kill most of the ash trees throughout North America. The green ash and the black ash trees are affected. White ash is also killed rapidly, but usually only after green and black ash trees are eliminated. Blue ash displays some resistance to the emerald ash borer by forming callous tissue around EAB galleries; however, they are usually killed. White ash has been less affected by emerald ash borer due to its small population (unlike its cousin, ''F. americana'' is not commonly seen in cultivation) compared to green ash, which was planted in huge numbers as an ornamental.<ref>[http://joa.isa-arbor.com/request.asp?JournalID=1&ArticleID=3011&Type=2 Andrea C.

Its fall foliage is yellow. Black ash is one of the first trees to lose its leaves in the fall.  It is very closely related to [[Fraxinus mandschurica|Manchurian ash]], and will easily hybridize with it. Some consider the two to be geographic isolates of each other.\n\nBlack ash is a food plant for the [[larva]]e of several species of [[Lepidoptera]]; see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on ashes]].\n\nThe species was considered abundant and its survival of little concern prior to the invasion of the [[emerald ash borer]], first detected in North America in 2002.  However, since that time this invasive insect has spread throughout most of the tree's range, and within a few years black ash is expected to be all but extirpated; a similar fate awaits green ash.  In 2014, a U.S. Forest Service agent estimated that \"ninety-nine percent of the ashes in North America are probably going to die.\"  [[Blue ash]] and [[white ash]] are only slightly less affected.<ref>{{cite newspaper |title=After the Trees Disappear |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=30 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\nThis wood is used by Native Americans of the North East for making baskets and other devices. The [[Shakers]] also made extensive use of the Black Ash for creating baskets. Also called Basket Ash, Brown Ash, Swamp Ash, hoop ash, and water ash.\nIt is also a popular wood for making electric guitars and basses, due to its good resonant qualities.<ref>[http://www.jemsite.com/jem/wood.htm Guitar Wood FAQ \u2013 Wood Types & Tones<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== Creating basket strips ==\n[[File:Kelly church black ash basket.jpg|thumb|left|Black ash splint basket by [[Kelly Church]] ([[Odawa]]-[[Ojibwe]])]]\nBlack ash is unique among all trees in North America in that it does not have fibers connecting the growth rings to each other. This is a useful property for basket makers. By pounding on the wood with a mallet, the weaker spring wood layer is crushed, allowing the tougher and darker summer wood layer to be peeled off in long strips. The long strips are trimmed, cleaned, and used in [[basket weaving]].

That epidemic was the result of a similar overuse of elms in urban environments, leading to a [[monoculture]] that lacked any disease or pest resistance. Scientifically for red ash this is because modern cultivars utilized regionally were parented from sometimes only four individual trees selected for unique traits and male seedless flowering. Proclaiming a harsh lesson learned, cities like Chicago did not replace dead elms with a 1:1 ash:elm ratio. Instead, Norway, silver, red and sugar maples, honey locust, linden/basswood, redbud, crabapples and hackberry, among others, were also utilized during this recovery period and in new urban and suburban areas. Fortunately, with these additional species, many cities were able to reduce the percent of ash and other species to much lower levels (20% average) than during the Dutch elm disease era where from 56% to 100% of the trees were elm.\n\nBoth American elm and green ash were extremely popular due to rapid growth and tolerance of urban pollution and road salt, so many housing developments in [[Michigan]] were lined from end to end with ashes, a result of which the beetles had an enormous food supply to boost their population well above Infestation thresholds. The tree was also extensively propagated and sold by local nurseries. According to the American Nursery Industry, \"Back in the late 1980s, Dr. Frank Santamour Jr., then a research geneticist with the U.S. National Arboretum, proposed the 10-20-30 formula for diversity in the urban forest, limiting the plantings in a community to no more than 10 percent within a single species, 20 percent within a genus and 30 percent within a family.\"\"\u00a0Because of EAB today, many communities  are using a more strict 20 -10-5 rule.\n\nThe emerald ash borer proved to be a far worse and potentially more serious threat than epidemics of the past such as chestnut blight and Dutch elm disease because those diseases spread at a slower rate, only affected one species, and did not kill the trees before they could attain reproductive maturity. Many areas have banned the sale of ash seedlings in nurseries, although seeds may be sold as they are not a vector for the insect.\n\n== Uses ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== Urban ornamental trees ===\n[[File:2014-10-29 13 12 58 Green Ash foliage during autumn coloration in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|thumb|right|Autumn leaf color]]\nGreen ash is one of the most widely planted [[ornamental plant|ornamental trees]] throughout the [[United States]] and much of [[Canada]] but mostly [[Alberta]], including in western areas where it is not native.

It is a member of the Tea or [[Theaceae]] family.  It is slow growing with soft, light-colored(Varies in color from Cream to Carmine), fine-grained wood of little commercial value, although loblolly-bay could be managed as a source of pulpwood.  When older specimens are cut, the wood exudes a strong scent.  It is similar to a mixture of fresh oranges and pine sap.  The bark of the adult tree varies from medium grey to a red brown coloration. Dead adult specimens of loblolly bay exhibit a lustorous shine when exposed to sunlight for several years.  The white showy flowers and shiny foliage make it a desirable ornamental, but it is not easy to cultivate. Deer browse stump sprouts heavily.\n\n==Habitat==\n\n===Native range===\nLoblolly-bay is continuously distributed along the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains from Coastal Southern Virginia to the Appalachicola River in the Florida Panhandle.  Discontinuous populations exist in Florida, the coastal counties of Alabama, and southern Mississippi. In South Carolina it is commonly found in the lower Coastal Plain, but in the middle and upper Coastal Plain it is restricted to specific sites.\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate over the range of loblolly-bay is characterized by mild winters and warm summers. Air temperature data, compiled from a weather atlas (8), are as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! Property\n! Northern extreme\n!

Annually there are from 110 to 120 days with only a trace of rainfall.\n\n==Soils and topography==\nIn North and South Carolina, loblolly-bay is apparently very soil-specific even though it is found on several soil series. It grows on certain [[Spodosol]]s, [[Inceptisol]]s, [[Ultisol]]s, and [[Histosol]]s and to a lesser degree on [[Entisol]]s and [[Mollisol]]s (7). Soil profiles of a loblolly-bay site in South Carolina have the following general characteristics at various [[soil horizon]]s:\n\n*A1- 0 to 25&nbsp;cm (0 to 10 in) black to dark gray, fine sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand, very strongly or extremely acid,\n*A2- 25 to 38&nbsp;cm (10 to 15 in ) black or gray, sand, loamy fine sand or sandy loam, very strongly or extremely acid (often there is no A2),\n*B- 38 to 51 to 127&nbsp;cm (15 to 20 to 50 in) gray or brown, sand to sandy loam, very strongly acid (often not present),\n*C- 51 to 127 to 175&nbsp;cm (20 to 50 to 69 in) gray or brown, sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand, strongly to very strongly acid.\n\nLoblolly-bay grows in flat woodlands or shallow depressions with little or no slope, slow runoff, rapid permeability, and poor to very poor drainage. In South Carolina the soils are usually of sandy coastal plain or marine origin, except for the organic soils. The water table is at or near the soil surface for 6 to 9 months of the year.\n\nIn South Carolina's lower Coastal Plain, loblolly-bay is found in wet flats and in bays, typically the Carolina Bays (11). In the upper and middle Coastal Plain, it is found mainly along the edges of Carolina Bays and is widely dispersed in wet, flat woodlands on certain soil types.\n\n===Associated forest cover===\nLoblolly-bay is found in five [[forest cover]] types (2) within the Atlantic Coastal Plain (9,10,11). Pondcypress (Society of American Foresters Type 100) is found in certain Carolina Bays with ponded water. Loblolly-bay is not found in the bay interior with [[pondcypress]] (''[[Taxodium distichum]]'' var. ''nutans''), probably because of the high water table; rather it is found along better drained margins. Here it is growing with loblolly pine (''[[Pinus taeda]]'') and redbay (''[[Persea borbonia]]'' var. ''borbonia'') in the overstory and fetterbush (''[[Lyonia lucida]]''), inkberry (''[[Ilex glabra]]''), and greenbrier (''[[Smilax]]'' spp.) in the understory.\n\nLoblolly-bay is a minor component of Loblolly Pine-Hardwood (Type 82) but cannot be found consistently. In the middle Coastal Plain of South Carolina, loblolly-bay is found with loblolly pine, water oak (''[[Quercus nigra]]''), sweetgum (''[[Liquidambar styraciflua]]''), American holly (''[[Ilex opaca]]''), redbay, longleaf pine (''[[Pinus palustris]]''), and yellow-poplar (''[[Liriodendron tulipifera]]''). Loblolly-bay is found only in the wetter areas of this forest cover type.\n\nLoblolly-bay is a minor component of Atlantic White-Cedar (Type 97), along with pond pine (''[[Pinus serotina]]''), swamp cyrilla (''[[Cyrilla racemiflora]]''), redbay, and sweetbay (''[[Magnolia virginiana]]'').\n\nPond Pine (Type 98) is the typical vegetation of wet flats and some Carolina Bays in South Carolina. Loblolly-bay, pond pine, sweetbay, and redbay are the tree species present, and they rarely form a closed canopy. The thick, shrub layer is composed of fetterbush, greenbrier vines, inkberry, and loblolly-bay.\n\nSweetbay-Swamp Tupelo-Redbay (Type 104) is the \"broadleaf evergreen forest\" of the lower Coastal Plain of North and South Carolina. Loblolly-bay is a minor component in the overstory along with red maple (''[[Acer rubrum]]''), black tupelo (''[[Nyssa sylvatica]]'' var. ''sylvatica''), sweetgum, and water oak.\n\n==Life history==\nThe information of this section is based on measurements and observations made in the northern Coastal Plain of South Carolina.\n\n===Reproduction and early growth===\n[[Image:GordoniaLasianthus21Jun03.jpg|thumb|left|''Gordonia lasianthus'' beginning to bloom, June, N. Florida]]\n\n''Flowering and fruiting-'' Flowers are perfect. Flower bud formation is visible by the time new leaves fully expand. The peduncle expands rapidly and the young bud slowly enlarges until it opens. Flower buds at the top of the tree open first. Flowers are first seen from the last week in June to the first week of July and may be seen until mid-August. Flowers remain open for 1 or 2 days and are pollinated by humble bees, thrips, flies, and hummingbirds. After the second day the sepals and petals fall, leaving the ovary at the end of the peduncle.\n\n''Seed production and dissemination-'' As the ovaries develop they gradually turn brown and five sutures develop. Mature, open capsules are first seen during September or October, and all of the capsules open by the middle of December. Seeds are shaken out of the capsules by the wind and empty capsules remain attached until peduncle and capsule abscission, which first occurs about the last of December and continues through the winter.\n\nSeedfall starts in October, peaks in December, and continues until the first of March. Loblolly-bay seeds are light (120,000 to 151,000/lb or 265,000 to 333,000/kg) and winged. Results from one study indicated that approximately 99 percent of the seeds produced fall within two tree heights of the source tree. This study also indicated that this distribution of seedfall is concentrated near the source tree, 60 percent of the seeds falling within a distance equal to one-half of the tree height, and 94 percent of the seeds falling within a distance equal to the tree height. Seedfall rates during a 2-year study varied from 2,600 to 273,000/ha (1,070 to 110,400/acre).\n\n''Seedling development-'' Seed germination in petri dishes in sunlight is high: 70 to 80 percent within 10 days. In a greenhouse heated at 13&nbsp;\u00b0C to 16&nbsp;\u00b0C (55&nbsp;\u00b0F to 60&nbsp;\u00b0F), similar germination percentages were obtained but up to 24 days were required. Germination is [[epigeal germination|epigeal]]. Very few seedlings have been observed in the field and most of those seen apparently do not live past the first season. Loblolly-bay seedlings seem to require relatively open conditions and exposed soil for establishment. Older seedlings have only been observed where the mineral soil has been disturbed such as in recently plowed fire lines.\n\nInitial growth of the seedlings is slow. Field observations indicated that by the end of the third growing season the seedlings were about 10 to 15&nbsp;cm (4 to 6 in) tall and by the eighth growing season they were only 30 to 40&nbsp;cm (12 to 16 in) high.\n\n''Vegetative reproduction-'' Vegetative propagation of first-year shoots in a peat and sand medium under mist is commonly used by horticulturists (1). In the field, vegetative regeneration appears to be more common than regeneration from seed. Stump sprouts may grow as much as 1 in (3&nbsp;ft) the first year after the tree is cut. These stump sprouts appear to be very attractive to deer and heavy browsing has been noticed.\n\nNumerous root-collar sprouts are produced when the trees are killed by fire (9) or if the root system is mechanically damaged by a logging or disking operation.\n\n===Sapling and pole stages to maturity===\n''Growth and yield-'' Early tree growth (ages 5 to 15 years) is relatively rapid. Height growth for the first 15 years averages 0.6 m/yr (2.0&nbsp;ft/yr), with a 10-year-old tree averaging 6.5 in (21.3&nbsp;ft) in height. These figures do not compare with the seedling's growth figures because growth and yield measurements were made on stems that were most probably sprouts. Early diameter growth at breast height is about 0.4&nbsp;cm/yr (0.2 in/yr), a 10-year-old tree being about 5.1 to 6.1&nbsp;cm (2.0 to 2.4 in) in d.b.h.\n\n''Rooting habit-'' The root system of loblolly-bay appears to reflect its strong tendency to reproduce by sprouting. A number of specimens examined had a large primary lateral root with secondary roots branching downward.\n\n''Reaction to competition-'' Loblolly-bay is classed as tolerant of shade. In bays and wet flats, where the tree cover is relatively light, loblolly-bay is a strong competitor. It generally increases in height faster than the pines on the adjacent upland. However, if loblolly-bay is overtopped, older trees will lose their characteristic conical shape and the crown will break up.\n\n''Damaging agents-'' Only two symptoms of insects or pathogens have been observed locally. Neither causal agent was identified. An ooze was noticed in a wound at the base of a mature tree, but otherwise the tree appeared healthy. An unknown grazing insect consumed all but the leaf veins of the late-season flush of leaves during August. Another noticeable sensitivity is to fire. The thin bark and shallow root system of loblolly-bay probably contribute to its low fire tolerance.  Dead wood is extremely susceptible to rotting and Fungi.\n\n==Special uses==\nLoblolly-bay has long been used by horticulturists in landscaping (1). Most research on loblolly-bay has been done by horticulturists interested in propagating it. In the Southeast, loblolly-bay is considered a handsome and hardy tree valued for its glossy dark-green leaves and abundant white flowers. Its wood has been used in cabinetmaking and its bark as a tanning agent (5). If the bark is steeped in warm water, it will dye both the container and water a rich carmine color.\n\nBecause of its ability to grow in wet bogs and flats where loblolly pine does poorly, loblolly-bay silviculture may offer a management alternative for such areas.\n\nLaboratory papermaking tests conducted recently and other results reported in the literature (3,4) indicate that the pulp yield from loblolly-bay was acceptable (52 percent), the bulk of the paper was low (1.46&nbsp;cm/g or 2.53 in/oz), and the strength acceptable. One laboratory test indicated a breaking length of 11,525 m (37,800&nbsp;ft), a tensile strength of 10.2 [[kgf]]/15&nbsp;mm (38.1 [[lbf]]/in), and a count of 836 folds using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology paper folding tester (1&nbsp;kg or 2.2&nbsp;lb). Although further testing needs to be done, these tests do not indicate any problems in making kraft paper from loblolly-bay pulp. Pulp mills in the lower Coastal Plain of South Carolina include loblolly-bay in their hardwood pulp.\n\n==Genetics==\nBecause loblolly-bay is the only native tree in the genus (6), there are no hybrids. No information could be found concerning the genetics of loblolly-bay.\n\n==Literature cited==\n*1. Bailey, L. H. 1928. Standard encyclopedia of horticulture. Vol 2. p.&nbsp;1361.

The [[bark]] is light brown, smooth, scaly, inner bark reddish purple. The branchlets are pubescent at first, later smooth, light orange brown, marked with occasional white dots, finally dark or reddish brown. The foliage buds are acute, slightly falcate, downy, light brown. The [[leaf|leaves]] are oval, 3.7\u201316.7&nbsp;cm long and 2.5\u201313&nbsp;cm broad, oblique at the base, acute or rounded at the apex, with a wavy-toothed or shallowly lobed margin, and a short, stout petiole 6\u201315&nbsp;mm long; the midrib is more or less hairy, stout, with six to seven pairs of primary veins. The young leaves open involute, covered with stellate rusty down; when full grown, they are dark green above, and paler beneath. In fall, they turn yellow with rusty spots. The leaf [[stipule]]s are lanceolate, acute; they fall soon after the leaf expands.\n\n[[File:Common Witch Hazel Hamamelis virginiana Leaf 2000px.jpg|left|upright|thumb|leaf closeup]]\n\nThe [[flower]]s are pale to bright yellow, rarely orange or reddish, with four ribbon-shaped [[petal]]s 10\u201320&nbsp;mm long and four short stamens, and grow in clusters; flowering begins in about mid-fall and continues until late fall. The flower [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]] is deeply four-parted, very downy, orange brown within, imbricate in bud, persistent, cohering with the base of the ovary. Two or three bractlets appear at base. The [[fruit]] is a hard woody [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]] 10\u201314&nbsp;mm long, which splits explosively at the apex at maturity one year after pollination, ejecting the two shiny black [[seed]]s up to 10 m distant from the parent plant. It can be distinguished from the related ''[[Hamamelis vernalis]]'' by its flowering in fall, not winter.<ref name=fna/><ref name=fna2>Flora of North America: [http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=114541 ''Hamamelis'']</ref><ref name=mp>Missouriplants: [http://www.missouriplants.com/Yellowalt/Hamamelis_virginiana_page.html ''Hamamelis'']</ref><ref name=Keeler>{{cite book |last=Keeler |first=H.L. |title=Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |date=1900 |location=New York |pages=157\u2013160}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Hamamelis virginiana 03.JPG|thumb|left| ''Hamamelis virginiana'', Flower and fruit]]\n\nNative Americans produced witch hazel extract by boiling the stems of the shrub and producing a [[decoction]], which was used to treat swellings, [[inflammation]]s, and tumors.<ref name=Dweck>Anthony C.

The species has become a significant invasive weed in other regions of the world.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:HoneyLocustThorn.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Detail of thorns]]\nHoney locusts, ''Gleditsia triacanthos'', can reach a height of {{convert|20|\u2013|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with fast growth, and are relatively short-lived; their life spans are typically about 120 years, though some live up to 150 years. They are prone to losing large branches in windstorms. The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[pinnate]]ly [[compound leaf|compound]] on older trees but [[bipinnate]]ly compound on vigorous young trees. The leaflets are {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2.5|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} (smaller on bipinnate leaves) and bright green. They turn yellow in the fall ([[autumn]]). Honey locusts leaf out relatively late in spring, but generally slightly earlier than the [[black locust]] (''[[Robinia pseudoacacia]]''). The strongly scented cream-colored [[flower]]s appear in late spring, in clusters emerging from the base of the [[leaf axil]]s.\n\nThe [[fruit]] of the honey locust is a flat [[legume]] (pod) that matures in early autumn. The pods are generally between {{convert|15|\u2013|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}. The pulp on the insides of the [[legume|pods]] is edible, unlike the [[black locust]], which is toxic. The seeds are dispersed by grazing [[herbivore]]s such as [[cattle]] and [[horse]]s, which eat the pod pulp and excrete the seeds in droppings; the animal's digestive system assists in breaking down the hard seed coat, making germination easier. In addition, the seeds are released in the host's manure, providing fertilizer for them. Honey locust seed pods ripen in late spring and germinate rapidly when temperatures are warm enough.\n\nHoney locusts commonly have [[spine (botany)|thorns]] {{convert|3|\u2013|10|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long growing out of the branches, some reaching lengths over {{convert|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}; these may be single, or branched into several points, and commonly form dense clusters. The thorns are fairly soft and green when young, harden and turn red as they age, then fade to ash grey and turn brittle when mature. These thorns are thought to have evolved to protect the trees from browsing [[Pleistocene megafauna]] which may also have been involved in seed dispersal, but the size and spacing of them is useless in defending against smaller extant herbivores such as deer. Thornless forms (''Gleditsia triacanthos'' var. ''inermis'') are occasionally found growing wild and are available as nursery plants. Hybridization of honey locust with [[Gleditsia aquatica|water locust]] (''G. aquatica'') has been reported.<ref>{{Cite web | author = Sullivan J. | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/gletri/all.html | title = ''Gleditsia triacanthos'' | date = 1994 | accessdate = August 13, 2014 | website = U.S. Forest Service | publisher = U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory}}</ref>\n\n== Cultivation and history ==\nIts [[cultivar]]s are popular [[ornamental plant]]s, especially in the northern plains of North America where few other trees can survive and prosper. It tolerates urban conditions, compacted soil, road salt, alkaline soil, heat, and drought. The popularity is in part due to the fact that it transplants so easily. The fast growth rate and tolerance of poor site conditions make it valued in areas where shade is wanted quickly, such as new parks or housing developments, and in disturbed and reclaimed environments, such as mine tailings. It is resistant to [[gypsy moth]]s but is defoliated by another pest, the [[mimosa webworm]]. [[Spider mite]]s, [[canker]]s, and [[gall]]s are a problem with some trees. Many cultivated varieties do not have thorns.\n\n== Food ==\n[[File:Unripe honey locust pods.jpg|thumb|right|Unripe honey locust pods]]\nDespite its name, the honey locust is not a significant [[honey]] plant.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} The name derives from the sweet taste of the legume pulp, which was used for food by Native American people, and can also be fermented to make [[beer]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} The long pods, which eventually dry and ripen to brown or maroon, are surrounded in a tough, leathery skin that adheres very strongly to the pulp within. The pulp\u2014bright green in unripe pods\u2014is strongly sweet, crisp and succulent in ripe pods. Dark brown tannin-rich beans are found in slots within the pulp.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n== Timber ==\nHoney locusts produce a high quality, durable wood that polishes well, but the tree does not grow in sufficient numbers to support a bulk industry; however, a niche market exists for honey locust furniture. It is also used for posts and rails since it takes a long time to rot. In the past, the hard thorns of the younger trees were used as [[nail (engineering)|nails]] while the wood itself was used to fashion [[treenail]]s for shipbuilding.\n\n== Agriculture ==\n[[File:Gleditsia triacanthos MHNT.BOT.2006.0.1274.JPG|thumb|''Gleditsia triacanthos'' \u2013 [[MHNT]]]]\nThe species is a major invasive environmental and economic weed in agricultural regions of Australia. The plant forms thickets and destroys the pasture required for livestock to survive. The thickets choke waterways and prevent both domestic and native animals from drinking and also harbour [[vermin]]. The spines cause damage to both people and domestic and native wildlife and puncture vehicle tires.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/biodiversity/invasive/weeds/weeddetails.pl?taxon_id=21077 | title = ''Gleditsia triacanthos'' | author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | website = Weeds in Australia | publisher = Australian Government | access-date = January 23, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.weeds.org.au/cgi-bin/weedident.cgi?tpl=plant.tpl&card=T13 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113055/http://www.weeds.org.au/cgi-bin/weedident.cgi?tpl=plant.tpl&card=T13 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2016-03-04 | title = ''Gleditsia triacanthos'' | author = <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | date = | website = weeds.org | publisher = | access-date = }}</ref> In much of the Midwest of the United States the honey locust is also considered a weed tree and a pest that establishes itself in farm fields.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Barlow C. | year = 2001 | title = Anachronistic fruits and the ghosts who haunt them | journal = Arnoldia | volume = 61 | issue = 2 | pages = 14\u201321 | url = http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/2001-61-2-anachronistic-fruits-and-the-ghosts-who-haunt-them.pdf}}</ref> In other regions of the world, ranchers and farmers who employ [[monocropping]] deem honey locust as a nuisance weed; its fast growth allows it to out-compete grasses and other crops.\n\n[[File:2014-10-11 12 49 16 Honey Locust foliage during autumn in Elko, Nevada.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Autumn leaf color]]\n\n== Nitrogen Fixation ==\nThe ability of ''Gleditsia'' to [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] is disputed.

Trees with {{convert|7|ft|m|disp=or|abbr=on}} (over mature) class range diameter at breast height were noted in the Imnaha River drainage as late as January 26, 2015.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n== Description ==\n''J. cinerea'' is a [[deciduous]] [[tree]] growing to {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, rarely {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Butternut is a slow-growing species, and rarely lives longer than 75 years.  It has a {{convert|40|\u2013|80|cm|in|abbr=on}} stem diameter, with light gray [[bark]].\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are [[pinnate]], {{convert|40|\u2013|70|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long, with 11\u201317 leaflets, each leaflet {{convert|5|\u2013|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|\u2013|5|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad. The whole leaf is downy-pubescent, and a somewhat brighter, yellower green than many other tree leaves.\n\n=== Flowering and fruiting ===\n[[File:Butternut nut.jpg|left|thumb|A butternut]]\nButternut flowers from April to June, depending upon location, about the same time as the new leaves appear. The species is [[monoecious]]. Male ([[staminate]]) flowers are inconspicuous, yellow-green slender [[catkin]]s that develop from auxiliary buds and female ([[pistillate]]) flowers are short terminal spikes on current year's shoots. Each female flower has a light pink [[stigma (botany)|stigma]]. Flowers of both sexes do not usually mature simultaneously on any individual tree.\n\nThe [[fruit]] is a lemon-shaped [[nut (fruit)|nut]], produced in bunches of two to six together; the nut is oblong-ovoid, {{convert|3|\u2013|6|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|\u2013|4|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad, surrounded by a green husk before maturity in midautumn.\n\nKey characteristics:\n* [[Alternate (botany)|Alternate]], [[compound leaves]]\n* Odd number of [[leaflet (botany)|leaflets]] \u2013 has a terminal leaflet\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n=== Soil and topography ===\nButternut grows best on stream banks and on well-drained soils. It is seldom found on dry, compact, or infertile soils. It grows better than [[black walnut]], however, on dry, rocky soils, especially those of limestone origin.\n\nButternut is found most frequently in coves, on stream benches and terraces, on slopes, in the talus of rock ledges, and on other sites with good drainage. It is found up to an elevation of {{convert|1500|m|ft}} in the Virginias \u2013 much higher altitudes than black walnut.\n\n=== Associated forest cover ===\nButternut is found with many other tree species in several hardwood types in the mixed mesophytic forest. It is an associated species in the following four northern and central forest cover types: sugar maple\u2013basswood, yellow poplar\u2013white oak\u2013northern red oak, beech\u2013sugar maple, and river birch\u2013sycamore. Commonly associated trees include [[basswood]] (''Tilia'' spp.), [[black cherry]] (''Prunus serotina''), [[beech]] (''Fagus grandifolia''), [[black walnut]] (''Juglans nigra''), [[elm]] (''Ulmus'' spp.), [[Tsuga|hemlock]] (''Tsuga canadensis''), [[hickory]] (''Carya'' spp.), [[oak]] (''Quercus'' spp.), [[red maple]] (''Acer rubrum''), [[sugar maple]] (''Acer saccharum''), [[yellow poplar]] (''Liriodendron tulipifera''), [[white ash]] (''Fraxinus americana''), and [[yellow birch]] (''Betula alleghaniensis''). In the northeast part of its range, it is often found with [[sweet birch]] (''Betula lenta'') and in the northern part of its range it is occasionally found with [[white pine]] (''Pinus strobus''). Forest stands seldom contain more than an occasional butternut tree, although in local areas, it may be abundant. In the past, [[West Virginia]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Indiana]], and [[Tennessee]] have been the leading producers of butternut timber.\n\n==== Canopy competition ====\nAlthough young trees may withstand competition from the side, butternut does not survive under shade from above. It must be in the overstory to thrive. Therefore, it is classed as intolerant of shade and competition.\n\n=== Diseases ===\n[[File:Dead Butternuts.jpg|left|thumb|Butternuts killed by [[butternut canker]]]]\n\n==== Butternut canker ====\nThe most serious disease of ''J. cinerea'' is butternut decline or butternut [[canker]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Butternut Canker|url=http://dontmovefirewood.org/gallery-of-pests/butternut-canker.html|work=Gallery of Pests|publisher=Don't Move Firewood|accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref>  In the past, the causal organism of this disease was thought to be a fungus, ''Melanconis juglandis''. Now this fungus has been associated with secondary infections and the primary causal organism of the disease has been identified as another species of fungus, ''[[Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum]]''. The fungus is spread by wide-ranging [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]],{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} so isolation of a tree offers no protection.\n\nSymptoms of the disease include dying branches and stems. Initially, cankers develop on branches in the lower crown. Spores developing on these dying branches are spread by rainwater to tree stems. Stem cankers develop 1 to 3 years after branches die. Tree tops killed by stem-girdling cankers do not resprout. Diseased trees usually die within several years. Completely free-standing trees seem better able to withstand the fungus than those growing in dense stands or forest. In some areas, 90% of the butternut trees have been killed. The disease is reported to have eliminated butternut from North and South Carolina.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The disease is also reported to be spreading rapidly in Wisconsin. By contrast, black walnut seems to be resistant to the disease.\n\n==== Hybrid resistance ====\nThe hybrid between butternut and the [[Juglans ailantifolia|Japanese walnut]] is commonly known as the 'buartnut' and shows resistance to the butternut canker.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Researchers are back-crossing butternut to buartnut, creating 'butter-buarts\" which should have more butternut traits than buartnuts. They are selecting for resistance to the butternut canker.\n\n==== Other pests ====\n[[Bunch disease]] also attacks butternut. Currently, the causal agent is thought to be a [[mycoplasma]]-like organism. Symptoms include a yellow [[witches' broom]] resulting from sprouting and growth of auxiliary buds that would normally remain dormant. Infected branches fail to become dormant in the fall and are killed by frost; highly susceptible trees may eventually be killed. Butternut seems to be more susceptible to this disease than black walnut.\n\nThe common [[grackle]] has been reported to destroy immature fruit and may be considered a butternut pest when populations are high.\n\nButternut is very susceptible to fire damage, and although the species is generally wind firm, it is subject to frequent storm damage.\n\n=== Conservation ===\nThe species is not listed as threatened federally in the US, but is listed as \"Special Concern\" in [[Kentucky]], \"Exploitably Vulnerable\" in [[New York State]], and \"Threatened\" in [[Tennessee]].<ref>[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=JUCI PLANTS Profile for Juglans cinerea (butternut) | USDA PLANTS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe [[Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada]] placed the butternut on the endangered species list in Canada in 2005.<ref name=\"SAR Registry\" />\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Butternut_sections.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Cross-sections from ''[[The American Woods]]'']]\n=== Lumber ===\nButternut wood is light in weight and takes polish well, and is highly rot resistant, but is much softer than [[black walnut]] wood. Oiled, the grain of the wood usually shows much light.  It is often used to make [[furniture]], and is a favorite of woodcarvers.\n\n=== Fabric dye ===\nButternut bark and nut rinds were once often used to dye cloth to colors between light yellow<ref>Snow, Charles Henry. ''The Principal Species of Wood: Their Characteristic Properties''.  2nd ed.  New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1908. Page 56.</ref> and dark brown.<ref>Saunders, Charles Francis.

Page 227.</ref>  To produce the darker colors, the bark is boiled to concentrate the color. This appears to never have been used as a commercial dye, but rather was used to color homespun cloth.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, inhabitants of areas such as [[southern Illinois]] and southern Indiana&nbsp;\u2013 many of whom had moved there from the Southern United States&nbsp;\u2013 were known as \"butternuts\" from the butternut-dyed homespun cloth that some of them wore.  Later, during the [[American Civil War]], the term \"butternut\" was sometimes applied to [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers. Some Confederate uniforms apparently faded from gray to a tan or light brown.  It is also possible that butternut was used to color the cloth worn by a small number of Confederate soldiers.<ref>Saunders, Charles Francis. ''Useful Wild Plants of the United States and Canada''. New York: [[Robert M. McBride]] & Co., 1920. Page 227.</ref>  The resemblance of these uniforms to butternut-dyed clothing, and the association of butternut dye with home-made clothing, resulted in this derisive nickname.\n\n=== Medicinal ===\nButternut bark has mild [[cathartic]] properties {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} and was once used medicinally in place of [[jalap]], a more expensive cathartic which was imported from Mexico.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, a butternut extract made from the inner bark of the tree was used in an attempt to prevent [[smallpox]], and to treat [[dysentery]] and other stomach and intestinal discomfort.<ref>Thatcher, James, M.D. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fHG1rHriGM0C&pg=PA251 ''A Military Journal During the American Revolutionary War''.] Boston: Cottons & Barnard, 1827.

It grows mostly in [[riparian zone]]s, from southern [[Ontario]], west to southeast [[South Dakota]], south to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], northern [[Florida]] and southwest to central [[Texas]]. Wild trees in the upper [[Ottawa Valley]] may be an isolated native population or may have derived from planted trees.\n\nBlack walnut is an important tree commercially, as the wood is a deep brown color and easily worked.  The fruits, walnuts, are cultivated for their distinctive and desirable taste. Often, trees are grown for both lumber and walnuts simultaneously and many cultivars have been developed for improved quality nuts or wood. Black walnut is currently under pressure from the [[thousand cankers disease]] which is causing decline of walnuts in some areas. Black walnut is also [[Allelopathy|allelopathic]] which means that it releases chemicals from roots and other tissues which harm other organisms and give the tree a competitive advantage; this is often undesirable as it can harm garden plants and grasses.\n\n== Description ==\n*'''Odor''' Most parts of the tree including leaves, stems, and fruit [[husk]]s have a very characteristic pungent or spicy odor. This odor is lacking in the nut itself.<ref name=\"peters\" /><ref name=\"dirr\" />\n*'''Trunk''' Height {{convert|30|-|40|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}. Under forest competition, it develops a tall and straight [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]].

The '''male''' ([[staminate]]) flowers are in drooping [[catkins]] {{convert|8|\u2013|10|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long. These are borne from axilary buds on the previous year's growth. The '''female''' ([[pistillate]]) flowers are terminal, in clusters of two to five on the current year's growth.<ref name=\":1\" />\n*'''Fruit''' Ripens during the autumn into a fruit (nut) with a brownish-green, semifleshy husk and a brown, corrugated nut. The whole fruit, including the husk falls in October or November; the seed is relatively small and very hard.\n\nThe fruit production tends to occur irregularly with some years producing larger crops than others (see [[mast year]]). Fruiting may begin when the tree is 4\u20136 years old, however large crops take 20 years. Total lifespan of ''J. nigra'' is about 130 years. Black walnut does not leaf out until late spring when the soil has warmed and all frost danger is past. Like other trees of the order [[Fagales]], such as oaks, hickories, chestnuts, and birches, it is monoecious, with wind-pollinated catkins. Male and female flowers are in separate [[spike (botany)|spikes]], and the female flowers typically appear before the male on a single tree ([[dichogamy]]). As a consequence, [[self-pollination]] is unlikely. However, individual trees usually are not self-sterile; if they are not pollinated by neighboring trees, they may set self-fertilized seeds.<ref name=\":1\" /> For maximum seed germination, the seeds should be [[cold-moist stratified]] for 3\u20134 months, although the exact time depends on the seed source.<ref name=\":1\" /> The seedlings emerge in April or May and typically grow {{convert|90|cm|in|round=5|abbr=on}} their first year and even more in the 2nd year.<ref name=\":1\" /> Black walnut often loses its leaves earlier than other deciduous trees growing in the same area after having a growing period of 115\u2013135 days.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBlack walnut has a strong [[taproot]] which makes the seedlings resilient, but difficult to transplant.\n\nBlack walnut is more resistant to frost than the [[English walnut|English]] or [[Persian walnut]], but thrives best in the warmer regions of fertile, lowland soils with high water tables, although it will also grow in drier soils, but much more slowly.<ref name=\"dirr\" /> Some soils preferred by black walnut include A[[Alfisol|lfisol]] and [[Entisol]] soil types.<ref name=\":1\">{{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Juglans |species=nigra |first=Robert D. |last=Williams |access-date=2016-06-29}}</ref> Walnut grows best on sandy loam, loam, or silt loam type soils but will also grow well on silty clay loam soils. It prefers these soils due to the fact that these soils hold large quantities of water which the tree draws from during dry periods.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nVisually, black walnut is similar to the [[butternut tree|butternut]] (''Juglans cinerea'') in leaf shape, and the range also overlaps significantly. The fruits are quite different, and their presence makes an identification easy, as black walnut fruits are round and butternuts are more oval-oblong shaped. When a fruit is not available, two species can be differentiated based on the [[leaf scar]]s, or the place where the leaf meets the stem: butternut has a leaf scar with a flat upper edge and with a velvety ridge above that flat part, but black walnut has an indented leaf scar with no hairy ridge.<ref>{{eFloras|1|116860|Juglans nigra}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nBlack walnut is primarily a [[pioneer species]] similar to [[red maple|red]] and [[silver maple]] and [[black cherry]]. Because of this, black walnut is a common weed tree found along roadsides, fields, and forest edges in the eastern US. It will grow in closed forests, but is classified as shade intolerant, this means it requires full sun for optimal growth and nut production .\n\nThe nuts are food for many rodents and make up to 10% of the diet of [[eastern fox squirrel]]s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/jugnig/all.html|title=Juglans nigra|website=www.fs.fed.us|access-date=2016-06-29}}</ref> The nuts are also eaten by species of birds. The leaves are browsed by [[white tailed deer]],<ref name=\":0\" /> although they are not a preferred food. Squirrels benefit this species by distributing and burying the seeds; if the seeds are not reclaimed by the squirrel, they will germinate and help disperse the species.\n\nWhere the range of the eastern black walnut overlaps that of the Texas black walnut (''[[Juglans microcarpa|J.&nbsp;microcarpa]]''), the two species sometimes interbreed, producing populations with characteristics intermediate between the two species.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/jugmic/all.html|title=Juglans microcarpa|website=www.fs.fed.us|access-date=2016-06-29}}</ref> ''J.nigra'' and ''J. cinerea'' often grow in the same range as well but they do not hybridize naturally.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe tree's roots often form [[endomycorrhiza]]l relationships with fungi in the genus [[Glomus (fungus)|''Glomus'']]. Some endomycorrhizal relations improve the plant's growth.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSpecies often associated with ''J. nigra'' include [[yellow-poplar]] (''Liriodendron tulipifera''), [[white ash]] (''Fraxinus americana''), [[black cherry]] (''Prunus serotina''), [[basswood]] (''Tilia americana''), [[American beech]] (''Fagus grandifolia''), [[sugar maple]] (''Acer saccharum''), [[oak]]s (''Quercus'' spp.), and [[hickory|hickories]] (''Carya'' spp.). Near the western edge of its range, black walnut may be confined to floodplains, where it grows either with [[American elm]] (''Ulmus americana''), [[common hackberry]] (''Celtis occidentalis''), [[green ash]] (''Fraxinus pennsylvanica''), and [[boxelder]] (''Acer negundo''), or with basswood and [[red oak]] (''Quercus rubra'') on lower slopes and other favorable sites.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Uses ==\n{{Nutritional value\n| name            = Walnut, black (''J.&nbsp;nigra'')\n| image           = Black Walnut Juglans nigra Nut 2400px.jpg\n| caption         = Black walnut\n| serving_size    = 100 grams\n| kJ              = 2586\n| carbs           = 9.91&nbsp;g\n| fat             = 59.00&nbsp;g\n| protein         = 24.06&nbsp;g\n| sugars          = 1.10&nbsp;g\n| sucrose         = 1.00&nbsp;g\n| glucose         = 0.05&nbsp;g\n| fructose        = 0.05&nbsp;g\n| satfat          = 3.368&nbsp;g\n| monofat         = 15.004&nbsp;g\n| polyfat         = 35.077&nbsp;g\n| omega3fat       = 2.006&nbsp;g\n| omega6fat       = 33.072&nbsp;g\n| fiber           = 6.8&nbsp;g\n| starch          = 0.24&nbsp;g\n| water           = 4.56&nbsp;g\n| calcium_mg      = 61\n| iron_mg         = 3.12\n| phosphorus_mg   = 513\n| magnesium_mg    = 201\n| manganese_mg    = 3.896\n| sodium_mg       = 2\n| potassium_mg    = 523\n| zinc_mg         = 3.37\n| vitA_ug         = 2\n| vitA_iu         = 40\n| thiamin_mg      = 0.057\n| riboflavin_mg   = 0.130\n| niacin_mg       = 0.470\n| pantothenic_mg  = 1.660\n| vitB6_mg        = 0.583\n| folate_ug       = 31\n| vitB12_ug       = 0\n| vitC_mg         = 1.7\n| vitD_ug         = 0\n| vitD_iu         = 0\n| vitE_mg         = 1.80\n| vitK_ug         = 2.7\n| source          = \n| source_usda     = 1\n}}\n\n=== Planting ===\nWhile its primary native region is the Midwest and east-central United States, the black walnut was introduced into Europe in 1629 and is also cultivated in Hawaii.<ref name=\":0\" /> It is cultivated there and in North America as a forest tree for its high-quality wood. Black walnut plantings can be made to produce timber, nuts, or both timber and nuts.  Patented timber-type trees were selected and released from [[Purdue University]] in the early 1990s.  These trees have been sporadically available from [[Plant nursery|nurseries]]. Varieties include Purdue #1, which can be used for both timber and nut production, though nut quality is poor compared to varieties selected specifically as nut producers.\n\n[[File:2014-10-30 10 16 45 Black Walnut foliage during autumn along Fireside Avenue in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|thumb|left|Autumn foliage]]\n[[Grafting|Grafted]], nut-producing trees are available from several nurseries operating in the U.S.  Selections worth considering include Thomas, Neel #1, Thomas Myers, Pounds #2, Stoker, Surprise, Emma K, Sparrow, S127, and McGinnis.  Several older varieties, such as Kwik Krop, are still in cultivation; while they make decent nuts, they would not be recommended for commercial planting.  A variety index and characteristics guide is available from [http://extension.missouri.edu/p/XM1001 Missouri Extension].\n\nPollination requirements should be considered when planting black walnuts.  As is typical of many species in Juglandaceae, ''Juglans nigra'' trees tend to be [[Sequential hermaphroditism|dichogamous]], i.e.. produce [[pollen]] first and then [[Gynoecium#Pistil|pistillate flowers]] or else produce pistillate flowers and then pollen. An early pollen-producer should be grouped with other varieties that produce pistillate flowers so all varieties benefit from overlap.  Cranz, Thomas, and Neel #1 make a good pollination trio.  A similar group for more northern climates would be Sparrow, S127, and Mintle.\n\nSometimes black walnut is planted as part of reclaiming mines.<ref name=\":0\" /> When growing young trees weed control is critical for healthy establishment of the trees, without weed control the young trees are harmed significantly in their growth rate.\n\n''J. nigra'' is also grown as a specimen ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, growing to {{convert|30|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall by {{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} broad.<ref name=RHSAZ>{{cite book|title=RHS A-Z encyclopedia of garden plants|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1-4053-3296-4|pages=1136}}</ref> It has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref>{{cite web|title=''Juglans nigra''|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=6235|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society|accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Food ===\nBlack walnut nuts are shelled commercially in the United States. About 65% of the annual wild harvest comes from the U.S. state of [[Missouri]], and the largest processing plant is operated by Hammons Products in [[Stockton, Missouri]]. The nutmeats provide a robust, distinctive, natural flavor and crunch as a food ingredient.  Popular uses include ice cream, bakery goods and confections.  Consumers include black walnuts in traditional treats, such as [[cake]]s, [[cookie]]s, [[fudge]], and [[pie]]s, during the fall holiday season.  The nuts' nutritional profile leads to uses in other foods, such as [[salad]]s, [[fish]], [[pork]], [[chicken]], vegetables and pasta dishes.\n\nNutritionally similar to the milder-tasting English walnut, the black walnut kernel is high in unsaturated fat and protein.  An analysis of nut oil from five named ''J.&nbsp;nigra'' cultivars (Ogden, Sparrow, Baugh, Carter and Thomas) showed the most prevalent fatty acid in ''J.&nbsp;nigra'' oil is [[linoleic acid]] (27.80\u201333.34&nbsp;g/100g dry kernel), followed (in the same units) by [[oleic acid]] (14.52\u201324.40), [[linolenic acid]] (1.61\u20133.23), [[palmitic acid]] (1.61\u20132.15), and [[stearic acid]] (1.07\u20131.69).<ref>Senter, S.

The juvenile leaves are found on young plants up to 3 years old, and as scattered shoots on adult trees, usually in shade. The [[conifer cone|seed cones]] are {{convert|3|-|7|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} long, [[Berry (botany)|berry]]-like, dark purple-blue with a white wax cover giving an overall sky-blue color (though the wax often rubs off); they contain one to three (rarely up to four) [[seed]]s, and are mature in 6\u20138 months from pollination.

''virginiana'' is called eastern juniper / redcedar. It is found in eastern North America, from [[Maine]], west to southern [[Ontario]] and [[South Dakota]], south to northernmost [[Florida]] and southwest into the post oak savannah of east-central [[Texas]]. Cones are larger, {{convert|4|\u2013|7|mm|frac=16|abbr=on}}; scale leaves are acute at apex and bark is red-brown.\n*''Juniperus virginiana'' var. ''silicicola'' (Small) E.Murray (syn. ''Sabina silicicola'' Small, ''Juniperus silicicola'' (Small) L.H.Bailey) is known as southern or sand juniper / redcedar. Habitat is along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from the extreme Southeastern corner of [[Virginia]],<ref>http://www.dof.virginia.gov/infopubs/_outside-pubs/USDA-FS-SRS-155_outpub.pdf</ref> south to central [[Florida]] and west to southeast [[Texas]]. Cones are smaller, {{convert|3|\u2013|4|mm|frac=16|abbr=on}}; scale leaves are blunt at apex and the bark is orange-brown. It is treated by some authors at the lower rank of variety, while others treat it as a distinct species.\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Juniperus virginiana near Oxford, Ohio.jpg|left|thumb|Characteristic shape in old field succession]]\nEastern juniper is a [[pioneer species]], which means that it is one of the first trees to repopulate cleared, eroded, or otherwise damaged land.  It is unusually long lived among pioneer species, with the potential to live over 900 years. It is commonly found in [[prairie]]s or oak barrens, old pastures, or [[limestone]] hills, often along highways and near recent construction sites.<ref name=farjon /><ref name=gd /><ref name=\"NW-Barlow\" /> It is an alternate host for [[Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae|cedar\u2013apple rust]], an economically significant [[fungal disease]] of apples, and some management strategies recommend the removal of ''J. virginiana'' near apple orchards<ref name=wvu>[[West Virginia University]]: [http://www.caf.wvu.edu/kearneysville/disease_descriptions/omcar.html Cedar-Apple Rust, ''Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae'']</ref>\n\nIn many areas it is considered an [[invasive species]], even if native. It is [[fire-intolerant]], and was previously controlled by periodic [[wildfire]]s. Low branches near the ground burn and provide a ladder that allows fire to engulf the whole tree. Grasses recover quickly from low severity fires that are characteristic of prairies that kept the trees at bay. With the urbanization of prairies, the fires have been stopped with roads, plowed fields, and other fire breaks, allowing ''J. virginiana'' and other trees to invade.<ref>[http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/marktwain/projects/forest_plan/86_plan/Appendix_E.pdf Forest Plan]</ref> Trees are destructive to grasslands if left unchecked, and are actively being eliminated by cutting and [[prescribed burning]].<ref>Noble Foundation: [http://www.noble.org/Press_Release/Ag/EasternRedCedar/ArbuckleRestoration.html News Release]</ref> The trees also burn very readily, and dense populations were blamed for the rapid spread of wildfires in drought stricken [[Oklahoma]] and [[Texas]] in 2005 and 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0601/01/bn.02.html|title=Wildfires Rip Through Oklahoma|agency=[[CNN]]|date=January 1, 2006|accessdate=April 11, 2007}}</ref>\n\nEastern juniper benefits from increased [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] levels, unlike the grasses with which it competes.  Many grasses are [[C4 carbon fixation|C4 plants]] that concentrate CO<sub>2</sub> levels in their bundle sheaths to increase the efficiency of [[RuBisCO]], the enzyme responsible for [[photosynthesis]], while junipers are [[C3 carbon fixation|C3 plants]] that rely on (and may benefit from) the natural CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of the environment, although they are less efficient at fixing CO<sub>2</sub> in general.<ref>McKinley, Duncan C., and John M. Blair. \"Woody Plant Encroachment by ''Juniperus virginiana'' in a Mesic Native Grassland Promotes Rapid Carbon and Nitrogen Accrual.\" Ecosystems 11.3 (Apr. 2008): 454-468.</ref>\n\nDamage done by ''J. virginiana'' includes outcompeting forage species in pastureland. The low branches and wide base occupy a significant portion of land area.  The thick foliage blocks out most light, so few plants can live under the canopy. The needles that fall raise the [[Soil pH|pH of the soil]], making it [[alkali]]ne, which holds nutrients such as phosphorus, making it harder for plants to absorb them.  ''Juniperus virginiana'' has been shown to remove [[nitrogen]] from the soil after invading prairies.<ref>Norris, Mark D., John M. Blair, and Loretta C. Johnson. \"Altered Ecosystem Nitrogen Dynamics as a Consequence of Land Cover Change in Tallgrass Prairie.\" American Midland Naturalist 158.2 (Oct. 2007): 432-445.</ref> It has also been found to reduce carbon stores in the soil.  This reduction in soil nutrients also reduces the amount and diversity of microbial activity in the soil.<ref>McKinley, Duncan C., and John M.

It takes about 12 minutes for their seeds to pass through the birds' guts, and seeds that have been consumed by this bird have levels of germination roughly three times higher than those of seeds the birds did not eat.

They thrive under adverse conditions \u2013 both drought tolerant and cold tolerant, they grow well in rocky, sandy, and clay substrates. Competition between trees is minimal, so they can be planted in tightly spaced rows, and the trees still grow to full height, creating a solid windbreak in a short time.<ref>[http://hort.ufl.edu/trees/JUNVIRA.pdf USDA Fact Sheet]</ref>\n\nA number of [[cultivar]]s have been selected for garden planting, including 'Canaertii' (narrow conical; female) 'Corcorcor' (with a dense, erect crown; female), 'Goldspire' (narrow conical with yellow foliage), and 'Kobold' (dwarf). Some cultivars previously listed under this species, notably 'Skyrocket', are actually cultivars of ''J. scopulorum''.<ref>Welch, H., & Haddow, G. (1993). ''The World Checklist of Conifers''. Landsman's.

People allergic to one are usually allergic to both. ''J. virginiana'' sheds pollen as early as late winter and through early spring. Consequently, what begins as an allergy to Ashe juniper in the winter may extend into spring, since the pollination of the eastern juniper follows that of the Ashe juniper.\n\nContact with the leaves or wood can produce a mild skin rash in some individuals.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Cedar wood]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikispecies}}\n* [http://www.pollenlibrary.com/index.php?view=species.php&state=&county=&genus=Juniperus&common=Eastern%20Red-Cedar&species=Juniperus%20virginiana PollenLibrary.com \u2013 Red Cedar distribution map and allergen information]\n* [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_1/juniperus/virginiana.htm USDA Forest Service: Silvics of Trees of North America: ''Juniperus virginiana'']<!--\nRef: {{Silvics |volume=1 |genus=Juniperus |species=virginiana |first=Edwin R. |last=Lawson }} -->\n\n*[http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/juniperus-virginiana-eastern-redcedar-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map of ''Juniperus virginiana'']\n{{Commons category|position=left}}\n\n\n{{Cupressaceae}}\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Juniperus|virginiana]]\n[[Category:Dioecious plants]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Plains-Midwest (United States)]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Plants used in bonsai]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

Sweet gum is one of the main valuable forest trees in the southeastern [[United States]], and is a popular ornamental tree in [[temperate zone|temperate climates]]. It is recognizable by the combination of its five-pointed star-shaped leaves and its hard, spiked fruits.

Its [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''styraciflua'' is an old generic name meaning \"flowing with storax\" (a plant resin).<ref name=Grimm /> The name \"[[storax balsam|storax]]\" has long been confusingly applied to the aromatic gum or resin of this species, that of ''[[Liquidambar orientalis|L.&nbsp;orientalis]]'' of [[Turkey]], and to the resin better known as [[benzoin resin|benzoin]] from various tropical trees in the genus ''[[Styrax]]''.\n\nThe sweetgum has a [[Nahuatl]] name, ''Ocotzocuahuitl'', which translates to ''tree that gives pine resin'' from ''ocotl'' (pine), ''tzotl'' (resin), ''cuahuitl'' (tree), which refers to the use of the tree's resin.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7qgPCEiI4WMC&pg|title=Florida Ethnobotany|last=Austin|first=Daniel F.|date=2004-11-29|publisher=CRC Press|year=2004|isbn=9780203491881|location=|pages=407|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe common name \"sweet gum\" refers to the species' \"sweetish gum\",<ref name=Werthner>{{cite book|last=Werthner|first=William B.|title=Some American Trees:  An intimate study of native Ohio trees|year=1935|publisher=The Macmillan Company|location=New York|pages=xviii + 398 pp.}}</ref> contrasting with the [[Nyssa sylvatica|black gum ''(Nyssa sylvatica)'']], only distantly related, with which the sweet gum overlaps broadly in range.  The species is also known as the \"red gum\", for its reddish bark.<ref name=Werthner />\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest known published record of ''Liquidambar styraciflua'' is in a work by [[Spain|Spanish]] [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de Toledo|Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez]] published posthumously in 1651, in which he describes the species as a large tree producing a fragrant gum resembling liquid amber, whence the genus name ''Liquidambar.'' In Ray's ''Historia Plantarum'' (1686) it is called ''Styrax liquida''. However, the first mention of any use of the amber is described by Juan de Grijalva, the nephew of the Govorner of Cuba, in the year 1517.\nJuan de Grijalva tells of gift exchanges with the Mayas \"who presented them with, among other things, hollow reeds of about a span long filled with dried herbs and sweet-smelling liquid amber which, when lighted in the way shown by the natives, diffused an agreeable odour.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Corti|first1=Count|title=A History of Smoking|date=1931|publisher=George G.

The species also occurs in [[Mexico]] from southern [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]] south to [[Chiapas]], as well as in [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]] and also in southern [[Brazil]]. In Mexico and [[Central America]], it is a characteristic plant of [[cloud forests]], growing at middle elevations in various mountainous areas where the climate is humid and more temperate.<ref name=Grimm />\n\nThe US government distribution maps for this species are incorrect concerning the southern limit of distribution in Florida.

Limber and Cash reported that leaf spots produced by this pathogen on several different genera of forest trees were 2\u20135&nbsp;mm diameter with regular margins. During the summer of 1994 in the Nacogdoches County area of Texas, a prominent leaf spot on Sweet Gum was widespread. Infected leaves had numerous necrotic lesions, each surrounded by a reddish halo. The lesions tended to merge resulting in large areas of dead tissue. Infection and fungal development of ''D.&nbsp;dryina'' were investigated on leaves of sweet gum using a combination of microscopic techniques. ''D.&nbsp;dryina'' infection on Sweet Gum has been associated with the disease red leaf spot. Results of this investigation indicate that ''D.&nbsp;dryina'' can penetrate leaf tissue directly, thus having the ability to initiate infection on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. In other regions of the U.S., Sweet Gum populations may not be as susceptible to local populations of this fungus. Environmental stress factors may also be involved, as reports have indicated that herbicide application and [[chlorosis]] caused by iron deficiency may increase susceptibility of ''[[Dicarpella dryina]]''. [[Tannin]]s (a type of biomolecule found in trees to protect it from fire, insects, and bacteria) have been reported to occur in healthy tissue of a variety of plants including sweet gum. They may prevent pathogen invasion by inhibiting fungal enzyme activity. Although cells of healthy sweet gum tissue appear rich in tannins, these materials apparently were not effective in preventing fungal colonization by ''D.&nbsp;dryina''.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Josephine|author2=Shane Clark |title=Infection and Fungal Development of ''Dicarpella dryina'' on Sweet Gum (''Liquidambar styraciflua'')|journal=Mycologia|date=July\u2013August 1996|volume=88|series=Search Wise|issue=4|pages=613\u2013618|<!-- accessdate=17 September 2012 -->|doi=10.2307/3761156}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n* {{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Liquidambar |species=styraciflua }}\n* {{eFloras|1|220007687|Liquidambar styraciflua}}\n{{1728}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|Liquidambar styraciflua}}{{wikispecies}}\n* {{PLANTS |symbol=LIQUI |name=Liquidambar styraciflua}}\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/liquidambar-styraciflua-sweetgum-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map for ''Liquidambar styraciflua'']\n* [http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Liquidambar+styraciflua University of Michigan - Dearborn: Native American Ethnobotany of  ''Liquidambar styraciflua'']\n* [http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/data/atlas/little/liqustyr.pdf USGS Species Distribution Maps: ''Liquidambar styraciflua''] (pdf file).\n* [http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/list2.htm Bioimages.vanderbilt.edu: ''Liquidambar styraciflua'' images]\n* [http://landscaping.about.com/od/fallfoliagetrees/p/sweetgum_trees.htm Landscaping.about.com: American Sweetgum Trees]\n* {{IUCN2006|assessor=Americas Regional Workshop (Conservation|assessor2=Sustainable Management of Trees, Costa Rica, November 1996)|last-assessor-amp=yes|year=1998|id=33966|title=Liquidambar styraciflua|downloaded=12 May 2006}}\n <!-- Most of Florida, as opposed to the continental trees of \"Trees of Northern Florida\" -->\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Altingiaceae]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Southern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of Belize]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Trees of Honduras]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Trees of Chiapas]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Hidalgo (state)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puebla]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Veracruz]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Least concern plants]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

It is native to eastern North America from [[Southern Ontario|Southern]] [[Ontario]] and [[Illinois]] eastward to [[southeastern Massachusetts]] and [[Rhode Island]], and south to central [[Florida]] and [[Louisiana]]. It can grow to more than {{convert|50|m|-1|ft|abbr=on}} in virgin cove forests of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], often with no limbs until it reaches {{convert|25|\u2013|30|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} in height, making it a very valuable [[timber]] tree. It is fast-growing, without the common problems of weak [[wood]] strength and short lifespan often seen in fast-growing species. April marks the start of the flowering period in the southern USA (except as noted below); trees at the northern limit of cultivation begin to flower in June. The flowers are pale green or yellow (rarely white), with an orange band on the [[tepals]]; they yield large quantities of [[nectar]]. The tulip tree is the [[list of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[Indiana]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Tennessee]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe tulip tree is one of the largest of the native trees of the eastern United States, known to reach the height of {{convert|190|ft|m|-1|abbr=on|order=flip}}, with a trunk {{convert|10|ft|m|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} in diameter; its ordinary height is {{convert|70|to|100|ft|m|-1|abbr=on|order=flip}}. It prefers deep, rich, and rather moist soil; it is common, though not abundant, nor is it solitary. Its roots are fleshy. Growth is fairly rapid, and the typical form of its head is conical.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book\n  | last =Keeler\n  | first =Harriet L.\n  | title =Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them\n  | publisher =Charles Scriber's Sons\n  | year =1900\n  | location =New York\n  | pages =14\u201319 }}</ref>\n\nThe bark is brown, and furrowed. The branchlets are smooth, and lustrous, initially reddish, maturing to dark gray, and finally brown. Aromatic and bitter.\nThe wood is light yellow to brown, and the sapwood creamy white; light, soft, brittle, close, straight-grained. Specific gravity: 0.4230; density: {{convert|26.36|lb/cuft|g/dm3|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n* Winter buds: Dark red, covered with a bloom, obtuse; scales becoming conspicuous stipules for the unfolding leaf, and persistent until the leaf is fully grown. Flower-bud enclosed in a two-valved, caducous bract.\n\nThe alternate leaves are simple, pinnately veined, measuring five to six inches long and wide. They have four lobes, and are heart-shaped or truncate or slightly wedge-shaped at base, entire, and the apex cut across at a shallow angle, making the upper part of the leaf look square; midrib and primary veins prominent. They come out of the bud recurved by the bending down of the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] near the middle bringing the apex of the folded leaf to the base of the bud, light green, when full grown are bright green, smooth and shining above, paler green beneath, with downy veins. In autumn they turn a clear, bright yellow.  [[Petiole (botany)|Petiole]] long, slender, angled.\n\n* Flowers: May. Perfect, solitary, terminal, greenish yellow, borne on stout [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncles]], an inch and a half to two inches long, cup-shaped, erect, conspicuous. The bud is enclosed in a sheath of two triangular bracts which fall as the blossom opens.\n* Calyx: Sepals three, imbricate in bud, reflexed or spreading, somewhat veined, early deciduous.\n* Corolla: Cup-shaped, petals six, two inches long, in two rows, imbricate, hypogynous, greenish yellow, marked toward the base with yellow. Somewhat fleshy in texture.\n* Stamens: Indefinite, imbricate in many ranks on the base of the receptacle; filaments thread-like, short; anthers extrorse, long, two-celled, adnate; cells opening longitudinally.\n* Pistils: Indefinite, imbricate on the long slender receptacle. Ovary one-celled; style acuminate, flattened; stigma short, one-sided, recurved; ovules two.\n* Fruit: Narrow light brown cone, formed from many [[Samara (fruit)|samaras]] which are dispersed by wind, leaving the axis persistent all winter. September, October.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nA description from ''[[Our native trees and how to identify them]]'' by [[Harriet Louise Keeler]]:<ref name=Keeler />\n{{quote|The leaves are of unusual shape and develop in a most peculiar and characteristic manner. The leaf-buds are composed of scales as is usual, and these scales grow with the growing shoot. In this respect the buds do not differ from those of many other trees, but what is peculiar is that each pair of scales develops so as to form an oval envelope which contains the young leaf and protects it against changing temperatures until it is strong enough to sustain them without injury. When it has reached that stage the bracts separate, the tiny leaf comes out carefully folded along the line of the midrib, opens as it matures, and until it becomes full grown the bracts do duty as stipules, becoming an inch or more in length before they fall. The leaf is unique in shape, its apex is cut off at the end in a way peculiarly its own, the petioles are long, angled, and so poised that the leaves flutter independently, and their glossy surfaces so catch and toss the light that the effect of the foliage as a whole is much brighter than it otherwise would be.\nThe flowers are large, brilliant, and on detached trees numerous. Their color is greenish yellow with dashes of red and orange, and their resemblance to a tulip very marked. They do not droop from the spray but sit erect. The fruit is a cone {{convert|2|to|3|in|cm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} long, made of a great number of thin narrow scales attached to a common axis. These scales are each a carpel surrounded by a thin membranous ring. Each cone contains sixty or seventy of these scales, of which only a few are productive.

New York:  McGraw-Hill, 2006. Credo Reference. Web. 26 September 2012.</ref> It is found sparingly in New England, it is abundant on the southern shore of Lake Erie and westward to Illinois. It extends south to north Florida, and is rare west of the Mississippi River, but is found occasionally for ornamentals. Its finest development is in the Southern Appalachian mountains, where trees may exceed {{convert|170|ft|m|-1|abbr=on|order=flip}} in height.\n\n== Ecology ==\n''Liriodendron tulipifera'' is generally considered to be a [[shade tolerance|shade-intolerant]] species that is most commonly associated with the first century of forest [[ecological succession|succession]]. In Appalachian forests, it is a dominant species during the 50\u2013150 years of succession, but is absent or rare in stands of trees 500 years or older. On [[mesic habitat|mesic]], fertile soils, it often forms pure or nearly pure stands. It can and does persist in older forests when there is sufficient disturbance to generate large enough gaps for regeneration.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2261149|title=Disturbance and the Population Dynamics of Liriodendron Tulipifera: Simulations with a Spatial Model of Forest Succession|first=Richard T.|last=Busing|date=1 January 1995|publisher=|journal=Journal of Ecology|volume=83|issue=1|pages=45\u201353|doi=10.2307/2261149}}</ref> Individual trees have been known to live for up to around 500 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~adk/oldlisteast/#spp |title=Eastern OLDLIST: A database of maximum tree ages for Eastern North America |publisher=Ldeo.columbia.edu |date=1972-12-15 |accessdate=2014-04-07}}</ref>\n\nAll young tulip trees and most mature specimens are intolerant of prolonged inundation; however, a [[coastal plain]] [[swamp]] ecotype in the southeastern United States is relatively [[flood]]-tolerant.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2445769|title=The Significance of Allozyme Variation and Introgression in the Liriodendron tulipifera Complex (Magnoliaceae)|first1=Clifford R.|last1=Parks|first2=Jonathan F.|last2=Wendel|first3=Mitchell M.|last3=Sewell|first4=Yin-Long|last4=Qiu|date=1 January 1994|publisher=|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=81|issue=7|pages=878\u2013889|doi=10.2307/2445769}}</ref> This ecotype is recognized by its blunt-lobed leaves, which may have a red tint.\n''Liriodendron tulipifera'' produces a large amount of seed, which is dispersed by wind. The seeds typically travel a distance equal to 4\u20135 times the height of the tree, and remain viable for 4\u20137 years. The seeds are not one of the most important food sources for wildlife, but they are eaten by a number of birds and mammals.<ref name=\"silvics\">{{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Liriodendron |species=tulipifera |first=Donald E. |last=Beck |accessdate=2014-04-07}}</ref>\n\nVines, especially [[Vitis|wild grapevines]], are known to be extremely damaging to young trees of this species. Vines are damaging both due to blocking out solar radiation, and increasing weight on limbs which can lead to bending of the trunk and/or breaking of limbs.<ref name=\"silvics\" />\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\n[[File:Eiteljorg Museum--'Oonseentia by Gerald Clarke--20 May 2012.JPG|thumb|Tulip tree sign at [[Eiteljorg Museum]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], with [[Miami-Illinois language]] name, \"oonseentia\"]]\nOriginally described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], ''Liriodendron tulipifera'' is one of two species (see also ''L.chinense'') in the genus ''[[Liriodendron]]'' in the magnolia family. The name ''Liriodendron'' is Greek for \"lily tree\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nature Ramblings|journal=Science News-Letter|date=12 May 1951|volume=59|issue=19|page=300|doi=10.2307/3928783|jstor=3928783}}</ref> It is also called the tuliptree Magnolia, or sometimes, by the lumber industry, as the tulip poplar or yellow poplar. However, it is not closely related to true [[lilium|lilies]], [[tulips]] or [[populus|poplars]].\n\nThe tulip tree has impressed itself upon popular attention in many ways, and consequently has many common names. The tree's traditional name in the [[Miami-Illinois language]] is \"oonseentia\". Native Americans so habitually made their [[dugout canoe]]s of its trunk that the early settlers west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] called it Canoewood. The color of its wood gives it the name Whitewood. In areas near the [[Mississippi River]] it is called a [[Populus|poplar]] largely because of the fluttering habits of its leaves, in which it resembles trees of that genus. It is sometimes called \"fiddle tree,\" because its peculiar leaves, with their arched bases and in-cut sides, suggest the violin shape.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nature Ramblings|journal=Science News-Letter|date=17 June 1961|volume=79|issue=24|page=384|doi=10.2307/3942819|jstor=3942819}}</ref>  The external resemblance of its flowers to [[tulip]]s named it the Tulip-tree.<ref name=Keeler /> In their internal structure, however, they are quite different. Instead of the triple arrangements of stamens and pistil parts, they have indefinite numbers arranged in spirals.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nature Ramblings|journal=Science News-Letter|date=7 May 1955|volume=67|issue=19|page=302|doi=10.2307/3934969|jstor=3934969}}</ref>\n\n== East Central Florida ecotype ==\nParts of east-central [[Florida]] near [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] have an ecotype with similar-looking leaves to the coastal plain variant of the Carolinas; it flowers much earlier (usually in March, although flowering can begin in late January), with a smaller yellower bloom than other types. This east central Florida ecotype seems to have the best ability to tolerate very wet conditions, where it may grow short pencil-like root structures (pneumatophores) similar to those produced by other swamp trees in warm climates. Superior resistance to drought, pests and wind is also noted. Some individuals retain their leaves all year unless a hard frost strikes. Places where it may be seen include [[Dr. Howard A. Kelly Park]], [[Lake Eola Park]], [[Spring Hammock Preserve]], and\nthe [[University of Central Florida Arboretum]].\n\n== Cultivation and use ==\n''Liriodendron tulipifera'' grows readily from seeds, which should be sown in a fine soft mould, and in a cool and shady situation. If sown in autumn they come up the succeeding spring, but if sown in spring they often remain a year in the ground.  [[John Claudius Loudon|Loudon]] says that seeds from the highest branches of old trees are most likely to germinate. It is readily propagated from cuttings and easily transplanted.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n=== In landscaping ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ECF Liriodendron.jpg|thumb|Flower of east central Florida ecotype near [[Lake Worth, Florida]]. Flower is smaller and yellower than in most northern upland types.]]  -->\nTulip trees make magnificently shaped specimen trees, and are very large, growing to about {{convert|35|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} in good [[soil]]. They grow best in deep well-drained [[loam]] which has thick dark [[topsoil]]. They show stronger response to [[fertilizer]] compounds (those with low salt index are preferred) than most other trees, but soil structure and organic matter content are more important. In the wild it is occasionally seen around [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] outcrops.<ref>http://www.coacommunity.net/downloads/serpentine08/serpentinegeoecology.pdf</ref> The southeastern coastal plain and east central Florida ecotypes occur in wet but ''not stagnant'' soils which are high in organic matter. All tulip trees are unreliable in clay flats which are subject to ponding and flooding. Like other members of the [[Magnolia]] family, they have fleshy roots that are easily broken if handled roughly. Transplanting should be done in early spring, before leaf-out; this timing is especially important in the more northern areas. Fall planting is often successful in Florida. The east central Florida ecotype may be more easily moved than other strains because its roots grow over nine or ten months every year\u2014several months longer than other ecotypes. Most tulip trees have low tolerance of [[drought]], although Florida natives (especially the east central ecotype) fare better than southeastern coastal plain or northern inland specimens.\n\nIt is recommended as a shade tree.<ref name=Keeler /> The tree's tall and rapid growth is a function of its shade intolerance. Grown in the full sun, the species tends to grow shorter, slower, and rounder, making it adaptable to landscape planting. In forest settings, most investment is made in the trunk (i.e., the branches are weak and easily break off, a sign of axial dominance) and lower branches are lost early as new, higher branches closer to the sun continue the growth spurt upward. A tree just 15 years old may already reach {{convert|40|ft|m|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} in height with no branches within reach of humans standing on the ground.\n\n==== Cultivars ====\n* 'Ardis' \u2013 dwarf, with smaller leaves than wild form.

It is very widely used where a cheap, easy-to-work and stable wood is needed. The [[Heartwood|sapwood]] is usually a creamy off-white color. While the heartwood is usually a pale green, it can take on streaks of red, purple, or even black; depending on the extractives content (i.e. the soil conditions where the tree was grown, etc.). It is clearly the wood of choice for use in [[organ (music)|organs]], due to its ability to take a fine, smooth, precisely cut finish and so to effectively seal against [[organ pipe|pipes]] and [[valve]]s. It is also commonly used for siding clapboards. Its wood may be compared in texture, strength, and softness to [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]].\n\nUsed for interior finish of houses, for siding, for panels of carriages, for coffin boxes, pattern timber, and wooden ware. During scarcity of the better qualities of white pine, tulip wood has taken its place to some extent, particularly when very wide boards are required.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nIt also has a reputation for being resistant to termites, and in the Upland South (and perhaps elsewhere) house and barn sills were often made of tulip poplar beams.\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe tulip tree has been referenced in many poems and the namesakes of other poems, such as [[William Stafford (poet)|William Stafford]]'s \"Tulip Tree.\"<ref>Stafford, William. Stories That Could Be True. New York: Harper & Row, 1977. Print.</ref>\n\nAnother form of art that the tulip tree is a major part of is wood carving. The tulip poplar can be very useful and has been one of the favorite types of trees for wood carving by sculptors such as Wilhelm Schimmel and Shields Landon Jones.<ref>\"SCHIMMEL, WILHELM (1817\u20131890).\" The Encyclopedia of American Folk Art.

It is a large forest [[tree]] of the [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] [[United States]] and [[Southern Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It is a tree that tends to occur singly as scattered specimens, rather than in groves.<ref name=sternberg>Sternberg, G., & Wilson, J. (2004). Native Trees for North American Landscapes. Portland, Oregon:Timber Press</ref>\n\nThe cucumber tree is native primarily within the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] belt, including the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and [[Cumberland Plateau]], up to western [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. There are also numerous disconnected outlying populations through much of the southeastern U.S., and a few small populations in [[Southern Ontario|Southern]] [[Ontario]]. In Canada, the cucumber tree is listed as an [[endangered]] species and is protected under the Canadian [[Species at Risk Act]].<ref name=white>White, D.J. (2000). Update COSEWIC Status Report on the Cucumber Tree ''Magnolia acuminata'' in Canada. Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada. Ottawa, Ontario</ref>  In 1993 The [[North American Native Plant Society]] purchased Shining Tree Woods to preserve a stand of ''Magnolia acuminata,'' which is also known as \"The Shining Tree\".\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are [[deciduous]] simple and alternate, oval to oblong, 12\u201325&nbsp;cm long and 6\u201312&nbsp;cm wide, with smooth margins and downy on the underside. They come in two forms, acuminate at both ends, or moderately cordate at the base (these are usually only formed high in the tree).\n\n{{Gallery\n|File:Magnolia acuminata leaves 01 by Line1.jpg|Leaves\n|Image:Cucumber magnolia.jpg|Fruit\n|File:Cucumber Magnolia Magnolia acuminata Bark Vertical.JPG|Bark\n|File:Cucumber_tree_sections.jpg|Sections of timber from ''[[The American Woods]]''\n}}\n\nUnlike most magnolias, the [[flower]]s are not showy. They are typically small, yellow-green, and borne high in the tree in April through June. The leaves of Magnolia acuminata are pointed at the tip and provide it with its name - 'acuminate' means tapering to a fine point. The name Cucumber Tree refers to the unripe [[fruit]], which is green and often shaped like a small [[cucumber]]; the fruit matures to a dark red color and is 6\u20138&nbsp;cm long and 4&nbsp;cm broad, with the individual carpels splitting open to release the bright red [[seed]]s, 10-60 per fruit. The ripe fruit is a striking reddish orange color.\n\n== Uses and cultivation ==\nCucumber trees are excellent shade trees for [[park]]s and [[garden]]s, though they are not recommended for use as street trees. In cultivation, they typically only grow {{convert|15|\u2013|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, although they reach over {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} in ideal [[forest]] situations. They can become quite massive: the United States national (and presumed world) champion in [[Stark County, Ohio]] measures eight feet (2.4 m) in diameter and {{convert|96|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall. They grow best in deep, moist, well-drained [[soil]]s that are slightly [[acidic]] although they are tolerant of [[alkali]]ne [[soils]].\n\nThey are tricky to [[Transplanting|transplant]] due to their coarse, fleshy [[root|root system]] and should be planted shallow and moved in early spring with a good soil ball.\n\nIn the [[timber]] trade, the wood of this tree is interchangeable with that of the related [[Liriodendron|tuliptree]] (''Liriodendron tulipifera'').\n\n''Magnolia acuminata'' has been used in hybridizing new varieties that share its yellow flower color and cold hardiness\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/maac.htm ''Magnolia acuminata'' images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu]\n*[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233500766 Flora of North America: ''Magnolia acuminata'']\n*[http://www.efloras.org/object_page.aspx?object_id=6419&flora_id=1 Flora of N.Amer-RangeMap: ''Magnolia acuminata'']\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=MAAC NRCS-USDA Plants Profile: ''Magnolia acuminata'']\n*[http://remarkabletree.cnre.vt.edu/detail.cfm?AutofieldforPrimaryKey=1249 ''Famous example at Violet Banks in Virginia'' posted at remarkabletree.cnre.vt.edu]\n\n{{Commons category}}\n\n[[Category:Magnolia|acuminata]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Southeastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1759]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Trees of humid continental climate]]",

The Appalachian plants are classified as ''Magnolia fraseri'' var. ''fraseri,'' and the more coastal plants as ''M. fraseri'' var. ''pyramidata.''  These two kinds of magnolia are often recognized as distinct species, ''M. fraseri'' and ''M. pyramidata,'' respectively.\n\nFraser magnolia is a small, [[deciduous]] [[tree]] growing to 14&nbsp;m (40&nbsp;ft) tall, as a basal-branching, fragrant plant, with brown [[bark]] with a \"warty\" or \"scaly\" texture. The [[leaf|leaves]] are quite large, 15\u201325&nbsp;cm (rarely up to 53&nbsp;cm) long and 8\u201318&nbsp;cm (rarely up to 29&nbsp;cm) broad, with a pair of [[leaf shape|auricles]] (or \"ear-lobes\") at the base and an entire margin; they are green above and glaucous blue-green below. The showy white [[flower]]s are 16\u201325&nbsp;cm in diameter with nine [[tepal]]s; they open in late spring or early summer, after the foliage. The [[fruit]] is a woody, oblong, cone-like structure (like all Magnolias) 6.5\u201312&nbsp;cm long, covered in small, pod-like follicles each containing one or two red seeds that hang out from the cone by a slender thread when ripe. A good seed crop occurs only about every 4\u20135 years. Reproduction is accomplished by both [[seed]] and [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative sprouts]]. The fruit is eaten by wildlife, helping disperse the seeds.\n\nThis tree grows best on rich, moist, well-drained soil. The very large showy white flowers and large-leaved, coarse-textured foliage make this an attractive [[ornamental plant|ornamental tree]], but otherwise it has little commercial value. It is sometimes cultivated in North America as a native alternative to exotic magnolias, and can be grown a considerable distance north of its natural range if given conditions favorable to its growth.\n\nThere are two [[variety (botany)|varieties]]:\n*''Magnolia fraseri'' var. ''fraseri'', native to the Appalachian Mountains.\n*''Magnolia fraseri'' var. ''pyramidata'' (Bartram) Pampanini, from the [[Coastal Plain]]. The vernacular name for this variety is '''Pyramid magnolia'''.\n\nThe [[bigleaf magnolia]] ''(Magnolia macrophylla)'' also has auriculate-lobed leaves.\n\nFraser Magnolia is named for the Scottish botanist [[John Fraser (botanist)|John Fraser]] (1750\u20131811), who collected extensively in the Appalachian Mountains.\n\n[[File:magnoliafraseri rt1.jpg|thumb|none|300px|''M. fraseri'' in young forest, south of Spruce Knob, West Virginia, USA.]]\n[[File:magnoliafraseri rt2.jpg|thumb|none|300px|''M. fraseri'' flower and foliage.

Farther south, it is grown more widely in Delaware, much of the Chesapeake Bay region in Maryland, and much of eastern Virginia. On the West Coast, it can be grown as far north as British Columbia/Seattle area, though cooler summers on the West Coast slow growth compared to the East Coast.<ref name=Call99/>\n\nIn the interior of the US, some of the cold-hardy [[cultivars]] have survived north to the southern Ohio Valley (Ohio, Kentucky, southern Indiana).

This species boasts the largest simple [[leaf]] and single [[flower]] of any native plant in North America.\n\n==Classification==\n[[Image:M.macrophylla var. ashei 200706.jpg|thumb|left|''M. macrophylla'' var. ''ashei'' flower in female phase.]]\n''Magnolia macrophylla'' has three subspecies; some botanists treat these plants as three separate [[species]]:\n\n*''Magnolia macrophylla'' subsp. ''macrophylla''. '''Bigleaf magnolia'''. Southeastern United States. Secure. Tree to 20 m; leaves 50\u201390&nbsp;cm long, fruit 4\u201310&nbsp;cm long with more than 50 carpels.\n*''Magnolia macrophylla'' subsp. ''ashei'' (Wetherby) Spongberg. '''Ashe magnolia'''. Northwest [[Florida]]. Shrub or small tree to 12 m; leaves 25\u201360&nbsp;cm long, fruit 4\u20135&nbsp;cm long with less than 50 carpels.  Considered by some botanists to be a distinct species, ''Magnolia ashei.''\n*''Magnolia macrophylla'' subsp. ''dealbata'' (Zuccarini) J. D. Tobe. '''Mexican bigleaf magnolia''' or '''Cloudforest magnolia'''. Mexico ([[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] to [[Oaxaca]] and [[Veracruz]], in [[cloud forest]]s). Tree to 20 m; leaves 30\u201360&nbsp;cm long, fruit 8\u201315&nbsp;cm long with more than 70 carpels.  Considered by some botanists to be a distinct species, ''Magnolia dealbata.''\n\n== Description ==\nBigleaf magnolia is medium-sized understory [[tree]] 15\u201320 m tall, though some individuals over 27m tall (and over 100&nbsp;cm circumference) <ref>See thread on an ENTS trip report in Roswell, GA here: http://www.ents-bbs.org/viewtopic.php?f=73&t=2133</ref> have been documented by the [https://www.nativetreesociety.org/ Eastern Native Tree Society].  This species is distinguished from other magnolias by the large [[leaf]] size, 25\u201380&nbsp;cm long and 11\u201330&nbsp;cm broad. The tree's branches often bend under the weight of this heavy foliage.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nBigleaf magnolia is found in rich [[Mesic habitat|mesic]] woods; any disturbance that lets more light reach the ground is beneficial to the establishment of bigleaf magnolia, but despite its relatively fast growth-rate when stimulated by more light, other understory and canopy trees/seedlings are usually able to outgrow and out-compete it. This suits the plant just fine as it is tolerant of low light levels; it does not need full sun to survive once established (however, it does not tolerate full shade). Natural regeneration is quite limited due to the scarcity of mature, seed-bearing plants and the fact that this tree's population mostly consists of widely scattered individuals. In addition, this species is plagued by poor seed set (most likely from limiting factors mentioned above) and low seed [[:wikt:viable|viability]], a trait shared by its cousin and frequent associate in the wild in [[Appalachia]], the ''[[Magnolia fraseri|Fraser magnolia]].''\n\nThe Ashe magnolia is a rare [[shrub]], exceptionally a small tree, that is found only along the bluffs and ravines adjacent to the [[Apalachicola River]] in [[Florida]], along with several other rare plants unique to the area, such as [[Taxus floridana|Florida Yew]] and [[Torreya taxifolia|Florida torreya]]. It resembles the typical subsp. ''macrophylla'', but has shorter, broader leaves, smaller [[flower]]s, and longer [[fruit]]s. The {{convert|6|to|8|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}} flowers bloom in late spring, and are white with rose-purple blotches on the inner tepals. The fruit is eaten by wildlife, but because of the plant's scarceness, it does not form a significant portion of any creature's [[diet (nutrition)|diet]].\n\nIn the southeastern United States, especially [[Alabama]] and surrounding areas, ''Magnolia macrophylla'' is sometimes called the \"cowcumber magnolia,\" in contrast with the much smaller-leaved [[Magnolia acuminata|cucumber-tree magnolia]], ''M. acuminata.''\n\n==Threats==\nCollection, both legal and illegal, may have an adverse impact on this tree's population due to low [[population density]], and high [[Collecting|collection]] pressure can [[extirpate]] this species locally.  Bigleaf magnolia is listed as [[threatened]] in [[North Carolina]] and [[endangered]] in [[Arkansas]] and [[Ohio]].  The [[Florida Department of Agriculture]] lists the Ashe magnolia as [[endangered]], due to its small population and restricted range.\n\n==Cultivation==\nBigleaf magnolia is often short-lived under cultivation unless its rather demanding requirements are met. This tree likes loose, undisturbed rich mesic soil (or mulch and compost substitutes) in  full sun or part shade with plenty of moisture. This tree will likely succeed in sites that closely mimic its natural habitat and where it is protected from strong wind which can tatter its large foliage. It can be grown farther north than its southernly range suggests, but needs watering during extended dry periods. This plant is generally problem free.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Bigleaf_Magnolia_Magnolia_macrophylla_Leaf_2500px.jpg|A single large leaf\nImage:Bigleaf Magnolia Magnolia macrophylla Sapling 1550px.jpg| A sapling\nImage:Magnolia macrophylla bigleaf magnolia.JPG| Naturalized tree\n</gallery>\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Magnolia macrophylla}}\n*[http://www.michaux.org/magnolia.htm An ecological study of Magnolia macrophylla in Gaston County, NC ]\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/mama2.htm ''Magnolia macrophylla'' images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu]\n*[http://www.fnai.org/FieldGuide/pdf/Magnolia_ashei.PDF Field Guide to the Rare Plants and Animals of Florida Online:  Magnolia ashei]\n*[http://www.treetrail.net/magnolia.html Magnolia macrophylla Distribution Map]\n*[http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/magnolia-macrophylla-bigleaf-magnolia-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map of ''Magnolia macrophylla'']\n*[http://www.ents-bbs.org/viewtopic.php?f=73&t=2133]\n\n[[Category:Magnolia|macrophylla]]\n[[Category:Endangered flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Northeastern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

It was the first magnolia to be scientifically described under modern rules of botanical [[nomenclature]], and is the type species of the genus ''Magnolia''; as ''Magnolia'' is also the type genus of all [[flowering plant]]s (magnoliophytes), this species in a sense typifies all flowering plants.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Catesby Natural History of Carolina plate 39 Magnolia virginiana and Blue Grosbeak.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mark Catesby]] (1731), ''Natural History of Carolina'' etc., plate 39, with Magnolia lauri folio, subtus albicante, the Sweet Bay (Magnolia virginiana) and ''Coccothraustes coeruleus'', the [[Blue Grosbeak]] (Passerina caerulea).]]\n\n''Magnolia virginiana'' is an [[evergreen]] or [[deciduous]] [[tree]] to 30 m (100 ft) tall, native to the lowlands and swamps of the Atlantic coastal plain of the eastern [[United States]]. The original native range is thought to be from the eastern Gulf Coast to Long Island, New York. Whether it is deciduous or evergreen depends on climate; it is evergreen in areas with milder winters in the south of its range (zone 7 southward), and is semi-evergreen or deciduous further north. The leaves are alternate, simple (not lobed or pinnate), with entire margins, 6-12 cm long, and 3-5 cm wide. The bark is smooth and gray, with the inner bark mildly scented, the scent reminiscent of the [[bay laurel]] spice.\n\nThe flowers are creamy white, 8-14 cm diameter, with 6-15 petal-like [[tepal]]s. The flowers carry a very strong vanilla scent that can sometimes be noticed several hundred yards away.  The fruit is a fused aggregate of follicles, 3-5 cm long, pinkish-red when mature, with the follicles splitting open to release the 1 cm long seeds. The [[seeds]] are black but covered by a thinly fleshy red coat, which is attractive to some [[fruit]]-eating [[bird]]s; these swallow the seeds, digest the red coating, and disperse the seeds in their droppings.\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Magnolia virginiana'' is often grown as an ornamental tree in gardens, and used in horticultural applications to give an architectural feel to landscape designs.  It is an attractive tree for [[park]]s and large [[garden]]s, grown for its large, conspicuous, scented flowers, for its clean, attractive foliage, and for its fast growth. In warmer areas Magnolia virginiana is valued for its evergreen foliage. \n\nThe English botanist and missionary [[John Banister (naturalist)|John Banister]] collected ''Magnolia virginiana'' in the southeastern United States in 1678<!--1688 in Coats--> and sent it to [[England]], where it flowered for [[Henry Compton (bishop) |Bishop Henry Compton]].

        "text": "The '''Florida mangroves''' [[ecoregion]], of the [[mangrove|mangrove forest]] [[biome]], comprise an [[ecosystem]] along the coasts of the [[Florida]] [[peninsula]], and the [[Florida Keys]].\n\n==Florida's mangrove species==\nThe Florida mangroves ecoregion includes three [[mangrove]] species:[[File:Red mangrove-everglades natl park.jpg|thumb|left|Red mangrove tree in Everglades National Park]]\n* '''''[[Rhizophora mangle]]''''' \u2014 red mangrove\nRed mangroves are characterized by a dendritic network of aerial prop roots extending into the soil. This allows them to live in anaerobic conditions by providing gas exchange. They attain 82\u2013125 feet in height in deltas and 26\u201333 feet along shoreline.The bark is gray on the outside with a red interior. These trees also have small white flowers that are wind pollinated with 10-12 inch long pencil shaped seeds.<ref name=\"USFWS\">US Fish and Wildlife Service. (1999). South Florida Multi-Species Recovery Plan.</ref>\n\n[[File:Black Mangrove (Avicennia germinans) (7270558948).jpg|thumb|right|Black mangrove flower]][[File:Saltcrystals on avicennia marina var resinifera leaves.JPG|thumb|left|Excreted salt on the underside of a mangrove leaf]]\n* '''''[[Avicennia germinans]]''''' \u2014 black mangrove\nBlack mangrove trees grow to a heights of 133 feet and average 66 feet. They are characterized by vertically erect aerating branches ([[pneumatophores]]) extending up to 20&nbsp;cm above the soil. The bark is dark and scaly and the upper surface of the leaves is often covered with salt excreted by the plant. This tree has white flowers that are bilaterally symmetrical and pollinated by [[Hymenoptera]] and is the source of mangrove honey. The seed is a shaped and sized similar to a lima bean when germinated. Younger black mangrove trees are shade intolerant but become more shade tolerant as they mature.<ref name=\"USFWS\"/>\n\n* '''''[[Laguncularia racemosa]]''''' \u2014 white mangrove\nWhite mangrove trees grow to 45 feet in height and up and tend to have a more erect form than the other species. Thy have erect, blunt-tipped pneumatophores that are used if they are growing in anaerobic conditions. The bark is white, relatively smooth and the leaves are oval shaped and flattened. Small yellowish flowers are located on the terminal ends of the branches. These may germinate into football shaped propagules. However this may not occur if they are in the northern part of their range.<ref name=\"USFWS\"/>\n\n* ''[[Conocarpus erectus]]'' \u2014 buttonwood (one species that is variously classified as a mangrove or a mangrove associate)\n\nButtonwoods grow 39 to 46 feet tall but do not produce a true [[propagule]] in Florida. Tiny brownish flowers are located at the terminal ends of the branches forming a seed cluster known as the button. These trees are able to grow in areas seldom inundated by tidal water. Two glands are located at the apex of the [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] (leaf stalk) and excrete excess salts and [[Extrafloral nectary|extrafloral nectar]].<ref name=\"USFWS\"/>\n\n==Zonation==\nAll three mangrove species flower in the spring and early summer. Propagules fall from late summer through early autumn.<ref name=\"USFWS\"/> These plants have differing adaptions to conditions along coasts, and are generally found in partially overlapping bands or zones, roughly parallel to the shoreline. The red mangrove grows closest to open water. It has multiple prop roots, which may help to stabilize the soil around its roots. Further inland is the black mangrove lacking prop roots, but does have [[Aerial root#Pneumatophores|pneumatophore]]s, which grow up from the roots to above the water level. The white mangrove grows further inland. It may have prop roots and/or pneumatophores, depending on conditions where it is growing. The buttonwood grows in shallow, [[brackish water]], [[Florida swamps]], or on dry land (the furthest inland).\n[[File:Florida mangrove zonation.jpg|center|600px|Inland distribution of mangrove species]]\n\n[[File:Rhizophora mangle-propagules.jpg|thumb|left|Attached propagules of the viviparous mangrove tree Rhizophora mangle, Bragan\u00e7a, en:Par\u00e1, North Brazil]][[File:Rhizophora mangle MHNT.BOT.2010.12.12.jpg|thumb|right|Red mangrove tree fruits and propagules]]\n\n==Reproductive strategy==\nMangroves have a unique reproductive strategy for a plant. Like mammals they are viviparious, bringing forth live young.\nInstead of dormant seeds, they produce propagules that have embryonic development while still attached to the tree and only release at the appropriate time into water. Once released from tree they require various dispersal times or an \"obligate dispersal periods\" (5\u201340 days depending upon the species) where the embryonic development continues. Once a favorable site is found there is a \u201cobligate stranding period\u201d before a tree emerges and begins to grow.\n\n[[Image:FL-Mangrove-dist.PNG|right|upright=2.0|The distribution of the mangrove community in Florida is shown in red. Cedar Keys and Ponce de Leon Inlet are the northern limits of the mangrove community.]]\n\n==Distribution==\nFlorida mangrove plant communities covered an estimated 430,000 to 540,000 [[acre]]s (1,700 to 2,200&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) in Florida in 1981. Ninety percent of the Florida mangroves are in southern Florida, in [[Collier County, Florida|Collier]], [[Lee County, Florida|Lee]], [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] and [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe]] Counties.\n\nApproximately 280,000 acres (1,100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of mangrove forests are in the hands of the [[United States|Federal]], [[Florida|State]] and local governments, and of private, non-profit organizations. Most of those acres are in [[Everglades National Park]]. Mangroves cover a wide band all along the southern end of the Florida peninsula facing on [[Florida Bay]], from [[Key Largo]] across to close to [[Flamingo, Florida|Flamingo]], then inland behind the beaches and marl prairies of [[Cape Sable]] and all around [[Whitewater Bay]]. From Whitewater Bay, a broad band of mangroves extends up the Gulf coast to [[Marco Island, Florida|Marco Island]], including the [[Ten Thousand Islands]].\n\nMangroves also extend throughout the Florida Keys, although coverage has been reduced due to development. Florida Bay is dotted with small islands, which are often no more than mud flats or shoals more or less covered by mangroves. [[Biscayne Bay]] also has extensive mangroves, but the northern part of the Bay has been largely cleared of mangroves to make way for urban development. Mangrove coverage is limited elsewhere, with the largest areas in the [[Indian River Lagoon]] on the east coast, and the [[Caloosahatchee River]], [[Pine Island Sound]] and [[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)|Charlotte Harbor]] estuaries and [[Tampa Bay]] on the west coast.\n\n===Preferred climate=== \nMangroves are [[Tropics|tropical]] plants, killed by freezing temperatures. These trees can range about halfway up the coast of the Florida peninsula due to mild winter climate and the moderating effect of the warm waters of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on the west coast and the [[Gulf Stream]] and Atlantic Ocean on the east coast. The Florida mangrove community is found as far north as [[Cedar Key, Florida|Cedar Key]] on the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf coast]] of Florida, and as far north as the [[Ponce Inlet, Florida|Ponce de Leon Inlet]] on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of Florida. Black mangroves can regrow from roots after being killed back by a freeze, and are found by themselves a little further north, to [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]] on the east coast and along the [[Florida Panhandle]] on the Gulf coast. Most of Florida is sub-tropical, making it not ideal for mangroves, so the trees tend to be shorter and the leaves smaller in northern and central Florida than in tropical regions. In deep south Florida and the Florida Keys, the tropical climates allows mangroves to grow larger due to being frost free.<ref name=nhmi>[http://www.nhmi.org/mangroves/index.htm Newfound Harbor Marine Institute: Mangroves] - retrieved June 5, 2006</ref><ref>[http://learningobjects.wesleyan.edu/vieques/fieldguide.php?record=86 Vieques Field Guide: White Mangrove] - retrieved June 6, 2006</ref>\n[[File:Mangrove plants swamp in Florida.jpg|thumb|350px|Florida mangroves in the coastal [[Florida swamps]].]]\n\n===Habitat destruction===\nHuman activity has impacted the mangrove ecoregion in Florida. While the coverage of mangroves at the end of the 20th century is estimated to have decreased only 5% from a century earlier, some localities have seen severe reductions. The [[Lake Worth Lagoon]] lost 87% of its mangroves in the second half of the 20th century, leaving a remnant of just 276 acres (1.12&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). Tampa Bay, home to the busy [[Port of Tampa]], lost over 44% of its wetlands, including mangroves and salt marshes, during the 20th century. Three-quarters of the wetlands along the [[Indian River Lagoon]], including mangroves, were impounded for mosquito control during the 20th century. As of 2001, natural water flow was being restored to some of the wetlands.<ref name=nhmi/><ref name=nps>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070807100550/http://www.nps.gov/archive/ever/ed/resources/edhab.htm Everglades National Park Habitats] - retrieved July 1, 2008</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050309182527/http://sjr.state.fl.us/programs/outreach/pubs/irl_update/01sum02.html Indian River Lagoon Update/Summer 2001 Issue: More marshland now connected to lagoon] - retrieved February 2008</ref>\n\n==Associated fauna and flora==\n\n===Fish===\nThe Florida mangrove system is an important habitat for many species. It provides nursery grounds for young [[fish]], [[crustacean]]s and [[mollusca|mollusks]], and for sport and commercial purposes. Many fish feed in the mangrove forests, including [[common snook|snook]] (''Centropomus undecimalis''), gray or [[mangrove snapper]] (''Lutjanus griseus''), [[schoolmaster snapper]] (''Lutjanus apodus''), [[Atlantic tarpon|tarpon]], [[Carangidae|jack]], [[sheepshead (Archosargus)|sheepshead]], [[red drum]], [[silverside (fish)|hardhead silverside]] (''Atherinomorus stipes''), juvenile [[Marine angelfish|blue angelfish]] (''Holocanthus bermudensis''), juvenile porkfish (''[[Haemulidae|Anisotremus]] virginicus''), [[Hippocampus erectus|lined seahorse]] (''Hippocampus erectus''), [[Barracuda|great barracuda]] (''Sphryaena barracuda''), [[boxfish|scrawled cowfish]] (''Lactophrys quadricornis'') and [[Permit (fish)|permit]] (''Trachinotus falcatus''),  as well as [[shrimp]] and [[clams]]. An estimated 75% of the [[game fish]] and 90% of the [[fishing industry|commercial fish]] species in south Florida depend on the mangrove system.\n\n===Birds===\nThe branches of mangroves serve as roosts and [[rookery|rookeries]] for coastal and wading birds, such as the [[brown pelican]] (''Oelicanus occidentalis''), [[roseate spoonbill]] (''Ajajia ajaia''), [[frigatebird]] (''Fregata magnificans''), [[double-crested cormorant]] (''Phalacrocorax carbo''), [[belted kingfisher]] (''Megaceryle alcyon''), [[noddy (tern)|brown noddy]] (''Anous stolidus''), great white heron and Wurdemann's heron, color phases of the [[great blue heron]] (''Adrea herodias''), [[osprey]] (''Pandion haliaetus''), [[snowy egret]] (''Egretta thula''), [[green heron]] (''Butorides striatus''), [[reddish egret]] (''Dichromanassa rufescens'') and [[greater yellowlegs]] (''Tringa melanoleuca'').\n\n[[File:Nonbreeding Adult Brown Pelican at a Dangerous Bend amid a Mangrove Forest.jpg|thumb|Brown pelican]][[File:Odocoileus viginianus clavium.jpg|thumb|Key deer (''Odocoileus viginianus clavium'')]]\n\n===Endangered species===\n\nFlorida mangroves are also home to the following endangered species:\n*[[Smalltooth sawfish]] (''Pristis pectinata'')\n*[[American crocodile]] (''Crocodylus acutus'')\n*[[Hawksbill sea turtle]] (''Eretmochelys imbricata'')\n*[[Atlantic ridley sea turtle]] (''Lepidochelys kempii'')\n*[[Eastern indigo snake]] (''Drymarchon corais'')\n*Atlantic saltmarsh snake (''Nerodia clarkii taeniata'')\n*Southern bald eagle (''Haliaeetus leucocephalus leucocephalus'')\n*[[Peregrine falcon]] (''Falco columbarius'')\n*[[Barbados yellow warbler]] (''Dendroica petechia petechia'')\n*[[Key deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus clavium'')\n*[[West Indian manatee]] (''Trichechus manatus'')\n[[File:Reef2576 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|left|Hawksbill turtle (''Eretmochelys imbricata'')]][[File:Endangered Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus) (7636814558).jpg|thumb|center|Endangered Florida manatee (''Trichechus manatus'')]]\n\n===Other fauna===\nAbove the water mangroves also shelter and support [[snail]]s, crabs, and [[spider]]s. Below the water's surface, often encrusted on the mangrove roots, are [[sea sponge|sponge]]s, [[sea anemone|anemone]]s, [[coral]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[tunicate]]s, [[mussel]]s, [[starfish]], crabs, and Florida spiny lobster (''[[Panulirus argus]]'').<ref name=nhmi/><ref name=nps/><ref>[http://www.sfrc.ufl.edu/Extension/pubtxt/for43.htm Mangroves-Florida's Coastal Trees] - retrieved June 5, 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.nhmi.org/mangroves/flo.htm Newfound Harbor Marine Institute: Mangroves: Flora & Fauna] - retrieved June 5, 2006</ref>\n\n===Flora===\nThe mangrove branches and trunks support various [[epiphyte]]s, such as [[bromeliads]]. Those of the genus ''[[Tillandsia]]'' found in them include [[Spanish moss]], and [[reindeer lichen]].  Below the water, spaces protected by splayed mangrove roots can shelter [[seagrass]]es.\n\n==Effects of climate change==\n\n[[Climate change]] is a complex issue with numerous variables. The exact severity (such as how much global temperatures will increase) is impossible to predict. The effects of climate change on a species are even more difficult to discern. Despite the intricacy, scientists have formulated several hypotheses of the effects of climate change on the mangroves of southern Florida. The overall hypothesis is that mangroves are vulnerable to climate change, which will affect this ecosystem via three main mechanisms: sea level rise, decreased cold weather events, and increased storm severity. A rise in sea level is expected to affect the range of mangroves, the decrease in cold weather events will allow the range of mangroves to shift further north, and the increase in the severity of storms is anticipated to change the species composition and morphology of the mangroves.\n\n===Sea level rise===\n[[File:Effects of Sea Rise by 2100 on the distribution and species composition of Florida mangroves under low, moderate, and high scenarios.png|right|200x200|Estimated effects of sea level rise on the species composition and distribution of Florida's mangroves by 2100 under low, moderate, and severe scenarios.<ref name=\"Doyle\">Doyle, T.

As climate change continues, this could potentially negatively affect wildlife resources that depend upon freshwater habitats over mangrove habitats, such as the [[Everglades]].<ref name=\"Doyle\"/> The figure at the right shows projections of mangrove distributions under low(15&nbsp;cm), moderate(45&nbsp;cm), and severe(95&nbsp;cm) sea rise scenarios by the year 2100. The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] which was finalized in 2014 is now predicting 52\u201398&nbsp;cm sea level rise by 2100. In addition, this report has often been criticized as underestimating the severity of climate change making it even more likely for the moderate(45&nbsp;cm) or severe(95&nbsp;cm) sea rise scenarios to occur.<ref>Scientific American.

Dec. 2012. http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-the-ipcc-underestimated-climate-change/</ref> Despite the fact mangroves are currently keeping pace with sea level rise, at rates greater than 2.3mm/yr there is potential for mangrove ecosystem failure.

The increase in very hot days will have consequences for human health, drought, and wildfires.]]\nSouthern Florida's mangroves are a tropical species that are limited to the tip of the Florida peninsula and the Florida Keys due to a climate preference. The upper portion of Florida falls into a sub-tropical climate hindering mangrove growth there due to cold weather events such as freezing. Twenty-eight years of satellite imagery has shown that mangroves have shifted their range northward in Florida in response to less harsh winters and less frequent cold events.<ref>Cavanaugh, K. C., Kellner, J. R., Forde, A. J., Gruner, D. S., Parker, J. D., Rodriguez, W., & Feller, I. C. (2014).

M. (2008). Mangrove forests: Resilience, protection from tsunamis, and responses to global climate change. [[Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science]], 76(1), 1\u201313. doi:10.1016/j.ecss.2007.08.024</ref> The loss of mangroves could therefore be detrimental to coastal communities exposed to increased storm surges.\n\n===Ways to promote resilience===\nDue to the potential for the acceleration of sea level rise and increased storm severity in the future due to climate change, mangroves of southern Florida may be in jeopardy. This has implications not only for mangroves forests but also the freshwater habitats they encroach upon and the humans and other animals that depend upon both these ecosystem resources and protection. While there is little local managers can do to prevent large scale changes such as sea rise and increased storm severity, according to the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] and [[The Nature Conservancy]] there are ten strategies land managers can do to increase viability and promote resilience.\n\nThese are:\n*1) Apply risk-spreading strategies to address the uncertainties of climate change. (A range of mangrove habitats should be protected to capture different community types to ensure replenishment following disasters)\n*2) Identify and protect critical areas that are naturally positioned to survive climate change.\n*3) Manage human stresses on mangroves (such as waste, sediment, and nutrient runoff from urban areas and human development).\n*4) Establish greenbelts and buffer zones to allow for mangrove migration in response to sea-level rise, and to reduce impacts from adjacent land-use practices.\n*5) Restore degraded areas that have demonstrated resistance or resilience to climate change.\n*6) Understand and preserve connectivity between mangroves and sources of freshwater and sediment, and between mangroves and their associated habitats like coral reefs and seagrasses (mangroves provide services to coral reef and seagrass systems so coupling them preserving them together helps the other ecosystem succeed).\n*7) Establish baseline data and monitor the response of mangroves to climate change.\n*8) Implement adaptive strategies to compensate for changes in species ranges and environmental conditions (have flexible management plans).\n*9) Develop alternative livelihoods for mangrove dependent communities as a means to reduce mangrove destruction (charcoal production using coconut shells instead of mangroves, and mangrove honey production).\n*10) Build partnerships with a variety of stakeholders to generate the necessary finances and support to respond to the impacts of climate change.<ref>Mcleod, E., & Salm, R.

Swamp tupelo grows chiefly in the coastal plains from Delaware, eastern Maryland, and southeastern Virginia, south to southern Florida and west to eastern Texas. Its range extends north up the Mississippi Valley to southern Arkansas and west and south Tennessee.<ref name=silvics>{{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Nyssa |species=sylvatica |first1=Charles E. |last1=McGee |first2=Kenneth W. |last2=Outcalt}}</ref>\n\nThe swamp tupelo grows in humid warm climates. It not only tolerates flooding but actually thrives under those conditions. It is seldom found on sites that are not inundated much of the growing season. Swamp tupelo grows in headwater [[swamp]]s, [[strand (swamp)|strand]]s, ponds, river bottoms, bays, [[estuary|estuaries]], and low coves. Normally it does not grow in the deeper parts of swamps or overflow river bottoms.<ref name=silvics/>\n\nThe type of water regime is more important to growth of swamp tupelo than the soil type. Best growth is achieved on sites where the soil is continuously saturated with very shallow moving water. Growth can be reduced as much as 50 percent when the water is stagnant, as in ponds. Intermittent flooding, with periodic drying cycles, or continuous deep flooding even by moving water, also reduces growth.<ref name=silvics/>\n\nTrees and shrubs commonly associated with swamp tupelo are [[Acer rubrum|red maple]] (''Acer rubrum''), [[Cephalanthus occidentalis|buttonbush]] (''Cephalanthus occidentalis''), [[Cliftonia monophylla|buckwheat-tree]] (''Cliftonia monophylla''), [[Cornus (genus)|dogwood]] (''Cornus'' spp.), [[Cyrilla racemiflora|swamp cyrilla]] (''Cyrilla racemiflora''), [[Forestiera acuminata|swamp-privet]] (''Forestiera acuminata''), [[Fraxinus caroliniana|Carolina ash]] (''Fraxinus caroliniana''), [[Gordonia lasianthus|loblolly-bay]] (''Gordonia lasianthus''), [[Ilex cassine|dahoon]] (''Ilex cassine''), [[Ilex glabra|inkberry]] (''I. glabra''), [[Ilex vomitoria|yaupon]] (''I. vomitoria''), [[Lyonia lucida|fetterbush lyonia]] (''Lyonia lucida''), and [[Myrica|bayberry]] (''Myrica'' spp.).<ref name=silvics/>\n\nThe swamp tupelo has minute greenish-white flowers that appear in the spring with the leaves, usually in late April. Insects, primarily bees, are the major pollinating vector, but pollen is also spread by wind. The fruit, a [[drupe]], changes from green to a dark blue as it ripens, usually in early November.<ref name=silvics/> The seeds normally overwinter and germinate the following spring. [[Germination]] does not take place under water, but submerged seeds germinate once the water subsides below the soil surface. Germination is rapid in moist, drained conditions at {{convert|21|C|F}} and higher. After germination, seedlings must grow rapidly to keep the [[apex (botany)|apex]] and leaves above water, because prolonged submergence during active growth will kill them. Submergence during the dormant season, however, has no adverse effect.<ref name=silvics/>\n\nSwamp tupelo normally develops a [[taproot]] and has a swollen base to the mean height of the growing season water level. Water [[root]]s, which develop under flooded conditions, help support the tree and capture nutrients. These specialized roots tolerate high [[carbon dioxide]] concentrations, oxidize the [[rhizosphere]], and carry on [[anaerobic respiration]]. Thus, they are the key to the species ability to thrive under flooded conditions.<ref name=silvics/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Black Tupelo]]\n*[[Dogwood]]\n*[[Peppermint Tree]]\n*[[Poison Ivy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Nyssa]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1788]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]",

The name \"tupelo\" is used primarily in the [[Southern United States|American South]]; northward and in [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachia]], the tree is more commonly called the '''black gum''' or the '''sour gum''', although no part of the plant is particularly gummy.<ref name=Werthner /> Both of these names contrast it with a different tree species with a broadly overlapping range, the [[Liquidambar styraciflua|sweet gum ''(Liquidambar styraciflua)'']], which does produce an aromatic resin.<ref name=Werthner />  Another common name used occasionally in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] is ''pepperidge.''<ref name=Werthner />\n\nOn [[Martha's Vineyard]], in [[Massachusetts]], this species is called \"beetlebung\", perhaps for its use in making the mallet known as a beetle, used for hammering [[bung]]s (stoppers) into barrels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://extension.psu.edu/natural-resources/forests/news/2014/why-do-they-call-it-a-gum-tree| author=Paxton, William C. |date=2014|title=Why Do They Call It a Gum Tree?|publisher=Penn State Extension|accessdate=2014-09-14}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n<!---Overlapping parallel descriptions text should be integrated--->\n[[Image:Nyssa sylvatica JPG1b.jpg|right|thumb|''Nyssa sylvatica'' leaves in the autumn.]]\n[[File:NyssaSylvaticaTrunk.jpg|thumb|right|Trunk of a mature ''Nyssa sylvatica'' tree]]\n''Nyssa sylvatica'' grows to {{convert|20|-|25|m|ft}} tall, rarely to {{convert|35|m|ft}}, with a trunk diameter of {{convert|50|-|100|cm|in}}, rarely up to {{convert|170|cm|in}}. These trees typically have a straight trunk with the branches extending outward at right angles.<ref name=Werthner />  The [[bark]] is dark gray and flaky when young, but it becomes furrowed with age, resembling [[alligator]] hide on very old stems. The twigs of this tree are reddish-brown, usually hidden by a greyish skin. The pith is chambered with greenish partitions.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] of this species are variable in size and shape. They can be oval, elliptical, or obovate, and {{convert|5|\u2013|12|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long. They have lustrous upper surfaces, with entire, often wavy margins. The foliage turns purple in autumn, eventually becoming an intense bright scarlet. Deer are extremely fond of the leaves on seedlings and saplings, to the point where large populations of them can make establishment of the tree almost impossible. For comparison, mature trees are largely left alone.\n\nThe [[flower]]s are very small, in greenish-white in clusters at the top of a long stalk and a rich source or nectar for bees. They are often [[dioecious]] so a male and female tree in proximity is required to set seed, however, many trees are also [[Polygamo-dioecious#Polygamous|polygamo-dioecious]], which means they have both male and female flowers on the same tree. The [[fruit]] is a black-blue, ovoid stone fruit, about 10&nbsp;mm long with a thin, oily, bitter-to-sour tasting flesh and very popular with small bird species. There are from one to three fruits together on a long slender stalk. They are a valuable energy food for birds, especially the [[American robin]].\n\n''Nyssa sylvatica'' forms a large deep taproot when young that makes transplanting difficult. Because of this, it is fairly uncommon in cultivation and the nursery trade.\n\nAdditional characteristics include:\n* Bark: Light reddish brown, deeply furrowed and scaly. Branchlets at first pale green to orange, sometimes smooth, often downy, later dark brown.\n* Wood: Pale yellow, sapwood white; heavy, strong, very tough, hard to split, not durable in contact with the soil. Used for turnery. Sp. gr., 0.6353; weight of cu. ft., 39.59.\n* Winter buds: Dark red, obtuse, one-fourth of an inch long. Inner scales enlarge with the growing shoot, becoming red before they fall.\n* Leaves: Alternate, often crowded at the end of the lateral branches, simple, linear, oblong to oval, two to five inches (127&nbsp;mm)  long, one-half to three inches (76&nbsp;mm)  broad, wedge-shaped or rounded at base, entire, with margin slightly thickened, acute or acuminate. They come out of the bud conduplicate, coated beneath with rusty tomentum, when full grown are thick, dark green, very shining above, pale and often hairy beneath. Feather-veined, midrib and primary veins prominent beneath. In autumn they turn bright scarlet, or yellow and scarlet. Petioles one-quarter to one-half an inch long, slender or stout, terete or margined, often red.\n* Flowers: May, June, when leaves are half grown. Polygamodi\u0153cious, yellowish green, borne on slender downy peduncles. Staminate in many-flowered heads; pistillate in two to several flowered clusters.\n* Calyx: Cup-shaped, five-toothed.\n* Corolla: Petals five, imbricate in bud, yellow green, ovate, thick, slightly spreading, inserted on the margin of the conspicuous disk.\n* Stamens: Five to twelve. In staminate flowers exserted, in pistillate short, often wanting.\n* Pistil: Ovary inferior, one to two-celled; style stout, exserted, reflexed above the middle. Entirely wanting in sterile flower. Ovules, one in each cell.\n* Fruit: Fleshy drupe, one to three from each flower cluster. Ovoid, two-thirds of an inch long, dark blue, acid. Stone more or less ridged.

Its flowers are an important source of [[honey]] and its [[fruit]]s are important to many [[bird]] species. Hollow trunks provide nesting or denning opportunities for [[bee]]s and various [[mammals]]. It is the longest living non-clonal flowering plant in Eastern North America, capable of obtaining ages of over 650 years.<ref>http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~adk/oldlisteast/#spp Eastern OLDLIST</ref>\n\n===Habitats===\n''Nyssa sylvatica'' is found in a wide range of climates, due to its extensive distribution. It commonly grows in both the creek bottoms of the southern coastal plains, to altitudes of about {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in the [[Appalachian Mountains|Southern Appalachians]].<!---Elevation range in Mexico?--->  These trees grow best on well-drained, light-textured soils on the low ridges of second bottoms and on the high flats of silty alluvium. In the uplands it grows best on the loams and clay loams of lower slopes and coves.\n\nThe species occurs 35 different forest cover types.<ref name=\"Black Tupelo\"/> When found on drier upper slopes and ridges, it is seldom of log size or quality.<ref name=\"Black Tupelo\"/><!---But of log size in richer habitats?--->\n\n===Wildlife===\n[[Image:Nyssa sylvatica with mature fruit.jpg|right|thumb|''Nyssa sylvatica'' with mature fruit, starting to show fall coloring]]\n''Nyssa sylvatica'' is an important food source for many migrating birds in the fall. Its early color change ([[foliar fruit flagging]]) is thought to attract birds to the available fruit, which ripen before many other fall fruits and berries. The fruit is quite marked, dark blue, in clusters of two or three. The sour fruits are eagerly sought by many kinds of birds, including: [[American robin]], [[Swainson's thrush]], [[gray-cheeked thrush]], [[hermit thrush]], [[wood thrush]], [[northern cardinal]], [[northern mockingbird]], [[blue jay]], [[red-bellied woodpecker]], [[yellow-bellied sapsucker]], [[northern flicker]], [[pileated woodpecker]], [[eastern phoebe]], [[brown thrasher]], [[eastern bluebird]], [[European starling]], [[scarlet tanager]], [[gray catbird]], [[cedar waxwing]], and [[American crow]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} all primarily eastern North American birds migrating or residing year-round within the tree's range.\n\nThe limbs of these trees often deteriorate early, and the decayed holes make excellent dens for [[squirrel]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[Virginia opossum]]s, as well as nesting sites for [[honeybee]]s.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:2014-11-02 12 47 05 Black Tupelo during autumn at The College of New Jersey in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|right|thumb|''Nyssa sylvatica'' turning scarlet in autumn]]\n\n===Cultivation===\n''Nyssa sylvatica''  is cultivated as an [[ornamental tree]] in parks and large gardens, where it is often used as a specimen or shade tree. The tree is best when grown in sheltered but not crowded positions, developing a pyramidal shape in youth, and spreading with age. The stem rises to the summit of the tree in one tapering unbroken shaft, the branches come out at right angles to the trunk and either extend horizontally or droop a little, making a long-narrow, cone-like head.\n\nThe leaves are short-petioled and so have little individual motion, but the branches sway as a whole. The spray is fine and abundant and lies horizontally so that the foliage arrangement is not unlike that of the [[beech]] ''(Fagus)''. Its often spectacular autumnal coloring, with intense reds to purples, is highly valued in landscape settings. It is the most fiery and brilliant of the 'brilliant group' that includes [[Acer (genus)|maple]], [[Cornus (plant)|dogwood]], [[sassafras]], and [[Liquidambar|sweet gum]], as well as various species of [[tupelo]].<ref name=Keeler />\n\n===Honey production===\n''Nyssa sylvatica'' is a major source of wild honey in many areas within its range. Hollow sections of black gum trunks were formerly used as [[Beehive|bee gums]] by [[beekeeper]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Crane, Ethel Eva|title=The World History of Beekeeping and Honey Hunting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVh3AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA305|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=305}}</ref>\n\n===Wood===\nThe wood of ''Nyssa sylvatica'' is heavy, hard, cross-grained, and difficult to split, especially after drying. This resistance to splitting led to its use for making [[mallet|maul]]s, [[pulley]]s, [[wheel|wheel hub]]s, [[roller (agricultural tool)|agricultural roller]]s, [[bowl (vessel)|bowl]]s, and [[road surface|paving blocks]].<ref name=Werthner />  The wood is also used for pallets, rough floors, pulpwood, and firewood. Since the wood is very tough, resistant to wear, it has been used for [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttles]] in weaving.\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Nyssa sylvatica}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n* [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=NYSY USDA Plant Profile - ''Nyssa sylvatica'']\n* {{ThePlantList}}\n* [http://www.fw.vt.edu/dendro/dendrology/syllabus/nsylvatica.htm Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Source]\n* [http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hcs/TMI/Plantlist/ny_atica.html Ohio State University Source]\n* [http://www.hrt.msu.edu/ash.alt/tupelo.htm Michigan State University Source]\n* [http://www.hort.net/profile/nys/nyssy/ Hort.net profile]\n* [http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/nysy.htm ''Nyssa sylvatica'' images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu]\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/nyssa-sylvatica-black-tupelo-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map for Nyssa sylvatica]\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nyssa Sylvatica}}\n[[Category:Nyssa]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Hidalgo (state)]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puebla]]\n[[Category:Trees of Veracruz]]\n[[Category:Trees of Chiapas]]\n[[Category:Trees of humid continental climate]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

The [[fruit]] is a small woody [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]]. The [[root]]s are shallow, and the tree grows best when there is little root competition; it also requires [[acid]]ic soils for successful growth. The leaves can be chewed (but should not be swallowed) to help alleviate a dry-feeling mouth.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Sourwood raceme Keeler.png|60px|thumb|[[Raceme]] of flowers]]\nThe bark is gray with a reddish tinge, deeply furrowed and scaly. Branchlets at first are light yellow green, but later turn reddish brown. The wood is reddish brown, with paler [[Wood#Heartwood and sapwood|sapwood]]; it is heavy, hard, and close-grained, and will take a high polish. Its specific gravity is 0.7458, with a density of 46.48&nbsp;lb/cu ft.\n\nThe winter buds are axillary, minute, dark red, and partly immersed in the bark. Inner scales enlarge when spring growth begins.\nLeaves are alternate, four to seven inches long, 1.5 to 2.5&nbsp;inches wide, oblong to ablanceolate, wedge-shaped at the base, serrate, and acute or [[Leaf shape|acuminate]]. Leaf veins are [[Leaf#Venation (arrangement of the veins)|Feather-veined]], the [[midrib]] is conspicuous. They emerge from the bud revolute, bronze green and shining, and smooth; when full grown, they are dark green, shining above, and pale and glaucous below. In autumn, they turn bright scarlet. Petioles are long and slender, with stipules wanting. They are heavily laden with acid.\n\nIn June and July, perfect, cream-white flowers are borne in terminal panicles of secund racemes seven to eight inches long; rachis and short pedicels are downy. The calyx is five-parted and persistent; [[Lobe (anatomy)|lobes]] are [[Aestivation (botany)|valvate]] in bud. The corolla is ovoid-cylindric, narrowed at the throat, cream-white, and five-toothed. The 10 stamens are inserted on the corolla; filaments are wider than the anthers; anthers are two-celled. The pistil is ovary superior, ovoid, and five-celled; the style is columnar; the stigma is simple; the disk is ten-toothed, and ovules are many.\n\nThe fruit is a capsule, downy, five-valved, five-angled, and tipped by the persistent style; the pedicels are curving.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book\n  | last =Keeler\n  | first =Harriet L.\n  | title =Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them\n  | publisher =Charles Scribner's Sons\n  | year =1900\n  | location =New York\n  | pages =192\u2013194 }}</ref>\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\nThe sourwood is perfectly hardy in the north and a worthy [[Ornamental plant#Trees|ornamental tree]] in lawns and parks. Its late bloom makes it desirable, and its autumnal coloring is particularly beautiful and brilliant.

They can be eaten fresh or used in cooking, particularly in sweet desserts. One of the most common desserts with the pecan as a central ingredient is the [[pecan pie]], a traditional [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|Southern U.S. dish]].

Outside the United States, pecans are grown in [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], and [[South Africa]]. They can be grown from [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[hardiness zones]] approximately 5 to 9, provided summers are also hot and humid.\n\nPecan trees may live and bear edible seeds for more than 300 years. They are mostly [[self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatible]], because most [[cultivars]] are clones derived from wild trees which show incomplete [[Sequential hermaphroditism#Flowering plants|dichogamy]]. Generally, two or more trees of different cultivars must be present to pollinate each other.{{clear|left}}\n\nChoosing cultivars can be a complex practice, based on the Alternate Bearing Index (ABI) and their period of pollinating.  Commercial planters are most concerned with the ABI, which describes a cultivar's likelihood to bear on  alternating years (index of 1.0 signifies highest likelihood of bearing little to nothing every other year).<ref name=\"Alternate Bearing Information\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpes.peachnet.edu/pecan/alternate%20bearing.htm |title=University of Georgia Pecan Breeding |publisher=Cpes.peachnet.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>  The period of pollination groups all cultivars into two families: those that shed pollen before they can receive pollen ([[protandrous]]), and those that shed pollen after becoming receptive to pollen ([[protogynous]]).<ref name=\"GROWING PECANS\">\n\nPecans are also grown in the Central Valley of California\nIN ILLINOIS\">{{cite web|url=http://web.extension.uiuc.edu/edwardsvillecenter/downloads/11263.doc |title=William Reid, Nut Crops Extension Specialist, University of Illinois |date= |accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>  Planting cultivars from both families within 250 feet is recommended for proper pollination.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:pecan-nuts-on-tree.jpg|Ripe pecan nuts on tree\nFile:Carya illinoinensis MHNT.BOT.2011.3.85.jpg|''Carya illinoinensis'', [[MHNT]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Breeding and selection programs ===\nActive breeding and selection programs are carried out by the USDA [[Agricultural Research Service]] with growing locations at [[Brownwood, Texas|Brownwood]] and [[College Station, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://extension-horticulture.tamu.edu/carya/ | publisher=TAMU Horticulture Dept| title=USDA Pecan Breeding Program, National Clonal Germplasm Repository for Pecans and Hickories |accessdate=21 Nov 2014}}</ref> While selection work has been done since the late 1800s, most acreage of pecans grown today is of older cultivars, such as 'Stuart', 'Schley', and 'Desirable', with known flaws but also with known production potential.

Numerous varieties produce well in Texas, but fail in the Southeastern U.S. due to increased disease pressure. Selection programs are ongoing at the state level, with Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Florida, Missouri, and others having trial plantings.\n\nVarieties adapted from the southern tier of states north through some parts of Iowa and even into southern Canada are available from nurseries. Production potential drops significantly when planted further north than Tennessee. Most breeding efforts for northern-adapted varieties have not been on a large enough scale to significantly affect production. Varieties that are available and adapted (e.g., 'Major', 'Martzahn', 'Witte', 'Greenriver', and 'Posey') in [[Hardiness zone|zones 6]] and farther north are almost entirely selections from wild stands. A northern-adapted variety must be grafted onto a northern rootstock to avoid freeze damage.\n\nThe pecan is a 32-chromosome species, and can hybridize with other 32-chromosome members of the ''Carya'' [[genus]], such as ''[[Carya ovata]]'', ''[[Carya laciniosa]]'', and ''[[Carya cordiformis]]''. Most such hybrids are unproductive, though a few second-generation hybrids have potential for producing hickory-flavored nuts with pecan nut structure. Such hybrids are referred to as \"[[hican]]s\" to indicate their hybrid origin.\n\n=== Diseases ===\n{{Main article|List of pecan diseases}}\nIn the Southeastern United States, [[nickel]] deficiency in ''C. illinoinensis'' produces a disorder called mouse-ear in trees fertilized with urea.<ref name=\"BarkerPilbeam2007\">{{cite book|author1=Allen V.

Symptoms of mouse-ear include rounded or blunt leaflet tips which produces smaller leaflets, dwarfing of tree organs, poorly developed root systems, rosetting, delayed bud break, loss of apical dominance, and necrosis of leaflet tips. Mouse-ear can be treated with foliar sprays of nickel. -->  Similarly, zinc deficiency causes rosetting of the leaves.\n\nPecans are also prone to infection by fungi, especially in humid conditions. [[Ziram]] is a common fungicide used to prevent scab and anthracnose in pecans.\n\n== Nutrition ==\n{{Nutritional value\n|name            = Pecans\n|image           = Pecans-4352.jpg\n|caption         =\n|serving_size    = 100 grams\n|kJ              =2889\n|carbs           = 13.86\n|fat             = 71.97\n|protein         = 9.17\n|sugars          = 3.97\n|lactose         =\n|satfat          = 6.18\n|transfat        =\n|monofat         = 40.801\n|polyfat         = 21.614\n|omega3fat       =\n|omega6fat       =\n|fiber           = 9.6\n|starch          = 0.46\n|water           = 3.52\n|alcohol         =\n|caffeine        =\n|opt1n           =\n|opt1v           =\n|opt4n           =\n|opt4v           =\n|calcium_mg      = 70\n|iron_mg         = 2.53\n|phosphorus_mg   = 277\n|magnesium_mg    = 121\n|manganese_mg    = 4.5\n|sodium_mg       = 0\n|potassium_mg    = 410\n|zinc_mg         = 4.53\n|vitA_ug         =\n|vitA_iu         = 56\n|betacarotene_ug = 29\n|lutein_ug       = 17\n|thiamin_mg      = 0.66\n|riboflavin_mg   = 0.13\n|niacin_mg       = 1.167\n|pantothenic_mg  = 0.863\n|vitB6_mg        = 0.21\n|folate_ug       = 22\n|vitB12_ug       =\n|vitC_mg         = 1.1\n|vitD_ug         = 0\n|vitD_iu         =\n|vitE_mg         = 1.4\n|vitK_ug         = 3.5\n|source          =\n|source_usda     = 1\n|note            = [http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3711?fg=&man=&lfacet=&count=&max=35&sort=&qlookup=Nuts%2C+pecans&offset=&format=Full&new=&measureby= Link to Full USDA Database Information]\n}}\n\nIn 100 g, pecans provide 691 [[Calories]]<!-- kilocalories or Calories, NOT calories --> and over 100% of the [[Daily Value]] (DV) for total [[fat]].

Juglandaceae are represented worldwide by between seven and 10 extant genera and more than 60 species. Most of these species are concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere of the New World, but some can be found on every continent except for Antarctica. The first fossil examples of the family appear during the [[Cretaceous]]. Differentiation between the subfamilies of [[Engelhardia | Engelhardioideae]] and Juglandioideae occurred during the early [[Paleogene]], about 64 million years ago. Extant examples of Engelhardioideae are generally tropical and evergreen, while those of Juglandioideae are deciduous and found in more temperate zones. The second major step in the development of WGA11126 pecan was a change from wind-dispersed fruits to animal dispersion. This dispersal strategy coincides with the development of a husk around the fruit and a drastic change in the relative concentrations of fatty acids. The ratio of oleic to linoleic acids are inverted between wind- and animal-dispersed seeds.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2440634 |author=Donald E. Stone|title=New World Juglandaceae. II.

The fruits of the pecan genus ''Carya'' differ from those of the walnut genus ''Juglans'' only in the formation of the husk of the fruit. The husks of walnuts develop from the bracts, bracteoles, and sepals, or sepals only. The husks of pecans develop from the bracts and the bracteoles only.<ref name=\"Paul Manos and Donald E. Stone\" />\n\n== History ==\nBefore European settlement, pecans were widely consumed and traded by Native Americans. As a food source, pecans are a natural choice for preagricultural society. As a wild forage, the fruit of the previous growing season is commonly still edible when found on the ground. Hollow tree trunks, found in abundance in pecan stands, offer ideal storage of pecans by humans and squirrels, alike.<ref name=\"Grant D. Hall\" />\n\nPecans first became known to Europeans in the 16th century. The first Europeans to come into contact with pecans were Spanish explorers in what is now Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana. These Spanish explorers called the pecan, ''nuez de la arruga'', which roughly translates to \"wrinkle nut\". They were called this for their resemblance to wrinkles. The genus ''Carya'' does not exist in the Old World. Because of their familiarity with the genus ''[[Juglans]]'', these early explorers referred to the nuts as ''nogales'' and ''nueces'', the Spanish terms for \"walnut trees\" and \"fruit of the walnut\". They noted the particularly thin shell and acorn-like shape of the fruit, indicating they were indeed referring to pecans.<ref name=\"Grant D. Hall\" /> The Spaniards took the pecan into [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]] beginning in the 16th century. In 1792, [[William Bartram]] reported in his botanical book, ''Travels'', a nut tree, ''Juglans exalata'' that some botanists today argue was the American pecan tree, but others argue was hickory, ''Carya ovata''. Pecan trees are native to the United States, and writing about the pecan tree goes back to the nation's founders. [[Thomas Jefferson]] planted pecan trees, ''C. illinoinensis'' (Illinois nuts), in his nut orchard at his home, Monticello, in Virginia. [[George Washington]] reported in his journal that Thomas Jefferson gave him \"Illinois nuts\", pecans, which Washington then grew at [[Mount Vernon]], his Virginia home.\n\n=== Symbolism ===\nIn 1906, Texas Governor [[James Stephen Hogg]] asked that a pecan tree be planted at his grave instead of a traditional headstone, requesting that the seeds be distributed throughout the state to make Texas a \"Land of Trees\".<ref name=\"Texas Pecan Growers Association\" /> His wish was carried out and this brought more attention to pecan trees. In 1919, the 36th Texas Legislature made the pecan tree the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[Texas]] where the town of [[San Saba, Texas|San Saba]] claims to be \"The Pecan Capital of the World\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sansabatexas.com|title=Town website for San Saba, Texas|publisher=Town of San Saba Texas}}</ref> Several other American towns and regions host annual events celebrating the pecan harvest.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|Carya illinoinensis}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/cail2.htm ''Carya illinoinensis'' images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu]\n* [http://www.uga.edu/nchfp/publications/nchfp/factsheets/preservingpecans.html National Center for Home Food Preservation\u2014Home Preservation of pecans]\n* [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/Spfo/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_2/carya/illinoesis.htm USDA Forest Service: ''Carya illinoensis'']\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/carya-illinoensis-pecan-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map of ''Carya illinoensis'']\n* {{gutenberg|no=28065|name=The Pecan and its Culture}} (Text from 1906)\n* [http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/camden/first-pecan-trees-grown-here-about-1840 First Pecan Trees Grown Here About 1840] historical marker at [[St. Marys, Georgia]]\n\n{{Nuts}}\n\n[[Category:Carya]]\n[[Category:Crops originating from Mexico]]\n[[Category:Crops originating from the United States]]\n[[Category:Cuisine of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Edible nuts and seeds]]\n[[Category:Georgia (U.S. state) culture]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1787]]\n[[Category:Symbols of Texas]]\n[[Category:Trees of Coahuila]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guanajuato]]\n[[Category:Trees of Jalisco]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]\n[[Category:Trees of Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:Trees of Tamaulipas]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Veracruz]]",

Periodic natural wildfire selects for this species by killing other trees, leading to open longleaf pine [[forest]]s or [[Eastern savannas of the United States|savannas]]. New seedlings do not appear at all tree-like and resemble a dark green fountain of needles. This form is called the grass stage. During this stage, which lasts for 5\u201312 years, vertical growth is very slow, and the tree may take a number of years simply to grow ankle-high. After that it makes a growth spurt, especially if there is no [[Canopy (biology)|tree canopy]] above it. In the grass stage, it is very resistant to grass fires, which burn off the ends of the needles, but the fire cannot penetrate the tightly-packed needle bases to reach the bud.  While relatively immune to fire, at this stage, the plant is quite appealing to [[Wild boar#Feral pigs|feral pigs]], and the early settlers' habit of releasing swine into the woodlands to feed was greatly responsible for the decline of the species.\n\nLongleaf pine forests are rich in [[biodiversity]]. They are well-documented for their high levels of plant diversity, in groups including sedges, grasses, carnivorous plants and orchids.<ref>Peet, R. K. and D. J Allard. 1993.

The [[red-cockaded woodpecker]] is dependent on mature pine forests and is now [[conservation status|endangered]] as a result of this decline. Longleaf pine [[seed]]s are large and nutritious, forming a significant food source for [[bird]]s (notably the [[brown-headed nuthatch]]) and other [[wildlife]]. There are 9 [[salamander]] species and 26 [[frog]] species that are characteristic of pine savannas, along with 56 species of [[reptile]]s, 13 of which could be considered specialists on this habitat.<ref>Means, D.

Springer, New York. xii + 438 pp.</ref>\n\nThe [[Red Hills Region]] of Florida and Georgia is home to some of the best preserved stands of longleaf pine. These forests have been burned regularly for many decades to encourage [[bobwhite quail]] habitat in private hunting plantations.\n\n==Uses==\n[[Image:Pinus palustris Pengo.jpg|thumb|''Pinus palustris'']]\nVast forests of longleaf pine once were present along the southeastern [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast and [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf Coast]] of [[North America]], as part of the [[Eastern savannas of the United States|eastern savannas]]. These forests were the source of naval stores - [[resin]], [[turpentine]], and [[timber]] - needed by [[merchant]]s and the [[navy]] for their [[ship]]s. They have been cutover since for timber and usually replaced with faster-growing [[loblolly pine]] and [[Pinus elliottii|slash pine]], for [[agriculture]], and for urban and suburban development. Due to this deforestation and over-harvesting, only about 3% of the original longleaf pine forest remains, and little new is planted. Longleaf pine is available, however, at many nurseries within its range; the southernmost known point of sale is in [[Lake Worth, Florida|Lake Worth]], [[Florida]].\n\nThe yellow, [[resin]]ous [[wood]] is used for [[lumber]] and [[Wood pulp|pulp]]. Boards cut years ago from virgin [[timber]] were very wide, up to {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and a thriving salvage business obtains these boards from demolition projects to be reused as flooring in upscale homes.\n\nThe extremely long needles are popular for use in the ancient craft of coiled basket making.\n\nThe stumps and taproots of old trees become saturated with resin and will not rot. Farmers sometimes find old buried stumps in fields, even in some that were cleared a century ago, and these usually are dug up and sold as [[Fatwood]], \"fat lighter\" or \"lighter wood\" which is in demand as kindling for fireplaces, wood stoves, and barbecue pits. In old growth pine the [[heartwood]] of the [[Trunk (botany)|bole]] is often saturated in the same way. When boards are cut from the fat lighter wood, they are very heavy and will not rot, but buildings constructed of them are quite flammable and make extremely hot fires.\n\nThe longleaf pine is the official [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[Alabama]]<ref>{{Cite web\n| title = Southern Longleaf Pine\n| work = Official Symbols and Emblems of Alabama\n| accessdate = 2009-04-04\n| url = http://www.archives.state.al.us/emblems/st_tree.html\n}}</ref> and although all pines are considered the state tree of [[North Carolina]],<ref>http://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter_145/gs_145-3.html</ref> the longleaf pine is specifically lauded in the official state toast.<ref>North Carolina General Statutes \u00a7 149\u20112 http://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bysection/chapter_149/gs_149-2.html</ref>\n\n==Native range, restoration, and protection==\nBefore European settlement, longleaf pine forest dominated as much as {{convert|90000000|acre|km2}} stretching from [[Virginia]] south to [[Florida]] and west to [[East Texas|eastern Texas]]. Its range was defined by the frequent widespread fires that occurred throughout the southeast. In the late 19th century, these virgin timber stands were \"among the most sought after timber trees in the country.\" This rich ecosystem now has been relegated to less than 5% of its pre-settlement range due to [[clear cutting]] practices:\n\n<blockquote>As they stripped the woods of their trees, loggers left mounds of flammable debris that frequently fueled catastrophic fires, destroying both the remaining trees and seedlings. The exposed earth left behind by clear cutting operations was highly susceptible to erosion, and nutrients were washed from the already porous soils. This further destroyed the natural seeding process. At the peak of the timber cutting in the 1890s and the first decade of the new century, the longleaf pine forests of the Sandhills were providing millions of board feet of timber each year. The timber cutters gradually moved across the South; by the 1920s, most of the \"limitless\" virgin longleaf pine forests were gone.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nIn \"[[pine barrens]]\" most of the day. Low, level, sandy tracts; the pines wide apart; the sunny spaces between full of beautiful abounding grasses, [[liatris]], long, wand-like [[Goldenrod|solidago]], [[Serenoa|saw palmettos]], etc., covering the ground in garden style. Here I sauntered in delightful freedom, meeting none of the cat-clawed vines, or shrubs, of the alluvial bottoms. \u2013 [[John Muir]]\n</blockquote>\n\nEfforts are being made to restore longleaf pine ecosystems within its natural range.

The region is characterized by deep, infertile sands deposited by a prehistoric sea, with generally arid conditions. By the 1930s, most of the native longleaf had been logged, and the land was heavily eroded. Between 1935-1939, the federal government purchased large portions of this area from local landowners as a relief measure under the [[Resettlement Administration]]. These landowners were resettled on more fertile land elsewhere. Today, the South Carolina Sand Hills State Forest comprises approximately half of the acreage, and half is owned by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] as the adjacent [[Carolina Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge]]. At first, restoration of forest cover was the goal. Fire suppression was practiced until the 1960s, when prescribed fire was introduced on both the state forest<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.state.sc.us/forest/refshill.htm}}</ref> and the Sandhills NWR<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/refuge/Carolina_Sandhills/about.html |title=Carolina Sandhills NWR History}}</ref><ref name=\"USFWSburn\">{{cite web |url= http://www.fws.gov/carolinasandhills/pdf/RXBurning2011.pdf |title=Refuge to Begin Conducting Prescribed Burns in February |work=[[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]|accessdate=2011-12-14 }}</ref> as part of the restoration of the longleaf/wiregrass ecosystem.\n\n[[Nokuse Plantation]] is a 53,000 acre private nature preserve located approximately 100 miles east of [[Pensacola, Florida]].

It can be found in two pockets along the St Lawrence River in southern Quebec and Ontario and more prominently occurs from central Maine south to Georgia and as west as Kentucky. It is found in places where other species would find unsuitable for growth such as acidic, sandy, and low nutrient soils. This species occasionally hybridizes with other pine species such as loblolly pine (''[[Pinus taeda]]''), shortleaf pine (''[[Pinus echinata]]''), and pond pine (''[[Pinus serotina]]''); the last is treated as a [[subspecies]] of pitch pine by some [[botanist]]s.\n\n==Distribution==\nPitch pine is found mainly in the southern areas of the [[northeastern United States]], from coastal [[Maine]] and [[Ohio]] to [[Kentucky]] and northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. A few stands occur in southern [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]]. It is known as a pioneer species and is often the first tree to vegetate a site after it has been cleared away. In extreme conditions, it is a climax vegetation type. But in most cases, it is replaced by oaks and other hardwoods. This pine occupies a variety of habitats from dry acidic sandy uplands to swampy lowlands, and can survive in very poor conditions; it is the primary tree of the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|New Jersey Pine Barrens]].<ref name=\"Moore2008\">{{cite book |last=Moore |first=Gerry |last2=Kershner |first2=Bruce |display-authors=2 |first3=Craig |last3=Tufts |first4=Daniel |last4=Mathews |first5=Gil |last5=Nelson |last6=Spellenberg |first6=Richard |last7=Thieret |first7=John W. |first8=Terry |last8=Purinton |last9=Block |first9=Andrew |title=National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Trees of North America |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |year=2008 |page=756 |isbn=1-4027-3875-7}}</ref>\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nScientific name:\u00a0''Pinus rigidia''\u00a0\n\nIt was given its name by British botanist\u00a0[[Philip Miller]]. It belongs to the Pinaceae family and the subgenus Diploxyon along other hard pines\n\n==Description==\nIt is irregular in shape, branches are usually twisted and it does a poor job at self-pruning. The needles are in fascicles of three, about {{convert|6|-|13|cm|abbr=on}} in length, and are stout (over {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on}} broad) and often slightly twisted. The cones are {{convert|4|-|7|cm|abbr=on}} long and oval with prickles on the scales. Trunks are usually straight with a slight curve to them, they are covered in irregular, thick, large plates of bark. Pitch pine has an exceptionally high regenerative ability; if the main trunk is cut or damaged by fire it can re-sprout using [[epicormic shoots]]. This is one of its many adaptations to fire, which also includes a thick bark to protect the sensitive [[Cork cambium|cambium layer]] from heat. Burnt trees often form stunted, twisted trees with multiple trunks as a result of the resprouting. This characteristic also makes it a popular species for [[bonsai]].\n\nPitch pine is rapid-growing when young, gaining around one foot of height per year under optimal conditions until the tree is 50\u201360 years old, whereupon growth slows. By 90 years of age, the amount of annual height gain is minimal. Open-growth trees begin bearing cones in as little as three years, with shade-inhabiting pines taking a few years longer. Cones take two years to mature and seed dispersal occurs over the fall and winter and trees cannot self-pollinate. The total lifespan of pitch pine is about 200 years.\n\n== Role in ecosystem ==\nPitch pine provides a habitat and offers food for many wildlife species. They are used as cover and nesting for birds such as the\u00a0[[Pine warbler]],\u00a0[[Wild turkey]],\u00a0[[red-cockaded woodpecker]],\u00a0[[Great crested flycatcher|great-crested flycatchers]],\u00a0[[blue jay]]s,\u00a0[[black-capped chickadee]]s,\u00a0[[black-and-white warbler]]s,\u00a0[[Nashville warbler|Nashville warblers,]]\u00a0and\u00a0[[chestnut-sided warbler]]s. Deer consume seedlings and new sprouts. and small mammals and birds eat the seeds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us|title=US Forest Service|website=www.fs.fed.us|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nPitch pine is not a major timber tree due to the frequency of multiple or crooked trunks; nor is it as fast-growing as other eastern American pines. However, it grows well on unfavorable sites. In the past, it was a major source of [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and timber for ship building, mine timbers, and railroad ties because the wood's high resin content preserves it from decay. Pitch pine wood was also used for building radio towers in Germany, as at [[transmitter Muehlacker|Muehlacker]] and [[transmitter Ismaning|Ismaning]].\n\nPitch pine is currently used mainly for rough construction, pulp, crating, and fuel. However, due to its uneven growth, quantities of high quality can be very sought after, and large lengths of pitch pine can be very costly.\n\nAcheology indicates that the\u00a0[[Iroquois]],\u00a0[[Shinnecock Indian Nation|Shinnecock]], and\u00a0[[Cherokee]]\u00a0all utilized pitch pine. The Iroquois used the pitch to treat rheumatism, burns, cuts, and boils. Pitch also worked as a laxative. A pitch pine poultice was used by both the Iroquois and the Shinnecock to open boils and to treat abscesses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treesforme.com.|title=North American Native Trees|website=www.treesforme.com.|access-date=2017-05-01}}</ref> The Cherokee used pitch pine wood in canoe construction and for decorative carvings.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:2013-05-10 09 02 57 Pitch Pine new growth and pollen cones along the Batona Trail in Brendan T.

It provides food and shelter for numerous forest birds, such as the [[red crossbill]], and small mammals such as [[squirrel]]s.\n\nEastern White Pine forests originally covered much of north-central and north-eastern North America. Only one percent of the [[old-growth forest]]s remain after the extensive logging operations of the 18th century to early 20th century.\n\nOld growth forests, or virgin stands, are protected in [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. Other protected areas with known virgin forests, as confirmed by the Eastern Native Tree Society, include [[Algonquin Provincial Park]], [[Quetico Provincial Park]], and Algoma Highlands in [[Ontario]], Canada; [[Estivant Pines]], [[Huron Mountains]], [[Porcupine Mountains]] State Park, and [[Sylvania Wilderness|Sylvania Wilderness Area]] in the [[Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]], United States; [[Hartwick Pines State Park]] in the [[Lower Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]]; [[Menominee Indian Reservation]] in [[Wisconsin]]; Lost 40 Scientific and Natural Area (SNA) and [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness]] in [[Minnesota]]; [[White Pines State Park]], [[Illinois]]; [[Cook Forest State Park]], [[Hearts Content Scenic Area]], and [[Anders Run Natural Area]] in [[Pennsylvania]]; and the [[Linville Gorge Wilderness]] in [[North Carolina]].\n\nSmall [[Grove (nature)|groves]] or individual specimens of old growth Eastern White Pines are found across the range of the species in the USA, including in Ordway Pines, [[Maine]]; Ice Glen, [[Massachusetts]]; and [[Adirondack Park]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Many sites with conspicuously large specimens represent advanced [[Old field (ecology)|old field]] [[ecological succession]]. The tall stands in [[Mohawk Trail State Forest]] and [[William Cullen Bryant Homestead]] in [[Massachusetts]] are examples.\n\nAs an [[introduced species]], ''Pinus strobus'' is now [[naturalization (biology)|naturalizing]] in the [[Divisions of the Carpathians#Outer Eastern Carpathians|Outer Eastern Carpathians]] subdivision of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in [[Czech Republic]] and southern Poland. It has spread from specimens planted as [[ornamental tree]]s.\n\n== Description ==\nLike all members of the [[Pinus classification#Subgenus Strobus|white pine group]], ''[[Pinus]]'' subgenus ''[[Strobus]]'', the [[leaf|leaves]] (\"needles\") are in fascicles (bundles) of 5, or rarely 3 or 4, with a [[deciduous]] sheath. They are flexible, bluish-green, finely serrated, {{convert|5|-|13|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long, and persist for 18 months, i.e., from the spring of one season until autumn of the next, when they [[abscission|abscise]].\n\nThe [[conifer cone|cones]] are slender, {{convert|8|-|16|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long (rarely longer than that) and {{convert|4|-|5|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad when open, and have scales with a rounded apex and slightly reflexed tip. The [[seed]]s are {{convert|4|-|5|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long, with a slender {{convert|15|-|20|mm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} wing, and are dispersed by wind. Cone production peaks every 3 to 5&nbsp;years.\n\nWhile Eastern White Pine is self-fertile, seeds produced this way tend to result in weak, stunted, and malformed seedlings.\n\nMature trees are often 200\u2013250 years old, and some live to over 400 years. A tree growing near [[Syracuse, New York]] was dated to 458 years old in the late 1980s and trees in [[Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin]] were dated to approximately 500 years old.\n\n{{Gallery\n|File:Pinus strobus needles3.jpg|foliage\n|File:Pinus strobus Cone.jpg|cone\n|File:Eastern White Pine Pinus strobus Bark Vertical.JPG|bark\n|File:Malecones.jpg|male cones\n}}\n\n=== Dimensions ===\n[[File:Pinus strobus JPG1b.jpg|thumb|right|Measuring the circumference of an Eastern White Pine]]\n\nThe Eastern White Pine has the distinction of being the tallest [[tree]] in eastern [[North America]]. In natural pre-[[Colonial America|colonial]] stands it is reported to have grown as tall as {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}}. There is no means of accurately documenting the height of trees from these times, but Eastern White Pine may have reached this height on rare occasions. Even greater heights have been reported in popular, but unverifiable, accounts such as Robert Pike's \"Tall Trees, Tough Men\".\n\nTotal trunk volumes of the largest specimens are approximately {{convert|28|m3|abbr=on}}, with some past giants possibly reaching {{convert|37|or|40|m3|abbr=on}}. Photographic analysis of giants suggests volumes closer to {{convert|34|m3|abbr=on}}.\n\n==== Height ====\n''Pinus strobus'' grows approximately {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} annually between the ages of 15 and 45 years, with slower height increments before and after that age range.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Beck, D.E. |year=1971 |title=Height-Growth Patterns and Site Index of White Pine in the Southern Appalachians |journal=Forest Science |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=252\u2013260 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/saf/fs/1971/00000017/00000002/art00024}}</ref> The tallest presently living specimens are {{convert|50|\u2013|57.55|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, as determined by the [[Native Tree Society]] (NTS).<ref>[http://www.nativetreesociety.org/ NTS\u2014Native Tree Society]</ref> Three locations in [[southeastern United States]] and one site in [[northeastern United States]] have trees that are {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.\n\nThe southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] have the most locations and the tallest trees in the present range of ''Pinus strobus''. One survivor is a specimen known as the \"Boogerman Pine\" in the [[Cataloochee (Great Smoky Mountains)|Cataloochee Valley]] of [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. At {{convert|57.55|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, it is the tallest accurately measured tree in North America east of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It has been climbed and measured by tape drop by the Native Tree Society. Before [[Hurricane Opal]] broke its top in October 1995, Boogerman Pine was {{convert|63|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, as determined by Will Blozan and Robert Leverett using ground based measurements.\n\nThe tallest specimens in [[Hartwick Pines State Park]] in [[Michigan]] are {{convert|45|\u2013|48|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.\n\nIn northeastern USA, 8 sites in 4 states currently have trees over {{convert|48|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, as confirmed by the Native Tree Society. The [[Cook Forest State Park]] of [[Pennsylvania]] has the most numerous collection of {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} Eastern White Pines in the Northeast, with 110 trees measuring that height or more. The Park's \"Longfellow Pine\" is the tallest presently living Eastern White Pine in the Northeast, at {{convert|55.96|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, as determined by being climbed and measured by tape drop.<ref>Luthringer, D.J. 2009.

In pure stands mature trees usually have no branches on the lower half of the trunk. The [[white pine weevil]] (''[[White pine weevil|Pissodes strobi]]'') and [[Cronartium ribicola|white pine blister rust]] (''Cronartium ribicola''), an introduced fungus, can damage or kill these trees.\n\n=== Blister rust ===\nMortality from white pine blister rust in mature pine groves was often 50\u201380% during the early 20th century. The fungus must spend part of its life cycle on alternate hosts of the ''[[Ribes]]'' genus, the native gooseberry or wild currant. Foresters proposed that if all the alternate host plants were removed that white pine blister rust might be eliminated. A very determined campaign was mounted and all land owners in commercial pine growing regions were encouraged to uproot and kill all native gooseberry and wild currant plants.<ref name=ling /><ref name=lombard>Lombard K. and J. Bofinger. 1999. White Pine Blister Rust. NH Div. of Forests and Lands.</ref> The ramifications for wildlife and [[habitat]] ecology were of less concern at the time than timber industry protection.\n\nToday native wild currants are relatively rare plants in New England, and planting wild currants or wild gooseberries is strongly discouraged, or even illegal in some jurisdictions. As an alternative, new strains of commercial currants have been developed which are highly resistant to white pine blister rust. Mortality in white pines from rust is only about 3% today.<ref name=lombard />\n\n== Historical uses ==\n\n=== Lumber ===\nIn the 19th century, the harvesting of [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] white pine forests played a major role in America's [[Territorial evolution of the United States|westward expansion]] through the [[Great Plains]]. A quarter million white pines were harvested and sent to lumber yards in [[Chicago]] in a single year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cronon|first=William|title=Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West|year=1991|publisher=W.

Of light weight, it has borne transportation to the farms of the west, where it is used for building purposes in dwellings, barns and corn cribs, while as a fencing material it has no superior. Aside from those conditions which demand a dense strong timber, such as ship-building or in wagon-making, white pine has been found adaptable to all the economic uses in which lumber is required, not excluding its use in coarser articles of furniture. No wood has found greater favor or entered more fully into supplying all those wants of man which could be found in the forest growths.<ref name=\"Hotchkiss 1861 752\" />\n|qalign = left\n|align = center\n|width = 65%\n}}\n\nThe species was imported in 1620 to England by Captain [[George Weymouth]], who planted it for a timber crop, but had little success because of white pine blister rust disease.\n\nOld growth pine in the Americas, of various ''Pinus'' species, was a highly desired wood since huge, knot-free boards were the rule rather than the exception. Pine was common and easy to cut, thus many colonial homes used pine for paneling, floors and furniture. Pine was also a favorite tree of loggers since pine logs can still be processed in a lumber mill a year or more after being cut down. In contrast, most hardwood trees such as cherry, maple, oak, and ash must be cut into 1\u201d thick boards immediately after felling or large cracks will develop in the trunk which can render the wood worthless.<ref name=ling />\n\nAlthough eastern white pine was frequently used for flooring in buildings constructed before the [[U.S. Civil War]], the wood is soft and will tend to cup over time with wear.  [[George Washington]] opted for the much harder [[southern yellow pine]] at Mount Vernon instead.<ref name=ling />\n\n=== Masts ===\nDuring the age of [[square rigger]]s, tall white pines with high quality wood in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] were known as ''[[mast (sailing)|mast]] pines''. Marked by agents of [[the Crown]] with the [[Broad arrow#Use in the American colonies|broad arrow]], these \"mast pines\" were reserved for the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]].\n\nSpecial barge-like vessels were built to ship up to 50 pine trunks destined to become masts.<!-- Ship from where to where? Oceangoing barges? --> The wood was often squared immediately after felling to fit in the holds of ships better.<ref name=ling /> A {{convert|100|ft|m|disp=flip|abbr=on}} mast was about {{convert|3|x|3|ft|cm|disp=flip|abbr=on}} at the butt and {{convert|2|x|2|ft|cm|disp=flip|abbr=on}} at the top, while a {{convert|120|ft|m|disp=flip|abbr=on}} mast was {{convert|4|x|4|ft|m|disp=flip|abbr=on}} by {{convert|30|in|cm|disp=flip|abbr=on}} on its ends.\n\nMarking of large specimens by the Crown was very controversial in the colonies, leading to the [[Pine Tree Riot]] in 1772; its act of rebellion played a significant role in the events leading to the [[American Revolution]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}  During that conflict colonists cut down and hauled off many mast pines.<ref name=nizalowski>Nizalowski, E. 1997.

An unusual large, lone, white pine was found in colonial times in coastal [[South Carolina]] along the [[Black River (South Carolina)|Black River]], far east of its southernmost normal range. The king's mark was carved into it, giving rise to the town of [[Kingstree, South Carolina|Kingstree]].<ref name=\"Williamsburg Hometown Chamber\">{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.williamsburgsc.org/history.htm|accessdate=November 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Contemporary uses ==\n\n=== Lumber ===\n[[File:PinusStrobusBoard.jpg|thumb|Board of ''Pinus strobus'']]\n\nEastern white pine is now widely grown in [[plantation]] [[forestry]] within its native area.\n\nFreshly cut eastern white pine is creamy white or a pale straw color but pine wood which has aged many years tends to darken to a deep rich golden tan. Occasionally one can find light brown pine boards with unusual yellowish-golden or reddish-brown hues. This is the famous \"pumpkin pine\". It is generally thought that slow growing pines in old-growth forests accumulate colored products in the heartwood, but genetic factors and soil conditions may also play a role in rich color development.<ref name=nizalowski />\n\nThis wood is also favored by pattern makers for its easy working.\n\n=== Foods and medicines ===\nEastern white pine needles contain five times the amount of [[Vitamin C]] (by weight) of [[lemon]]s{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} and make an excellent [[herbal tea]]. The [[Vascular cambium|cambium]] is edible. It is also a source of [[resveratrol]]. [[Linnaeus]] noted in the 18th century that cattle and pigs fed pine [[bark bread]] grew well, but he personally did not like the taste. Caterpillars of Lusk's Pinemoth (''[[Coloradia]] luski'') have been found to feed only on ''Pinus strobus''.\n\nPine tar is produced by slowly burning pine roots, branches, or small trunks in a partially smothered flame. Pine tar mixed with beer can be used to remove [[tapeworm]]s (flat worms) or [[nematode]]s (round worms). Pine tar mixed with sulfur is useful to treat dandruff, and marketed in present-day products. Pine tar can also be processed to make [[turpentine]].<ref>Erichsen-Brown, C. 1979. Medicinal and Other Uses of North American Plants.

The [[Chippewa]] also used pine resin to successfully treat infections and even gangrenous wounds.<ref name=umich /> This is because pine resin apparently has a number of quite efficient antimicrobials. Generally a wet pulp from the inner bark, or pine tar mixed with beeswax or butter was applied to wounds and used as a salve to prevent infection.\n\n=== Cultivation ===\n''Pinus strobus'' is cultivated by [[plant nursery|plant nurseries]] as an [[ornamental tree]], for planting in gardens and parks.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=PIST from Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center Native Plant Information Network (NPIN)]; species account, horticultural information, + photographs . accessed 1.13.2013</ref> The species is low-maintenance and rapid growing as a specimen tree.

Eastern white pines are noted for holding their needles well, even long after being harvested. They also are well suited for people with allergies, as they give little to no aroma. A standard {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on|disp=flip|sp=us}} tree takes approximately 6 to 8 years to grow in ideal conditions. Sheared varieties are usually desired because of their stereotypical [[Christmas tree]] conical shape, as naturally grown ones can become too thick for larger ornaments, or grow bushy in texture.<ref>[http://www.christmastree.org/trees/e_wht_pn.cfm Christmas tree.org]</ref> The branches of the eastern white pine are also widely used in making holiday wreaths and garland because of their soft, feathery needles.\n\n== Symbolism ==\nEastern White Pine is the [[Provincial tree emblems of Canada|Provincial Tree]] of [[Ontario]], Canada.<ref>[http://www.sd71.bc.ca/Sd71/Edulinks/Canada/Ontindex.htm Ontario Symbols].

Hence the pine is named as it is generally (but not exclusively) found in lowlands and swampy areas.<ref name=freedictionary/> Loblolly pines grow well in acidic clay soil, which is common throughout the South, and are thus often found in large stands in rural places. Other old names, now rarely used, include oldfield pine, due to its status as an [[Ruderal species|early colonizer]] of abandoned fields; bull pine, due to its size (several other [[Pinus classification#Subgenus Pinus - yellow or hard pines|yellow pines]] are also often so named, especially large isolated specimens); rosemary pine, due to loblolly's distinctive fragrance compared to the other southern pines; and North Carolina pine.<ref name=\"Moore2008\">{{cite book |author1=Moore, Gerry |author2=Kershner, Bruce |author3=Craig Tufts |author4=Daniel Mathews |author5=Gil Nelson |author6=Spellenberg, Richard |author7=Thieret, John W. |author8=Terry Purinton |author9=Block, Andrew |title=National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Trees of North America |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |year=2008 |page=73 |isbn=1-4027-3875-7}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[scientific name]], ''[[wikt:Pinus|Pinus]]''  is the Latin name for the pines and ''[[wikt:taeda|taeda]]''  refers to the resinous wood.<ref>[http://www.biosurvey.ou.edu/shrub/pita.htm Oklahoma Biological Survey: ''Pinus taeda'' L.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Tree Types and Barks 004.jpg|left|thumb|Bark on a mature tree]]\n\n== Ecology ==\nWith the advent of [[wildfire suppression]], loblolly pine has come to prevalence in some parts of the deep south that were once dominated by longleaf pine and, especially in northern [[Florida]], [[Pinus elliottii|slash pine]].<ref>Richardson, D.

The usual size range for this [[pine]] is 9\u201318&nbsp;m, but can grow taller under optimum conditions. The trunk can be as large as 0.5&nbsp;m diameter. This tree prefers well-drained [[loam]] or clay, but will also grow on very poor, sandy soil, where it remains small and stunted. The typical life span is 65 to 90 years.\n\nThe short (4\u20138&nbsp;cm), yellow-green needles are paired in [[Fascicle (botany)|fascicles]] and are often twisted. [[Pinecone]]s are 4\u20137&nbsp;cm long and may persist on the tree for many years, often (though not always) releasing their seeds in the second year. In growth habit, some trees may be inclined with twisted trunks.\n\nThis pine is useful for [[reforesting]] and provides nourishment for wildlife. Its other main use is on [[Christmas tree farm]]s, despite having sharp-tipped [[Pine needle|needles]] and yellowish winter color. It also can provide [[wood pulp]] and [[lumber]].

Gymnosperms produce seeds, but they do not protect these seeds with an ovary or with fruit and they lack flowers.\n\n== Description ==\n''Pinus virginiana'' is a distinct pine in the United States and can be identified by a key characteristic the relatively short needles are twisted and come in bunches of two. The needles are typically are two to eight centimeters in length. There is hair on the bracts and on the bud scales of the ''P. virginiana''. The leaf sheath of the ''P. virginiana'' is greater than 2.5 millimeters long. The cones of the ''P. virginiana'' only open after they are mature. The branches of the ''Pinus virginiana'' are flexible.

The oldest recorded was 150 years old.<ref name=\":3\"/>\n\n== Ethnobotany ==\nCherokee Indians used ''P. virginiana'' medicinally. They used it for many symptoms like diarrhea, stiffness of the body, colds, fevers, hemorrhoids, tuberculosis, and constipation. Cherokee Indians used ''P. virginiana'' in different ways including bathing in water that had been soaked in the bark, steams and oils, root and needle infusions, and for tar. They also used it in certain cultural rituals. In burial rituals ''P. virginiana'' branches were burned and the ashes were used for a fire in their homes. Also, they would infuse needles in apple juice and they would drink it. The Cherokee basically did that as a toast to the wind. Lastly, they used the root infusions as a stimulant and the needles were used as a soap.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe etymology of the ''Pinus virginiana'' is as follows: ''Pinus'' is Latin for Pine and ''virginiana'' means of Virginia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schoennagel |first1=Tania |last2=Veblen |first2=Thomas T. |last3=Romme |first3=William H. |date=July 2004 |title=The Interaction of Fire, Fuels, and Climate across Rocky Mountain Forests |journal=BioScience|volume=54 |issue=7 |pages=661\u2013676 |issn=0006-3568 |url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~schoenna/images/Schoennagel2004BioScience.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n''Pinus virginiana'' was used historically as mine timbers, for railroad ties, and for fuel and tar.

It is usually called [[sycamore]] in North America, a name which can refer to other types of [[tree]] in other parts of the world.  The name is derived from the Greek word \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (''platanos''), meaning flat, and the Latin word occidentalis meaning \"of the west\", and \"sycamore\" is derived from the ancient Greek \u03c3\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''s\u016bkomoros'') meaning \"fig-mulberry\".\n\n==Description==\nAn American sycamore tree can often be easily distinguished from other trees by its mottled exfoliating bark which flakes off in great irregular masses, leaving the surface mottled, and greenish-white, gray and brown. The bark of all trees has to yield to a growing trunk by stretching, splitting, or infilling; the sycamore shows the process more openly than many other trees. The explanation is found in the rigid texture of the bark tissue which lacks the elasticity of the bark of some other trees, so it is incapable of stretching to accommodate the growth of the wood underneath, so the tree sloughs it off.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book |last=Keeler |first=Harriet L. |title=Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |year=1900 |location =New York |pages=263\u2013268}}</ref>\n\nA sycamore can grow to massive proportions, typically reaching up to {{convert|30|to|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|1.5|to|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter when grown in deep soils. The largest of the species have been measured to {{convert|51|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and nearly {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter. Larger specimens were recorded in historical times. In 1744, a Shenandoah Valley settler named Joseph Hampton and two sons lived for most of the year in a hollow sycamore in what is now Clarke County, Virginia.<ref>{{Cite book|title = A History of the Valley of Virginia|last = Kercheval|first = Samuel|publisher = Samuel H.

Spreading limbs at the top make an irregular, open head. Roots are fibrous. The trunks of large trees are often hollow.\n\nAnother peculiarity is the way the leaves grow sticky, green buds. In early August, most trees in general will have&mdash;nestled in the axils of their leaves&mdash;the tiny forming bud which will produce the leaves of the coming year. The sycamore branch apparently has no such buds. Instead there is an enlargement of the petiole which encloses the bud in a tight-fitting case at the base of the petiole.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n* Bark: Dark reddish brown, broken into oblong plate-like scales; higher on the tree, it is smooth and light gray; separates freely into thin plates which peel off and leave the surface pale yellow, or white, or greenish. Branchlets at first pale green, coated with thick pale tomentum, later dark green and smooth, finally become light gray or light reddish brown.\n* Wood: Light brown, tinged with red; heavy, weak, difficult to split. Largely used for furniture and interior finish of houses, butcher's blocks. [[Specific gravity]], 0.5678; [[relative density]], {{convert|33.539|lb/ft3|disp=flip|abbr=on}}.\n* Winter buds: Large, stinky, sticky, green, and three-scaled, they form in summer within the petiole of the full grown leaf. The inner scales enlarge with the growing shake. There is no terminal bud.\n* Leaves: Alternate, palmately nerved, broadly ovate or orbicular, {{convert|4|to|9|in|cm|disp=flip|abbr=on}} inches long, truncate or cordate or wedge-shaped at base, decurrent on the petiole. Three to five-lobed by broad shallow sinuses rounded in the bottom; lobes acuminate, toothed, or entire, or undulate. They come out of the bud plicate, pale green coated with pale tomentum; when full grown are bright yellow green above, paler beneath. In autumn they turn brown and wither before falling. Petioles long, abruptly enlarged at base and inclosing the buds. Stipules with spreading, toothed borders, conspicuous on young shoots, caducous.\n* Flowers: May, with the leaves; monoecious, borne in dense heads. Staminate and pistillate heads on separate peduncles. Staminate heads dark red, on axillary peduncles; pistillate heads light green tinged with red, on longer terminal peduncles. Calyx of staminate flowers three to six tiny scale-like sepals, slightly united at the base, half as long as the pointed petals. Of pistillate flowers three to six, usually four, rounded sepals, much shorter than the acute petals. Corolla of three to six thin scale-like petals.\n* Stamens: In staminate flowers as many of the divisions of the calyx and opposite to them; filaments short; anthers elongated, two-celled; cells opening by lateral slits; connectives hairy.\n* Pistil: Ovary superior, one-celled, sessile, ovate-oblong, surrounded at base by long, jointed, pale hairs; styles long, incurved, red, stigmatic, ovules one or two.\n* Fruit: Brown heads, solitary or rarely clustered, {{convert|1|in|cm|disp=flip|abbr=on}} in diameter, hanging on slender stems three to six inches long; persistent through the winter.

''Gnomonia platani''), an introduced fungus found naturally on the [[Platanus orientalis|Oriental plane]] ''P. orientalis'', which has evolved considerable resistance to the disease. Although rarely killed or even seriously harmed, American sycamore is commonly partially [[Defoliation|defoliated]] by the disease, rendering it unsightly as a specimen tree.\n\nSometimes mistaken for frost damage, the disease manifests in early spring, wilting new leaves and causing mature leaves to turn brown along the veins.  Infected leaves typically shrivel and fall, so that by summer the tree is regrowing its foliage.  Cankers form on twigs and branches near infected leaves, serving to spread the disease by spore production and also weakening the tree. Because cankers restrict the flow of nutrients, twigs and branches afflicted by cankers eventually die.  [[Witch's broom]] is a symptom reflecting the cycle of twigs dying.<ref>{{cite web|last=Swift|first=C.E.|title=Sycamore Anthracnose|url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/02930.html|publisher=Colorado State University Extension|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the fungus' damage, American sycamore is often avoided as a landscape tree, and the more resistant [[London plane]] (''P. \u00d7 hispanica''; hybrid ''P. occidentalis \u00d7 P. orientalis'') is planted instead.\n\n==History==\n\nThe terms under which the [[New York Stock Exchange]] was formed are called the \"[[Buttonwood Agreement]],\" because it was signed under a buttonwood (sycamore) tree at 68 [[Wall Street]], [[New York City]] in 1792.\n\nThe sycamore made up a large part of the forests of Greenland and Arctic America during the [[Cretaceous]] and [[Tertiary period]]s.

Leaves are similar to ''[[Populus tremuloides]]'', but slightly larger and having larger teeth.<ref>{{cite book |title=Trees and Shrubs of Minnesota: the Complete Guide to Species Identification |first=Welby R. |last=Smith |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |date=2008 }}</ref>  The leaves tremble in the wind as ''P. tremuloides'' does.  Bark of younger trees is olive-green, thin and smooth; after 30\u201340 years, the bark is grey, thick and rough with grooves.\n\n== Reproduction ==\nBigtooth aspens produce seeds from the flower clusters, known as [[catkin]]s. The seed, a two-valved capsule, is distributed widely by the wind. Individuals can also reproduce through the roots after a disturbance event, such as fire or harvest; the roots of the dead/cut tree will begin to send up suckers, creating identical individuals, and can result in a stand of clones that resemble that individual.<ref name=\"rook.org\">http://www.rook.org/earl/bwca/nature/trees/populusgrand.html</ref>\n\n== Growth ==\nBigtooth aspens are [[dioecious]], medium-sized deciduous trees with straight trunks and gently ascending branches. Heights at maturity are around {{convert|60|\u2013|80|ft|m}} with diameters of {{convert|8|\u2013|10|in|cm}}. They are fast growing and are relatively short-lived; stands will begin to deteriorate after 60\u201370 years, while individuals can live up to 100 years. They often constitute early successional species of their landscapes.  Roots are shallow and wide spreading; lateral root growth in a forest may be as far as {{convert|60|ft}}.<ref name=\"rook.org\" /> Generally, four to five lateral roots originate from the tree, and then branch within {{convert|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}}; vertical, penetrating roots near the base anchor the tree.\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe range of ''Populus grandidentata'' extends from Virginia north to Maine and Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia; west to southeastern Manitoba and Minnesota; south through Iowa to extreme northeastern Missouri; and east through Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and West Virginia.  Disjunct populations are found in Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina.<ref>http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/popgra/all.html</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe species is able to adapt to a wide range of soils, though it is most abundant on sands, loamy sands and light sandy loams.  Big-tooth aspens can tolerate sandy uplands and high, rocky sites. The depth to the water table is generally about {{convert|5|ft}}.<ref>{{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Populus |species=grandidentata |first=Paul R. |last=Laidly}}</ref> Soil must be moist but well-aerated for good growth. Being very shade intolerant, most shaded stems die. They are pioneer species on disturbed sites, persisting in successional communities until senescence. Rapid height growth of suckers allows it to outcompete other sprouting species such as [[red oak]] (''Quercus rubra'') and [[red maple]] (''Acer rubrum'') on many sites. In the absence of disturbance, it is soon replaced by conifers and hardwoods. In the Great Lakes Region at the turn of the 20th century, many mature pine forests were logged and burned. Bigtooth and quaking aspens frequently dominated the postdisturbance forests. Without fire or other disturbance, these forests are being replaced by later successional, shade-tolerant species. This aspen usually grows in even-aged, mixed stands, most commonly with quaking aspens. Codominant in both hardwood and conifer forests, it does not occur as a subdominant because of its extreme shade intolerance. [[Quaking aspen]] (''Populus tremuloides'') is the predominant species in aspen stands in the Great Lakes region, but bigtooth aspen dominates on drier, upland sites. Aspen stands dominated by bigtooth aspens are generally more open than those dominated by quaking aspens. It is more disease resistant than ''P. tremuloides''. The most serious disease is hypoxylon canker (caused by ''[[Entoleuca mammata]]''). Other rots, fungi, and root decay affect this species. A preferred host of [[gypsy moth]], death occurs when nearly complete defoliation by gypsy moths is followed by a fungal infection by ''[[Armillaria]]'' spp. The ambrosia beetle (''[[Xyleborus saxesceni]]'') attacks fire-damaged bigtooth aspens. Commonly, it occurs in areas that frequently burn, such as large upland areas distant from water and upwind of natural fire breaks, such as lakes.\n\n== Uses ==\nThe wood is light-colored, straight-grained, fine-textured, and soft. It is used primarily for pulp, but can be used to make particle board and structural panels. Minor uses include log homes, pallets, boxes, match splints, chopsticks, hockey stick components, and ladders.  The bark is pelletized for fuel and supplemental cattle feed.\n\n== References ==\n{{USGovernment|sourceUrl=https://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/silvics_manual/Volume_2/populus/grandidentata.htm}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{PLANTS|symbol=POGR4|name=Populus grandidentata}}\n* [http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Populus+grandidentata University of Michigan at Dearborn: Native American Ethnobotany of ''Populus grandidentata'']\n\n[[Category:Populus|grandidentata]]\n[[Category:Flora of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Trees of temperate climates]]\n[[Category:Plants used in traditional Native American medicine]]",

Leaves are 2\" to 5\" in length, ovate-lanceolate in shape, with finely toothed margins. Fall leaf color is yellow to red. Flowers are small, white and 5-petalled, in racemes 4\" to 6\" long which contain several dozen flowers. The flowers give rise to edible reddish-black \"berries\" ([[drupes]]).<ref name=\"NCCE\"/>\n\nA mature black cherry tree can easily be identified in a forest by its very broken, dark grey to black bark, which has the appearance of very thick, burnt cornflakes. However, for about the first decade or so of its life, the bark is thin, smooth, and banded, resembling that of a [[birch]]. It can also quickly be identified by its long, shiny leaves resembling those of a [[sourwood]], and by an almond-like odor released when a young twig is scratched and held close to the nose.<ref>This odor is the result of minute amounts of [[cyanide]] compounds produced and stored by the plant as a defense mechanism against [[herbivore]]s.

In the [[Midwest]], it is seen growing mostly in old fields with other sunlight-loving species, such as [[black walnut]], [[black locust]], and [[Celtis|hackberry]]. Gleason and Cronquist (1991) describe ''P. serotina'' as \"[f]ormerly a forest tree, now abundant as a weed-tree of roadsides, waste land, and forest-margins.\"<ref>Gleason, Henry A. and Arthur Cronquist.  1991.  \"Manual of Vascular Plants of Northeastern United States and Adjacent Canada, Second Edition.\"  The New York Botanical Garden.  Bronx, New York.  910 pp.</ref> It is a moderately long-lived tree, with ages of up to 258 years known, though it is prone to storm damage, with branches breaking easily; any decay resulting, however, only progresses slowly. Seed production begins around 10 years of age, but does not become heavy until 30 years and continues up to 100 years or more. Germination rates are high, and the seeds are widely dispersed by birds who eat the fruit and then excrete them. Some seeds however may remain in the [[Soil seed bank|soil bank]] and not germinate for as long as three years. All ''Prunus'' species have hard seeds that benefit from [[Scarification (botany)|scarification]] to germinate (which in nature is produced by passing through an animal's digestive tract).\n\n[[File:2014-11-02 11 47 15 Black Cherry foliage during autumn along Upper Ferry Road in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|thumb|right|Autumn foliage]]\n''P.&nbsp;serotina'' is also a host of [[caterpillar]]s of various [[Lepidoptera]] (see [[List of Lepidoptera which feed on Prunus|List of Lepidoptera which feed on ''Prunus'']]).

Removal is not always practical, though, because they often grow in very large numbers on farms, taking advantage of the light brought about by mowing and grazing. Entire fencerows can be lined with this poisonous tree, making it difficult to monitor all the branches falling into the grazing area. Black cherry is a leading cause of livestock illness, and grazing animals' access to it should be limited.\n\n== Uses ==\nThe fruit of  ''Prunus serotina'' is suitable for making [[jam]] and [[pie|cherry pies]],<ref>[http://www.cooks.com/rec/search/0,1-0,black_cherry_pie,FF.html Cooking, Recipes, and More.

The black cherry is commonly used instead of sweet cherries (''[[Prunus avium]]'') to achieve a sharper taste. It is also used in cakes which include dark chocolate, such as a [[Black Forest gateau]] and as garnishes for [[cocktail]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nThe wood of  ''Prunus&nbsp;serotina'' is also used for cooking and [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]] foods, where it imparts a unique flavor.\n\n''Prunus&nbsp;serotina'' [[timber]] is valuable; perhaps the premier [[cabinet (furniture)|cabinetry]] timber of the U.S., traded as \"cherry\".

Despite their bitter kernel, they are eaten by deer, squirrels and birds. Acorn production is often heavy, enhancing the species' value for wildlife.<ref name=jacqui/>\n\nThe seedlings show embryo [[dormancy]] and [[germinate]] the following spring after fall ripening; germination is [[hypogeal germination|hypogeal]].\n\nSwamp laurel oak grows rapidly and usually matures in about 50 years which has led to its wide use as an ornamental.

This conclusion was based on an index from leaf-shape on seedlings grown from acorns. However, this theory has not achieved wide support, with current authors accepting ''Quercus laurifolia'' as a distinct species ''(e.g. [[Flora of North America]]).''<ref name=jacqui>[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233501055 Flora of North America: ''Quercus laurifolia'' Swamp Laurel Oak]</ref>\n\nKnown hybrids with ''Quercus laurifolia'' as one parent are with ''Q. falcata'' (''Q \u00d7 beaumontiana'' Sarg.), ''Q. incana'' (''Q. \u00d7 atlantica'' Ashe), and ''Q. marilandica'' (''Q. \u00d7 diversiloba'' Tharp ex A. Camus).\n\n==Soils and climate==\nSwamp laurel oak is found mostly on [[alluvial]] [[flood plain]]s, from sea level up to {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} altitude. It will tolerate the wetter sites in association with other oak species but will not live with continuous or prolonged [[flood]]ing. It is most often found growing in sandy soil near [[river]]s and along the edges of [[swamp]]s if not too frequently flooded. Swamp laurel oak grows in the [[hammock (ecology)|hammocks]] of central Florida and on sand hills adjacent to swamps in west Florida. Swamp laurel oak grows best on [[ultisol]]s and [[inceptisol]]s.\n\nThe range has average annual temperatures from {{convert|16|to|21|C|F}}. It can withstand extreme lows ranging from {{convert|-1|to|-18|C|F}}. Extreme highs range from {{convert|38|to|43|C|F}}.\n\nIt needs between {{convert|1250|-|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall a year. From {{convert|500|-|1000|mm|in|abbr=on}} of this is received during the growing season from April to September.\n\n==Uses==\nIt is grown and marketed mainly as [[pulpwood]]. It is commonly used as an [[ornamental tree]] in landscaping because of its fast growth and pleasing appearance; it is planted with little regard to soil type. The acorns provide food for [[raccoon]]s, [[white-tailed deer]], [[wild turkey]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[duck]]s, [[bobwhite quail]], and small [[bird]]s and [[rodent]]s.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Quercus laurifolia}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060910154901/http://www.sfws.auburn.edu/samuelson/dendrology/fagaceae_pg/swmp_laural_oak.html Trees of Alabama and the Southeast: Swamp Laurel Oak]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041211140058/http://www.sfrc.ufl.edu/4h/Laurel_oak/laureoak.htm Florida Forest Trees]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080602082544/http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/WO018 Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida: ''Laurel Oak or Swamp Laurel Oak?'']\n*Knight, H.

However, the swamp chestnut oak is a larger tree which differs in preferred habitat, and the [[bark]] does not have the distinctive deep, rugged ridging of the chestnut oak, being thinner, scaly, and paler gray. It typically grows to around 65&nbsp;feet (20 meters) tall, though the tallest specimen currently known is over 150 feet (42 meters) tall.\n\nThe name ''Q. prinus'' was long used by many botanists and foresters for the swamp chestnut oak, even when treated as a species distinct from the chestnut oak, which was then called ''Q. montana'', but the application of the name ''Q. prinus'' to the chestnut oak is now often accepted,<ref>The confusion arose from differing identifications of the [[type (biology)|type specimens]] for the [[Linnaeus|Linnaean]] name, by some (but not all) botanists considered resolved by close examination of the leaf pubescence, which differs in the two species.</ref> although sometimes that name is declared to be of uncertain position, unassignable to either species, with the chestnut oak then called ''[[Quercus montana|Q. montana]]'', as in the ''Flora of North America''<ref name=\"FNA Qmontana\">[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233501064 Flora of North America, ''Quercus montana'' Willdenow, 1805.

Young trees have a smooth, brown bark that becomes gray-black with rough scaly ridges as the tree matures. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, simple and tardily deciduous, remaining on the tree until mid-winter; they are 3\u201312&nbsp;cm (1\u20135&nbsp;in) long and 2\u20136&nbsp;cm (1/2\u20132 in) broad, variable in shape, most commonly shaped like a spatula being broad and rounded at the top and narrow and wedged at the base. The margins vary, usually being smooth to shallowly lobed, with a bristle at the apex and lobe tips. The tree is easy to identify by the leaves, which have a lobe that looks as if a drop of water is hanging from the end of the leaf. The top of each leaf is a dull green to bluish green and the bottom is a paler bluish-green. On the bottom portion of the leaves, rusty colored hairs run along the veins. The [[acorn]]s are arranged singly or in pairs, 10\u201314&nbsp;mm (1/3-1/2 in) long and broad, with a shallow cupule; they mature about 18 months after pollination in [[autumn|fall]] of second year.<ref>[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233501067 Flora of North America: ''Quercus nigra'']</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n[[Image:Quercus nigra.jpg|thumb|left|Water oak leaf cluster]]\nWater oak serves the same ecological role as [[Salix babylonica#Horticultural selections and related hybrids|weeping willow]] and other wetland trees. It is adapted to wet, [[swamp]]y areas, such as along [[pond]]s and stream banks, but can also tolerate well-drained sites and even heavy, compacted soils. It grows in sandy soils, red clays, and old fields to the borders of [[swamp]]s, [[stream]]s, to [[bottomland]]s. Due to its ability to grow and reproduce quickly, the water oak is often the most abundant species in a stand of trees. The tree is relatively short-lived compared to other oaks and may live only 60 to 80 years. It does not compete well and does not tolerate even light shade. Water oak is frequently used to restore bottomland [[hardwood forest]]s on land that was previously cleared for agriculture or pine plantations. Minimum age for flowering and fruiting is 20 years and the tree produces heavy crops of acorns nearly every year. Water oak is not recommended as an ornamental due to being short-lived, disease-prone, and extremely messy.\n\n[[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrids]] of water oak are known with southern red oak (''[[Quercus falcata]]''), bluejack oak (''[[Quercus incana]]''), turkey oak (''[[Quercus laevis]]''), blackjack oak (''[[Quercus marilandica]]''), willow oak (''[[Quercus phellos]]''), Shumard oak (''[[Quercus shumardii]]''), and black oak (''[[Quercus velutina]]'')\n\nWater oak acorns are an important food for [[white-tailed deer]], [[eastern gray squirrel]], [[raccoon]], [[wild turkey]], [[mallard]], [[wood duck]], and [[bobwhite quail]]. In winter, deer will browse the buds and young twigs.\n\n==Uses and history==\nWater oak has been used for timber and for [[firewood|fuel]] by people in the southern states since the 17th century. The wood is generally sold as \"red oak\", mixed with the wood from other red oaks.\n\nOther names include spotted oak, duck oak, punk oak, orange oak or possum oak.\n\n==References==\n{{commons|Quercus nigra}}\n{{reflist}}\n==External links==\n*C.Michael Hogan Ed. 2011.

Despite being massively planted in the U.S. South (such as [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Atlanta, Georgia]]) around malls, along roads, etc., the trees tend to grow larger than planners expect, which often leads to cracked sidewalks. One intriguing solution being tried in D.C. is to use 'rubber' sidewalks, made from recycled tires.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14030187  Rubber sidewalks take the sting out of falls.

Lobes are less deeply cut than most other oaks of the red oak group (except for [[Quercus velutina|black oak]] which can be similar). Leaves emerge from the bud convolute, pink, covered with soft silky down above, coated with thick white tomentum below. When full grown are dark green and smooth, sometimes shining above, yellow green, smooth or hairy on the axils of the veins below. In autumn they turn a rich red, sometimes brown.

Quality red oak is of high value as lumber and veneer, while defective logs are used as [[firewood]]. Other related oaks are also cut and marketed as red oak, although their wood is not always of as high a quality. These include [[eastern black oak]], [[scarlet oak]], [[pin oak]], [[Shumard oak]], [[southern red oak]] and other species in the red oak group. Construction uses include flooring, veneer, interior trim, and furniture. It is also used for lumber, railroad ties, and fence posts.\n\nRed oak wood grain is so open that smoke can be blown through it from end-grain to end-grain on a flat-sawn board. For this reason, it is subject to moisture infiltration and is unsuitable for outdoor uses such as boatbuilding or exterior trim.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n=== Ornamental use ===\n''Quercus rubra'' is grown in parks and large gardens as a specimen tree.<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector \u2013 ''Quercus rubra''|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=3485|accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> It is not planted as often as the closely related [[Pin Oak]] as it develops a taproot and quickly becomes difficult to transplant. Acorns should either be sown in the location where the tree is intended to be planted or else moved to their permanent location within the seedling's first year. As the tree gets older, the taproot gradually becomes less dominant and the lateral root network expands. Northern Red Oak is easy to start from seed, however the acorns must be protected from animal predation over the winter months.\n\nAs with other oaks, germination takes place in late spring when all frost danger has passed. The seedling grows rapidly for its first month, then pauses for another month, and sends out more new shoots until September when growth stops for the year. If the weather stays favorable, a third burst of growth may occur.\n\nThis oak is grown across Canada almost everywhere it will grow. It has naturalized in southeastern British Columbia near the Alberta border.\n\n== Famous specimens ==\n*[[Ashford Oak]] \u2013 A very large Northern Red Oak in [[Ashford, Connecticut|Ashford]], Connecticut. The tree has suffered falling limbs because of its great age.

Its [[Vivipary|viviparous]] \"seeds,\" in actuality called [[propagule]]s, become fully mature plants before dropping off the parent tree. These are dispersed by water until eventually embedding in the shallows.\n\n''Rhizophora mangle'' grows on [[Aerial root#Aerial roots as supports|aerial prop roots]], which arch above the water level, giving stands of this tree the characteristic \"[[mangrove]]\" appearance. It is a valuable plant in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas coastal ecosystems.  In its native habitat it is threatened by invasive species such as the [[Brazilian Pepper|Brazilian pepper tree ''(Schinus terebinthifolius)'']].  The red mangrove itself is considered an [[invasive species]] in some locations, such as [[Hawaii]], where it forms dense, [[monospecific]] thickets.<ref>Allen, J.A., 1998. Mangroves as Alien Species: The Case of Hawaii. ''Global Ecology and Biogeographical Letters'' 7:61-71</ref> ''R. mangle'' thickets, however, provide nesting and hunting habitat for a diverse array of organisms, including [[fish]], [[bird]]s, and [[crocodile]]s.\n\n==Habitat==\nRed mangroves are found in [[subtropical]] and [[tropical]] areas in both [[Earth|hemispheres]], extending to approximately 28\u00b0N to S latitude. They thrive on coastlines in [[brackish]] water and in swampy salt marshes. Because they are well adapted to salt water, they thrive where many other plants fail and create their own ecosystems, the [[mangrove|mangal]]s. Red mangroves are often found near white mangroves (''[[Laguncularia racemosa]]''), black mangroves (''[[Avicennia germinans]]''), and buttonwood (''[[Conocarpus erectus]]''). Through stabilisation of their surroundings, mangroves create a community for other plants and animals (such as the [[mangrove crab]]). Though rooted in soil, mangrove roots are often submerged in water for several hours or on a permanent basis. The roots are usually sunk in a [[sand]] or [[clay]] base, which allows for some protection from the waves.\n\n==Description==\nRed mangroves are easily distinguishable through their unique prop roots system and [[Vivipary|viviparous]] [[seed]]s. The prop roots of a red mangrove suspend it over the water, thereby giving it extra support and protection. They also help the tree to combat [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] by allowing it a direct intake of oxygen through its [[root]] structure. \n\nA mangrove can reach up to {{convert|80|ft|m}} in height in ideal conditions; however, it is commonly found at a more modest {{convert|20|ft|m}}. Its bark is thick and a grey-brown color. Mangrove leaves are {{convert|1|-|2|in|cm}} wide and {{convert|3|-|5|in|cm}} long, with smooth margins and an [[elliptical|ellipse]] shape. They are a darker shade of [[green]] on the tops than on the bottoms. The tree produces pale pink [[flower]]s in the spring.\n\n==Reproduction==\nAs a viviparous plant, ''R. mangle'' creates a propagule that is in reality a living tree. Though resembling an elongated seed pod, the fully-grown propagule on the mangrove is capable of rooting and producing a new tree. The trees are [[Plant sexuality|hermaphrodite]]s, capable of [[Self-pollination|self pollination]] or [[Anemophily|wind pollination]]. The tree undergoes no dormant stage as a seed, but rather progresses to a live plant before leaving its parent tree. A mangrove propagule may float in brackish water for over a year before rooting.\n\n==Common names==\nAs well as the English name \"red mangrove,\" ''R. mangle'' is known in [[Tonga]] as ''tongo''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rhizophora|url=http://eol.org/pages/60810/details|work=Encyclopedia of Life|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Red mangrove-everglades natl park.jpg|A free-standing red mangrove tree growing in shallow water in the backcountry of the [[Cape Sable]] area of [[Everglades National Park]].\nImage:Plody mangrovnika (Rhizophora mangle).jpg|Propagules growing before dropping from the parent plant.

The fruit attracts birds with no significant litter problem, is persistent on the tree and showy.\n\nThe bark is thin and easily damaged from mechanical impact; branches droop as the tree grows, and will require pruning for vehicular or pedestrian clearance beneath the canopy; routinely grown with, or trainable to be grown with, multiple trunks.  The tree wants to grow with several trunks but can be trained to grow with a single trunk.  It has no thorns.\n\n==Cultivation==\n\nThe tree can be planted in a container or above-ground planter; recommended for buffer strips around parking lots or for median strip plantings in the highway; reclamation plant; specimen; tree has been successfully grown in urban areas where air pollution, poor drainage, compacted soil, and/or drought are common.\n\nThe tree grows in full sun or part shade.  Soil tolerances include clay, loam, sand, slightly alkaline, acidic, and well-drained soil.  Its drought tolerance is high.<ref>[http://hort.ufl.edu/trees/RHUCOPA.pdf ''Rhus copallina'' Shining Sumac by Edward F. Gilman and Dennis G.

C. |last=Huntley |accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref> and therefore is typical of young woodlands disturbed areas where sunlight is plentiful and soil is dry, in this sense, black locust can often grow as a weed tree. It also often spreads by underground shoots or [[sucker (botany)|suckers]] which contribute to the weedy character of this species.<ref name=\"dirr\" /> Young trees are often spiny, however, mature trees often lack spines. In the early summer black locust flowers; the flowers are large and appear in large, intensely fragrant (reminiscent of orange blossoms), clusters. The leaflets fold together in wet weather and at night ([[nyctinasty]]) as some change of position at night is a habit of the entire [[fabaceae|leguminous]] family.\n<!--there's redundant info from the more detailed section below, but this is intended as an intro-->\n\nAlthough similar in general appearance to the [[honey locust]], it lacks that tree's characteristic long branched thorns on the trunk, instead having the pairs of short prickles at the base of each leaf; the leaflets are also much broader then honey locust. It may also resemble [[Styphnolobium japonicum]] which has smaller flower spikes and lacks spines.\n\n=== Detailed description ===\n[[File:Black Locust Leaf Close Up.jpg|thumb|left|One black locust leaf showing 13 leaflets]]\n*The '''bark''' is dark gray brown and tinged with red or orange in the grooves. It is deeply furrowed into grooves and ridges which run up and down the trunk and often cross and form diamond shapes.<ref name=\"dirr\" />\n*The '''roots''' of black locust contain [[Root Nodules|nodules]] which allow it to [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] as is common within the pea family.\n*The '''branches''' are typically zig-zagy and may have ridges and grooves or may be round.<ref name=\"dirr\" /> When young, they are at first coated with white silvery down, this soon disappears and they become pale green and afterward reddish or greenish brown.\n*'''[[prickle (botany)|Prickles]]''' may or may not be present on young trees, root [[sucker (botany)|suckers]], and branches near the ground; typically, branches high above the ground rarely contain prickles. ''R. pseudoacacia'' is quite variable in the quantity and amount of prickles present as some trees are densely prickly and other trees have no prickles at all. The prickles typically remain on the tree until the young thin bark to which they are attached is replaced by the thicker mature bark. They develop from [[stipules]]<ref name=\"foc\" /> (small leaf like structures which grow at the base of leaves) and since stipules are paired at the base of leaves, the prickles will be paired at the bases of leaves. They range from {{convert|.25-.8|in|cm}} in length and are somewhat triangular with a flared base and sharp point. Their color is of a dark purple and they adhere only to the bark.<ref name=\"foc\">{{eFloras|2|200012304|Robinia pseudoacacia|accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref>\n*'''Wood''': Pale yellowish brown; heavy, hard, strong, close-grained and very durable in contact with the ground. The wood has a [[specific gravity]] of 0.7333, and a weight of approximately 45.7 pounds per cubic foot.\n*The '''leaves''' are [[compound leaf|compound]], meaning that each leaf contains many smaller leaf like structures called [[leaflet (botany)|leaflets]], the leaflets are roughly paired on either side of the stem which runs through the leaf ([[rachis]]) and there is typically one leaflet at the tip of the leaf ([[Glossary of leaf morphology#imparipinnate|odd pinnate]]). The leaves are alternately arranged on the stem. Each leaf is {{convert|6-14|in|cm}} long and contains 9-19 leaflets, each being {{convert|1-2|in|cm}}long, and {{convert|.25-.75|in|cm}} wide. The leaflets are rounded or slightly indented at the tip and typically rounded at the base. The leaves come out of the bud folded in half, yellow green, covered with silvery down which soon disappears. Each leaflet initially has a minute stipel, which quickly falls, and is connected to the ([[rachis]]) by a short stem or petiolule. The leaves are attached to the branch with slender hairy [[petiole (botany)|petioles]] which is grooved and swollen at the base. The [[stipule]]s are linear, downy, membranous at first and occasionally develop into prickles. The leaves appear relatively late in spring.\n*The '''leaf color''' of the fully grown leaves is a dull dark green above and paler beneath.  In the fall the leaves turn a clear pale yellow.\n[[File:Robinia pseudoacacia 004.JPG|thumb|upright|Closeup of flowers]]\n\n*The '''flowers''' open in May or June for 7\u201310 days, after the leaves have developed. They are arranged in loose drooping clumps ([[raceme]]s) which are typically {{convert|4-8|in|cm}} long.<ref name=\"dirr\" /> The flowers themselves are cream-white (rarely pink or purple) with a pale yellow blotch in the center and imperfectly [[papilionaceous]] in shape. They are  about {{convert|1|in|cm}} wide, very fragrant, and produce large amounts of nectar. Each flower is perfect, having both [[stamens]] and a [[pistil]] (male and female parts). There are 10 stamens enclosed within the petals; these are fused together in a diadelphous configuration, where the [[stamen|filaments]] of 9 are all joined to form a tube and one stamen is separate and above the joined stamens. The single ovary is superior and contains several ovules. Below each flower is a [[Calyx (flower)|calyx]] which looks like leafy tube between the flower and the stem. It is made from fused [[sepal]]s and is dark green and may be blotched with red. The [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]] (stems which connect the flower to the branch) are slender, {{convert|.5|in|cm}}, dark red or reddish green.\n*The '''fruit''' is a typical [[legume]] fruit, being a flat and smooth pea-like pod {{convert|2-4|in|cm}} long and {{convert|.5|in|cm}} broad. The fruit usually contains 4-8 seeds.<ref name=\"dirr\" /> The seeds are dark orange brown with irregular markings. They ripen late in autumn and hang on the branches until early spring.<ref name=\"Keeler\">{{cite book | last =Keeler | first =Harriet L. | title =Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them | publisher =Charles Scriber's Sons | year =1900 | location =New York | pages =97\u2013102 }}</ref> There are typically 25500 seeds per pound.<ref name=\"usda factsheet\" />\n*'''Winter [[bud]]s''': Minute, naked (having no scales covering them), three or four together, protected in a depression by a scale-like covering lined on the inner surface with a thick coat of tomentum and opening in early spring.

The flowers are pollinated by insects, primarily by [[Hymenoptera]]n insects. The physical construction of the flower separates the male and female parts so that self-pollination will not typically occur.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/asu/f/Houser,%20Cameron_2014_%20Thesis.pdf|title=GENETICALLY MEDIATED LEAF CHEMISTRY IN INVASIVE AND NATIVE BLACK LOCUST (ROBINIA PSEUDOACACIA L.)

The roots may grow suckers after damage (by being hit with a lawn mower or otherwise damaged) or after no damage at all.  The suckers are stems which grow from the roots, directly into the air and may grow into full trees. The main trunk also has the capability to grow sprouts and will do so after being cut down.<ref name=\"eedd\">{{cite web|title=Robinia pseudoacacia|url=https://www.eddmaps.org/ipane/ipanespecies/trees/Robinia_pseudoacacia.htm|website=www.eddmaps.org|accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref> This makes removal of black locust difficult as the suckers need to be continually removed from both the trunk and roots or the tree will regrow. This is considered an [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] form or reproduction.\n\nThe suckers allow black locust to grow into colonies which are often exclude other species. These colonies may form dense thickets which shade out competition.<ref name=\"mdnr\">{{cite web|title=Black locust invasive species control|url=https://mnfi.anr.msu.edu/invasive-species/BlackLocustBCP.pdf|publisher=Michigan DNR|accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref>\nBlack locust has been found to have either 2n=20 or 2n=22 chromosomes.\n\n=== Human mediated dispersal ===\nBlack locust has been spread and used as a plant for erosion control as it is fast growing and generally a tough tree.<ref name=\"usda factsheet\">{{cite web|title=Robinia psudeoacacia factsheet|url=http://plants.usda.gov/factsheet/pdf/fs_rops.pdf|website=USDA|accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref> The wood, considered the most durable wood in America, has been very desirable and motivated people to move the tree to areas where it is not native so the wood can be farmed and used.\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Robinia pseudoacacia seeds.jpg|thumb|''Robinia pseudoacacia'' seeds]]\nWhen growing in sandy areas this plant can enrich the soil by means of its nitrogen-fixing nodules, allowing other species to move in.<ref name=\"eedd\" /> On sandy soils black locust may also often replace other vegetation which cannot fix nitrogen.<ref name=\"usda factsheet\" />\n\nBlack locust is a typical early successional plant, a [[pioneer species]], it grows best in bright sunlight and does not handle shade well.<ref name=\"sylv\" /> It specializes in colonizing disturbed and edges of woodlots before it is eventually replaced with more shade tolerant species. It prefers dry to moist limestone soils but will grow on most soils as long as they are not wet or poorly drained.<ref name=\"sylv\" />  This tree tolerates a soil pH range of 4.6 to 8.2.<ref name=\"usda factsheet\" /> Within its native range it will often grow on soils of [[Inceptisols]], [[Ultisols]], and [[Alfisols]] groups. Black locust does not do well on compacted, clayey or eroded soils. Black locust is a part of the [[Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests]].\n\nBlack locust is not a particularly valuable plant for wildlife, but does provide valuable cover when planted on previously open areas. Its seeds are also eaten by [[bobwhite quail]] and other game birds and squirrels. Woodpeckers may also nest in the trunk since older trees are often infected by heart rot.\n\n== Pests ==\nLocust leaf miner ''[[Odontota dorsalis]]'' attacks the tree in spring and turns the leaves brown by mid summer, it slows the growth of the tree but not seriously.<ref name=\"usda factsheet\" /> The locust borer ''[[Megacyllene robiniae]]'' larvae carve tunnels into the trunk of the tree and make it more prone to being knocked down by the wind.  Heart rot is the only significant disease affecting black locust.<ref name=\"usda factsheet\" /> Black locust is also attacked by ''[[Chlorogenus robiniae]]'', a virus which causes [[witch's broom]] growths, clear leaflet veins are a symptom of the disease.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hSzjzDCixZQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Internationally dangerous forest tree diseases, Issues 911-940|last=|first=|publisher=USDA|year=1963|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n\n=== Cultivation ===\nBlack locust is a [[Northern Nectar Sources for Honeybees|major honey plant]] in the eastern US, and has been planted in European countries. In many European countries, it is the source of the renowned [[monofloral honey|acacia honey]]. Flowering starts after 140 [[growing degree day]]s. However, its blooming period is short (about 10 days) and it does not consistently produce a honey crop year after year. Weather conditions can have quite an effect on the amount of nectar collected, as well; in [[Ohio]] for example, good locust honey flow happens in one of five years.<ref>http://www.beeclass.com/DTS/blacklocust.htm</ref>\n\nIt can be easily propagated from roots, softwood, or hardwood<ref name=\"dirr\" /><ref name=\"usda factsheet\" /> and this allows for easy reproduction of the plant. Cultivars may also be [[grafting|grafted]] as this ensures the parent and daughter plant will be genetically identical.[[File:Robinia pseudoacacia 'Frisia'.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The golden 'Frisia' cultivar planted as an [[ornamental tree]]]]''R. pseudoacacia'' is considered an excellent plant for growing in highly disturbed areas as an erosion control plant.<ref name=\"usda factsheet\" /> The roots are shallow aggressive which help to hold onto soil and the tree grows quickly and on poor soils due to its ability to fix nitrogen.\n\nBlack locust has [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[bacteria]] on its root system, so it can grow on poor soils and is an early colonizer of disturbed areas. With fertilizer prices rising, the importance of black locust as a nitrogen-fixing species is also noteworthy. The mass application of fertilizers in agriculture and forestry is increasingly expensive; therefore nitrogen-fixing tree and shrub species are gaining importance in managed forestry.<ref name=\"fao bl\" />\n\nIt is also planted for firewood because it grows rapidly, is highly resilient in a variety of soils, and it grows back even faster from its stump after harvest by using the existing root system.<ref name=\"OSU managing your woodlot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.forestry.ok.gov/Websites/forestry/Images/Managing%20Your%20Woodlot%20for%20Firewood.pdf|title=OSU: Managing Your Woodlot for Firewood}}</ref> (see [[coppicing]])\n\nIn Europe, it is often planted along streets and in parks, especially in large cities, because it tolerates pollution well.\n\n==== Cultivars ====\nSeveral cultivars exist but 'Frisia' seems to be one of the most planted ones.\n*'Decaisneana' has been considered a cultivar but is more accurately a hybrid (''R. psudeoacacia'' x ''R. viscosa'').

A large and attractive palm, it has been planted throughout the tropics and subtropics as an ornamental tree.  Although it is sometimes called ''R. elata'', the [[conserved name]] ''R. regia'' is now the correct name for the species.  Populations in [[Cuba]] and [[Florida]] were long seen as separate species, but are now considered to belong to a single species.\n\nBest known as an ornamental, ''R.&nbsp;regia'' is also used as a source of thatch, construction timber, and in some forms of so-called traditional medicine, although there is currently no valid scientific evidence to support the efficacy or use of any palm species for medicinal purposes.  The fruit is eaten by birds and bats (which disperse the seeds) and fed to livestock.  Its flowers are visited by birds and bats, and it serves as a roosting site and food source for a variety of animals.  ''Roystonea regia'' is the [[List of national trees|national tree]] of [[Cuba]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cubanaturaleza.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=30&Itemid=31 |title=Cuban Royal Palm (''Roystonea regia''), national tree of Cuba |publisher=Cuba Naturaleza |accessdate=2009-04-21}}</ref> and has a religious role both in [[Santer\u00eda]] and Christianity, where it is used in [[Palm Sunday]] observances.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Crownshaft Roystonea -1.JPG|left|thumb|View of a mature individual in Florida from below.

[[Liberty Hyde Bailey]]'s use of the name in his 1949 revision of the genus, established its usage.<ref name = Zona1994/>\n\nHarper's new combination immediately supplanted Cook's ''R.&nbsp;floridana'', but there was disagreement as to whether Cuban and Floridian populations represented a single species or two species.  Zona's revision of the genus concluded that they both belonged to the same species.  According to the rules of botanical nomenclature, the correct name of the species should have been ''Roystonea elata''.  Zona pointed out, however, that the name ''R.&nbsp;regia'' (or ''Oreodoxa regia'') has a history of use in horticulture that dated from at least 1838, and that the species had been propagated around the world under that name.  ''Roystonea elata'', on the other hand, had only been used since 1949, and was used much less widely.

(6.1&nbsp;m) in height in the western part of its range. Solitary trees though can grow as tall as 50&nbsp;ft. (15.2&nbsp;m) in height. In the western part of its range it is most often found growing at the head of prairie ravines, the margins of woodlands, the edges of fields or on rocky hillsides.\n\nThe leaves of the soapberry are alternate, pinnately compound, thick and leathery but deciduous, 8&nbsp;in. (20&nbsp;cm) to 15&nbsp;in. (38&nbsp;cm) in length, made up of 6 to 20 narrow lanceolate leaflets with smooth margins, long tapered tips, and uneven wedge-shaped bases which are 2&nbsp;in. to 5&nbsp;in. (5&nbsp;cm to 13&nbsp;cm) long and .75&nbsp;in. to 1.5&nbsp;in. (2&nbsp;cm to &nbsp;cm) wide. Midveins on leaves of var. ''saponaria'' are mostly winged, while those of var. ''drummondii'' are never winged.\n\nThe inflorescence are dense terminal panicles of small white flowers 6&nbsp;in. to 10&nbsp;in (15&nbsp;cm to 20&nbsp;cm) long. Flowering occurs in May\u2013June for var. ''drummondii'' and in November for var. ''saponaria''.\n\nThe fruit occur in large pyramidal clusters at the ends of branches. Each golden colored fruit is between 1.2&nbsp;in. to 1.4&nbsp;in. (3&nbsp;cm to 3.6&nbsp;cm) in diameter and becomes translucent and wrinkled when fully mature and contains a single black seed about .35&nbsp;in (9&nbsp;mm) in diameter. Fruits of var. ''drummondii'' ripen in October and often remain on the tree until spring, while those of var. ''saponaria'' ripen in spring.\n\nThe twigs of var. ''drummondii'' are gray-brown and hairy with short tan colored hairs while those of var. ''saponaria'' are gray and hairless. Buds on var. ''drummondii'' are small dark brown and hairy while those on var. ''saponaria'' are small brown and hairless.\n\nThe trunk of var. ''drummondii'' has light gray, scaly with thin plate like bark and sometimes shallowly furrowed while var. ''saponaria'' has gray to reddish colored scaly bark.\n\n==Subspecies==\n\n*S. s. var.

Common names include '''paradise-tree''', '''dysentery-bark''', and '''bitterwood'''.<ref name=\"GRIN\"/> Its seeds produce an [[Vegetable oil|edible oil]]. The tree is well suited for warm, humid, tropical regions. Its cultivation depends on rainfall distribution, water holding capacity of the soil and sub-soil moisture. It is suited for temperature range of {{convert|10|to|40|C|F}}. It can grow at elevations from [[sea level]] to {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It grows {{convert|40|to|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall and has a span of {{convert|25|to|30|ft|m|abbr=on}}. It bears yellow [[flower]]s and oval elongated purple colored fleshy [[fruit]]s.\n\n==Cultivation==\nIt can be propagated from seeds, grafting and [[tissue culture]] technology. Fruits are collected in the month of April / May, when they are ripe and then dried in sun for about a week. Skin is separated and seeds are grown in [[plastic bag]]s to produce saplings. Saplings 2 to 3 months old can be transplanted to a plantation.\n\n==Environmental impact==\nThe tree forms a well-developed [[root system]] and dense evergreen canopy that efficiently checks [[Erosion|soil erosion]], supports soil microbial life, and improves groundwater position. Besides converting [[Solar power|solar energy]] into biochemical energy all round the year, it checks overheating of the soil surface all through the year and particularly during summer. Large-scale planting in wastelands facilitates wasteland reclamation, converts the accumulated atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] into oxygen and contributes to the reduction of [[greenhouse effect]] or [[global warming]].\u2022\tThe wood is generally insect resistant and is used in the preparation of quality furniture, toys, in match industry, as pulp (in paper making) as fuel and the oil is free from bad cholesterol. It can be also used for industrial purposes in the manufacture of BIOFUELS, soaps, detergents, lubricants, varnishes, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals etc.<ref>[http://news.oneindia.in/2007/04/15/lakshmi-taru-tree-answer-to-climate-change-problems-experts-1176620662.html Lakshmi Taru tree answer to climate change problems: experts]</ref>\n\n{{commons category}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* [http://econpapers.repec.org/paper/agsuasbcp/43624.htm Simarouba Glauca DC] Joshi Shyamsundar and Shantha Joshi.                        \n*[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Simarouba%20Glauca Dictionary.com]\n\n[[Category:Simaroubaceae]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1811]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Bahamas]]\n[[Category:Trees of Central America]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Hispaniola]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puerto Rico]]\n[[Category:Trees of Cuba]]\n[[Category:Trees of Jamaica]]\n[[Category:Trees of Southern Mexico]]\n\n\n{{tree-stub}}\n{{Sapindales-stub}}",

The leaves are also used to [[Abortifacient|induce]] [[abortion]], while a [[poultice]] made from crushed leaves is used for [[hemorrhoid]]s and [[scrofula]]. Heated leaves are applied to the forehead as an [[analgesic]] for [[headache]]s and a leaf [[decoction]] is used for [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]]. A [[root]] decoction is used to treat [[dysentery]], [[fever]], [[diarrhea]], [[Digestion|digestive]] problems, and violent body pains. The root bark is used as an [[anti-inflammatory]] and to treat [[arthritis]]. In [[West Africa]], a decoction made from the leaves is used to treat [[leprosy]], [[sexually-transmitted disease]]s, and [[malaria]] due to its [[laxative]] and [[diuretic]] effects.<ref name=\"Gurib-Fakim\"/> \n\n===Non-medicinal===\nThe leaves are used in the [[Philippines]] to clean [[Fat|grease]] from dishes. The berries are [[Toxin|toxic]] to humans, causing [[headache]], [[cramp]]s, and [[nausea]], but are cooked and eaten in [[Southeast Asia]] and made into [[curry]] in [[South Indian cuisine|southern India]]. They are a component of [[arrow poison]] in [[Tropical Asia]].

Spain itself had no timber suitable for building ships and its unfriendly relations with northern Europe made drawing supplies from that source impossible; consequently  it obtained timber from San Domingo, Cuba and Jamaica for building many ships of the Spanish Armada prior to 1588. A number of the largest Spanish ships were built of West Indies mahogany.<ref name=\"Mell1930\" />\n\nSpain turned to Cuba for supplies of timber suitable for ship masts, since the rebellion in Flanders (the [[Eighty Years' War]] began in 1566) had shut off that source.<ref name=\"Wright1916\" /> According to a passage quoted by the British naval historian, Halton Stirling Lecky, Spain continued building ships from West Indies mahogany for two hundred more years: \"...Several Spanish men-of-war were captured by the British during naval battles. One of these, the ''Gibraltar'', of 80 guns, captured by Lord Rodney off Cape St. Vincent was broken up in the royal dock yard at Pembroke, and though she must have been one of the oldest ships afloat, yet all her timbers were so sound as when they were put into her, and the whole British navy, and if I (Capt. Chaffell, secretary of the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company) am not mistaken, are now supplied with tables made out of the ''Gibraltar'' timbers. The ''Gibraltar'' was captured in 1780 and was finally broken up in 1836.\"<ref name=\"Lecky1914\">{{cite book|author=Halton Stirling Lecky|title=The King's Ships, Vol. 3, by Halton Stirling Lecky|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ep3bYgEACAAJ|volume=III|year=1914|publisher=Horace Muirhead, London|page=153}}</ref>\n\nThe dissemination of [[Clayton Dissinger Mell]]'s 1917 monograph on the subject, \"True Mahogany\", resulted in the increased use of mahogany in ship construction: \"It is particularly suited for planking, waterways, bulwarks, rails, skylights and companions, bitts, gangway ladders, and other deck work. With the later employment of iron, steel and teak in shipbuilding, mahogany became far more important as a furniture wood, though it is still preferred to any other wood for the framework of small sailing vessels. Large sailing vessels with mahogany framework were sold for enormous prices and manufactured into fine furniture.\"<ref name=\"Mell1917\"/>\n\nDuring World War II mahogany was used in the construction of small boats from the 21-24 meter (70 to 80 foot) PT boats (motor Patrol Torpedo) to the small rescue boats that were parachuted from rescue planes; its use for boat construction increased from 1,350 M board feet in 1940 to 21,500 M board feet in 1943.<ref name=\"Lamb1966\" /> PT boats were often made of diagonally layered {{convert|25|mm|in|adj=mid|-thick|0}} mahogany planks with a glue-impregnated layer of canvas in between. As a testament to the strength of this type of construction, several PT boats withstood catastrophic battle damage and still remained afloat. The most notable of those instances involved the ''PT-109'', then commanded by a young officer, [[John F. Kennedy]], who later became the President of the United States. The forward half of his boat stayed afloat for 12 hours after she was rammed by a Japanese destroyer.\n\nThe U.S. Navy Bureau of Ships approves mahogany for use in small boats and high-speed boats that require a wood easy to work, medium in weight but adequate in strength, with low shrinking, swelling, and warping characteristics, and high decay resistance.<ref name=\"Bureau of Ships\">Bureau of Ships. ''Wood: a manual for its use in wooden vessels.'' Forest Products Lab., Bureau of Ships, Washington D.C. 1945. pp.229.</ref> In 1966, mahogany still held an important place in the construction of yachts, launches, motorboats, and small boats of various kinds. In large ships its use is confined largely to interior trim, paneling, and furniture. In a large luxury liner, the volume for such uses may be considerable.<ref name=\"Lamb1966\" />\n\n===Furniture===\nThe Spanish explorers were quick to appreciate West Indies Mahogany's special properties; its early importation and use in cabinetwork is attested by the 16th century provenance of some fine [[Spanish Renaissance]] pieces.<ref name=\"Aronson1967\">{{cite book|author=Joseph Aronson|title=The New Encyclopedia of Furniture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jIFCAAAAIAAJ&dq=Spanish+Renaissance|year=1967|publisher=Crown Publishers|page=289}}</ref> [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] is said to have been interested in samples of mahogany brought by Sir Walter Raleigh on his return from [[Trinidad]] in 1595.<ref name=Rolf>Rolf, R.A. ''The True Mahoganies''. Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information. Vol. No. 4. 1919. p. 202. Kew Gardens.

The [[Empire style]] of furniture featured its use extensively, and the [[Federal architecture|Federal Style]] (1780-1830) in American furniture design is essentially a mahogany style.<ref name=\"Aronson1967\" /> Mell's paper of 1917 refers to its extensive use in the early 20th century, but its importance for some purposes has diminished. Mahogany was formerly much used for the interior finish of railroad parlor cars, public buildings, hotels, and dwellings and for office fixtures. It also was used extensively in the manufacture of [[fortepiano]]s, astronomical and surveying instruments, and cases for delicate apparatuses such as scales, microscopes, and [[microtome]]s.\n\n''S. mahagoni'' mahogany is used to make modern musical instruments because of its superior [[tonewood]] qualities. It is sometimes utilized in the top of guitars as well as the back, sides and neck, and is not uncommon in older mandolins. The wood is also used in the manufacture of electric guitars such as the [[Gibson Les Paul]] models: the [[Les Paul Custom|Custom]], the [[Gibson Les Paul#Deluxe|Deluxe]] and the [[Gibson Les Paul Studio|Studio]]. Three-ply laminations of mahogany, [[Populus|poplar]] and mahogany are found in top of the line drum shells. Mahogany is used for the wooden bars of [[marimba]]s.\n\n===Botanical history===\nBefore the [[American revolution]], botanists from Europe had explored and described the flora of the Carolinas, Florida, and the Bahamas. Fifty-six years before naturalist and illustrator [[John James Audubon]] was born, Volume Two of Mark Catesby's folio sized natural history was published in 1729.<ref name=\"Catesby1729\" /> Catesby's hand-colored plate of the mahogany tree, along with a description in English and French (not Latin as might have been expected), was the basis for Linnaeus using his new binomial nomenclature to name it.<ref name=\"Lamb1966\"/> When Linnaeus' description was published in 1758 as ''Cedrela mahagoni'',<ref>Linnaeus, Carolus: ''Systema Natura'' 10,2: p. 940. 1758.</ref> mahogany had been well known for more than 200 years to the lumber and woodworking trades. Two years later, [[Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin]] reclassified it and placed the West Indies Mahogany Tree into his newly created genus, ''Swietenia''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Enumeratio systematica plantarum, quas in insulis Caribaeis vicinaque Americes continente detexit novas, aut jam cognitas emendavit|year=1760|publisher=Lugduni Batavorum, Apud T.

The [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]] of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) lists ''S. mahagoni'' in Appendix II (only saw-logs, sawn wood and veneers).

Many [[botanist]]s treat it as a [[variety (biology)|variety]] of bald cypress, ''[[Taxodium distichum]]'' (as ''T. distichum'' var. ''imbricarium'') rather than as a distinct species, but it differs in [[ecology]], occurring mainly in still [[blackwater river]]s, [[pond]]s and [[swamp]]s without silt-rich flood deposits. It predominates in [[cypress dome]] habitats.\n\n==Description==\n''Taxodium ascendens'' reaches on average {{convert|15|-|18|m}} in height. Compared to ''T. distichum'', the [[leaf|leaves]] are shorter (3\u201310&nbsp;mm long), slenderer and are on shoots that tend to be erect rather than spreading. The trunk is expanded at the base, even on young trees, assisting the tree in anchoring in the soft, muddy soil. The [[conifer cone|cones]] also tend to be smaller, not over 2.5&nbsp;cm diameter. The [[bark]] is also a paler gray color. Like Bald Cypresses, Pond Cypresses growing in water have a characteristic growth trait called '''[[cypress knee]]s'''; these are woody projections [[pneumatophore]]s sent above the water from the [[root]]s, probably enabling this plant to breathe air in habitat with waterlogged soil. Maximum longevity of this plant is estimated at 1000 years. This figure may be an underestimate, as [[The Senator (tree)|The Senator]], until recently growing in Longwood, Florida's Big Tree Park, was estimated to be over 3,400 years old.\n\n==Distribution==\nThis species is native to the [[Southeastern United States|southeastern]] [[United States]], from southeastern [[Virginia]] to southeastern [[Louisiana]] and south into Florida except for the [[Florida Keys]].\n\nStunted individuals of pond cypress are notable in the '''dwarf cypress savanna''' of the [[Everglades National Park]].\n\n==Habitat==\n[[File:Taxodium ascendens in the Black Water, Okefenokee.jpg|thumb|Taxodium ascendens in the Black Water, [[Okefenokee Swamp]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], USA]]\n''Taxodium ascendens'' occurs naturally in shallow ponds, lake margins, swamps and wetlands.

The [[bark]] is gray-brown to red-brown, thin and fibrous with a stringy texture, having a vertically interwoven pattern of shallow ridges and narrow furrows. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate and linear, with flat blades borne on the [[branch|twig]] that are spirally arranged on the stem, but twisted at the base to lie in two horizontal ranks, 1\u20132&nbsp;cm long and 1\u20132&nbsp;mm broad.  Unlike most other species in the family Cupressaceae, it is [[deciduous]], losing its leaves in the winter months, hence the name 'bald'. It is [[Plant sexuality#Individual plant sexuality|monoecious]] (separate staminate and carpellate flowers are always found on the same plant), with male and female flowers forming on slender tassel-like structures near the edge of the branchlets. The male and female [[strobili]] are produced from buds formed in the late fall, with pollination in early winter, and mature in about 12 months. The [[conifer cone|seed cones]] are green maturing gray-brown, globular, and 2-3.5&nbsp;cm in diameter. They have from 20 to 30 spirally arranged, four-sided scales, each bearing one or two (rarely three) triangular [[seed]]s. The number of seeds per cone ranges from 20 to 40. The cones disintegrate when mature to release the large seeds. The seeds are 5\u201310&nbsp;mm long, the largest of any species in the cypress family, and are produced every year, but with heavy crops every three to five years. The seedlings have three to 9 (most often six) [[cotyledon]]s.<ref name=farjon/>\n\nThe main trunks are surrounded by [[cypress knees]].\n\nThe tallest known individual specimen, near [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], is 44.11 m tall, and the stoutest known, in the [[Cat Island National Wildlife Refuge]] near [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], has a [[diameter at breast height]] (DBH) of 521&nbsp;cm.<ref name=gd/> The oldest known specimen, located in [[Bladen County, North Carolina]], is over 1,620 years old, making this one of the oldest living plants in eastern North America.<ref>http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~adk/oldlisteast/Spp/TADI.html</ref>\n\n{{Gallery\n|File:Bald Cypress Leaves 2264px.jpg|Foliage\n|File:Baldcypress cone.jpg|Cones\n|File:Bald Cypress Taxodium distichum Fingers.JPG|Knees\n|File:Bald Cypress Taxodium distichum Bark Vertical.JPG|Bark\n}}\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe closely related ''[[Taxodium ascendens]]'' (pond cypress) is treated by some botanists as a distinct species,<ref name=usda>USDA Plants Profiles: [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=TADI2 ''Taxodium distichum''], [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=TAAS ''Taxodium ascendens'']</ref> while others classify it as merely a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of bald-cypress,<ref name=farjon/><ref name=gd/> as ''Taxodium distichum'' var. ''imbricatum'' (Nutt.) Croom. It differs in shorter leaves borne on erect shoots, and in ecology, being largely confined to low-nutrient [[blackwater river|blackwater]] habitats. A few authors also treat ''[[Taxodium mucronatum]]'' as a variety of bald cypress, as ''T. distichum'' var. ''mexicanum'' Gordon, thereby considering the genus as comprising only one species.<ref name=fna1>{{eFloras|1|132353|Taxodium}}</ref>\n\n==Habitat==\n[[Image:Bald Cypress.JPG|thumb|left|Bald cypress in [[Trap Pond State Park]], [[Delaware]]]]\n\n=== Range ===\n[[File:Baldcypress range.jpg|thumb|right|Bald cypress range]]\n[[File:Caddo Lake- Cypress.jpg|thumb|right|Bald cypress on the [[Texas]] side of [[Caddo Lake]]]]\n\nThe native range extends from [[Delaware Bay]] south to Florida and west to East Texas and southeastern Oklahoma, and also inland up the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers north to southern Illinois. The oldest found reside in [[North Carolina]], but older ones may exist elsewhere. Mature planted specimens are seen as far north as [[Pittsburgh]],<ref>http://www.pittsburghforest.org/userfiles/file/Lawrenceville%20Tree%20of%20the%20Month/LV_Tree_of_Month_03_Bald_Cypress.pdf</ref> and Ottawa, Ontario.<ref>{{cite book|title=For the Love of Trees|author=Richard Hinchcliff|pages=52\u201353|isbn=978-1-897113-73-8|publisher=General Store Publishing |date=2007}}</ref> In Ottawa, in the Central Experimental Farm Arboretum, an average winter may kill back a quarter to half of new growth. Ancient bald cypress [[forest]]s, with some trees more than 1,700 years old, once dominated [[swamp]]s in the southeast US. The largest remaining old-growth stands are at [[Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary]], near [[Naples, Florida|Naples]], [[Florida]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} and in the Three Sisters tract along eastern North Carolina's [[Black River (North Carolina)|Black River]]. The Corkscrew trees are around 500 years of age and some exceed 40 m in height. The Black River trees were cored by David Stahle from the [[University of Arkansas]]. He is a [[dendrochronologist]] and his dates range back to 364 AD.<ref>{{cite web\n   |url=http://www.pocosinpress.com/Methuselah.pdf\n   |format=PDF|title=Searching for Methuselah\n   |pages= 1\u20133\n   |author=Paul Ferguson\n   |year=2008\n   |publisher=Pocosin Press\n   |accessdate=21 April 2011\n}}</ref> In the northern and more inland part of its range from Delaware and Maryland to Williamsburg, Virginia, it is found in groups growing in swamps and is accompanied by other hardwoods. In the southern parts of its range from extreme southeastern Virginia, [[Virginia Beach]] south to Florida and west to Texas, bald cypress can be found growing with [[loblolly pine]] and [[live oak]], and it may be heavily covered in [[Spanish moss]]. This can be observed in the far northern part of its range at [[First Landing State Park]], Virginia Beach, Virginia. From eastern North Carolina down throughout Florida and over to southeast and south Texas, bald cypress may be accompanied in forests by [[sabal minor|dwarf palmetto]].\n\nIt is native to humid climates where annual precipitation ranges from about 760&nbsp;mm (in Texas) to 1630&nbsp;mm (along the Gulf Coast). Although it grows best in warm climates, the natural northern limit of the species is not due to a lack of cold tolerance, but to specific reproductive requirements; further north, regeneration is prevented by [[ice]] damage to seedlings. Larger trees are able to tolerate much lower temperatures and lower humidity.\n\nIn 2012 [[Scuba diving|Scuba]] divers discovered an underwater forest several miles off the coast of Mobile, AL in 60 feet of water. The forest contains trees that could not be dated with radiocarbon methods since they are older than 50,000 years old, thus most likely lived in the early glacial interval of the last ice age. The forest contains trees so well-preserved that when they are cut, they still smell like fresh cypress. The team, which has not yet published their results in a peer-reviewed journal, is currently studying the site. It is estimated that they have less than two years before wood-burrowing marine animals destroy the submerged forest.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Primeval Underwater Forest Discovered in Gulf of Mexico|url=http://www.livescience.com/37977-underwater-cypress-forest-discovered.html|publisher=Live Science|accessdate=11 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Soils and topography ===\nMost bald cypress trees grow on flat ground on [[alluvium|alluvial]] soils, usually at elevations of less than 50 m above sea level, although some stands may occur at elevations of 500 m in Texas.\n\nBald cypress occurs mainly along [[riparian]] (riverside) wetlands normally subject to periodic flooding by silt-rich 'brownwater' rivers, unlike the related ''[[Taxodium ascendens]]'', which occurs in silt-poor [[blackwater river]]s and [[pond]]s. ''T. distichum'' tolerates minor salinity, but does not grow in brackish or saline coastal waters.\n\n==Reproduction and early growth==\n[[File:2014-11-02 14 12 30 Bald Cypress foliage during autumn along Hunters Ridge Drive in Hopewell Township, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|right|Foliage in autumn just before shedding]]\nBald cypress is [[Monoecious#Plant population|monoecious]]. Male and female strobili mature in one growing season from buds formed the previous year. The male catkins are about {{convert|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and are borne in slender, purplish, drooping clusters {{convert|7|to|13|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long that are conspicuous during the winter on this deciduous conifer. Pollen is shed in March and April. Female conelets are found singly or in clusters of two or three. The globose cones turn from green to brownish-purple as they mature from October to December. The cones are {{convert|13|to|36|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and consist of 9 to 15 four-sided scales that break away irregularly after maturity. Each scale can bear two irregular, triangular seeds with thick, horny, warty coats and projecting flanges.<ref>Faulkner, Stephen P. 1982.

Personal communication. National Audubon Society, Francis Beidler Forest, Harleyville, SC.</ref> Floodwaters spread the scales or cones along streams and are the most important means of seed dissemination.<ref name=\"Agriculture, Forest Service 1965\"/>\n\n===Seedling development===\n[[Germination]] is [[epigeal germination|epigeal]].<ref name=\"Agriculture, Forest Service 1974\"/> Under swamp conditions, germination generally takes place on a sphagnum moss or a wet-muck seedbed. Seeds will not germinate under water, but some will remain viable for 30 months under water. On the other hand, seeds usually fail to germinate on better drained soils because of the lack of surface water. Thus, a soil saturated but not flooded for a period of one to three months after seedfall is required for germination.<ref name=\"Agriculture, Forest Service 1965\"/>\n\n[[File:Bald Cypress swamp and Spanish Moss.jpg|thumb|left|Bald cypress swamp and Spanish moss at First Landing State Park in Virginia Beach, VA]]After germination, seedlings must grow fast enough to keep at least part of their crowns above floodwaters for most of the growing season.<ref>Conner, William H, 1988, Natural and artificial regeneration of baldcypress [Taxodium distichum (L.)

Nursery beds are sown in spring with pretreated seeds or in fall with untreated seeds. Seedlings usually reach {{convert|75|to|100|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in height during their first (and usually only) year in the nursery. Average size of 1-0 nursery-grown seedlings in a seed source test including 72 families was {{convert|81.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|1.1|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.\n\nControl of competing vegetation may be necessary for a year or more for bald cypress planted outside of swamps. Five years after planting on a harrowed and bedded, poorly drained site in Florida, survival was high, but heights had increased only {{convert|30|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}, probably because of heavy herbaceous competition. Seedlings grown in a crawfish pond in Louisiana, where weed control and soil moisture were excellent through June, averaged {{convert|2.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|3.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter at breast height (DBH) after five years. However, a replicate of the same sources planted on an old soybean field, where weed control and soil moisture were poor, resulted in the same DBH, but a smaller average seedling height of {{convert|2.1|m|ft|abbr=on}}<!-- (John R. Toliver, unpublished data)-->. When planted in a residential yard and weeded and watered, they averaged {{convert|3.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall three years later.\n\n===Vegetative reproduction===\n\nBald cypress is one of the few conifer species that sprouts. Thrifty sprouts are generally produced from stumps of young trees, but trees up to 60 years old also send up healthy sprouts if the trees are cut during the fall or winter. However, survival of these sprouts is often poor and those that live are usually poorly shaped and do not make quality sawtimber trees. Stumps of trees up to 200 years old may also sprout, but the sprouts are not as vigorous and are more subject to wind damage as the stump decays. In the only report on the rooting of bald cypress cuttings found in the literature, cuttings from trees five years old rooted better than those from older trees.\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Bald cypress Atchafalaya Basin.jpg|left|thumb|125px|A bald cypress in the Atchafalaya Basin of Louisiana]]\n[[File:Bald cypress knees in duckweed.JPG|thumb|left|125px|Bald cypress knees in [[duckweed]]]]\nThe seeds remain viable for less than one year, and are dispersed in two ways. One is by water; the seeds float and move on water until flooding recedes or the cone is deposited on shore. The second is by wildlife; [[squirrel]]s eat seeds, but often drop some scales from the cones they harvest. Seeds do not germinate under water and rarely germinate on well-drained soils; seedlings normally become established on continuously saturated, but not flooded, soils for one to three months. After germination, seedlings must grow quickly to escape floodwaters; they often reach a height of 20\u201375&nbsp;cm (up to 100&nbsp;cm in fertilized [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery]] conditions) in their first year. Seedlings die if inundated for more than about two to four weeks. Natural regeneration is therefore prevented on sites that are always flooded during the growing season. Although vigorous saplings and stump sprouts can produce viable seed, most specimens do not produce seed until they are about 30 years old. In good conditions, Bald-cypress grows fairly fast when young, then more slowly with age. Trees have been measured to reach 3 m in five years, 21 m in 41 years, and 36 m in height in 96 years; height growth has largely ceased by the time the trees are 200 years old. Some individuals can live over 1,000 years. Determination of the age of an old tree may be difficult because of frequent missing or false [[growth ring|ring]]s of stemwood caused by variable and stressful growing environments.\n\n[[File:Cypress 8001.JPG|thumb|Bald cypress forest in winter, showing \"knees\" and (brown) high flood level, Lynches River, [[Johnsonville, South Carolina]]]]\nBald cypress trees growing in swamps have a peculiarity of growth called [[cypress knee]]s. These are woody projections from the root system project above the ground or water. Their function was once thought to be to provide [[oxygen]] to the roots, which grow in the low dissolved oxygen (DO) waters typical of a swamp (as in [[mangrove]]s). However, evidence for this is scant; in fact, roots of swamp-dwelling specimens whose knees are removed do not decrease in oxygen content and the trees continue to thrive. Another more likely function is structural support and stabilization. Bald cypress trees growing on flood-prone sites tend to form buttressed bases, but trees grown on drier sites may lack this feature. Buttressed bases and a strong, intertwined root system allow them to resist very strong winds; even [[hurricane]]s rarely overturn them.<ref name=usfs>U.S. Forest Service Silvics Manual: [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/Volume_1/taxodium/distichum.htm ''Taxodium distichum'']</ref>\n\nMany agents damage ''T. distichum'' trees. The main damaging (in some cases lethal) agent is the [[fungus]] ''Stereum taxodii'', which causes a brown pocket rot known as \"pecky cypress\". It attacks the heartwood of living trees, usually from the crown down to the roots. A few other fungi attack the sapwood and the heartwood of the tree, but they do not usually cause serious damage. [[Insect]]s such as the cypress flea beetle (''Systena marginalis'') and the bald cypress leafroller (''Archips goyerana'') (closely related to the [[Archips argyrospila|fruit tree leafroller]]) can seriously damage trees by destroying leaves, cones or the bark. [[Coypu|Nutrias]] also clip and unroot young bald cypress seedlings, sometimes killing a whole plantation in a short amount of time.<ref name=usfs/>\n\n==Conservation==\nIn 2002, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources identified ''T distichum'' as a state protected plant with the status of Threatened.\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[File:Taxodium distichum02.jpg|thumb|right|<center>Timber]]\nThis species is a popular [[ornamental tree]], grown for its light, feathery foliage and orange-brown to dull red fall color. In cultivation, it thrives on a wide range of soils, including well-drained sites where it would not grow naturally due to the inability of the young seedlings to compete with other vegetation. Cultivation is successful far to the north of its native range, north to southern Canada. It is also commonly planted in Europe, Asia and elsewhere with [[temperateness|temperate]] to [[subtropical]] climates. It does, however, require hot summers for good growth; when planted in areas with cool summers [[oceanic climate]]s, growth is healthy but very slow (some in northeastern England have only reached 4\u20135 m tall in about 50 years),<ref>Tree Register of the British Isles</ref> and cones are not produced.\n\nOne of the oldest in Europe, was planted in the 1900s in the [[Arboretum de P\u00e9zanin]], Burgundy, France.\n\nBald cypress has been noted for its high merchantable yields. In virgin stands, yields from 112 to 196 m\u00b3/ha were common, and some stands might have exceeded 1000 m\u00b3/ha. Bald cypress swamps are some of the world's most productive ecosystems.\n\nThe odorless wood of bald cypress, closely resembling that of ''[[Cupressus]]'' spp., has long been valued for its water resistance, thus is called 'wood eternal'. Still-usable prehistoric wood is often found in swamps as far north as New Jersey, and occasionally as far as Connecticut, although it is more common in the southeast. The somewhat-mineralized wood is mined from some swamps in the southeast, and is highly prized for specialty uses such as wood carvings. Pecky cypress, caused by the fungus ''Stereum taxodii'' is used for decorative wall [[paneling]].\n\nThe bald cypress was designated the official [[list of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[Louisiana]] in 1963.<ref>{{cite book|title=Louisiana Almanac, 2006-2007|page=431|last1=Calhoun|first1=Milburn|last2=Frois|first2=Jeanne|isbn=978-1-58980-307-7|publisher=Pelican Publishing|edition=17th|date=31 May 2006}}</ref>  It is considered by some to be a symbol of the southern swamps.\n\nCypress trees can be used in the making of shingles. [[Joshua Brown (Texas pioneer)|Joshua D. Brown]], the first settler of [[Kerrville, Texas|Kerrville]], [[Texas]], made his living producing shingles from cypress trees growing along the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] of the [[Texas Hill Country]].<ref>Historical marker, Texas Historical Commission, [[Kerrville, Texas|Kerrville]], [[Texas]], 1971</ref> Shingles produced from cypress were also one of the main industries for early pioneers in Kissimmee, Florida (near Walt Disney World). One of the main bodies of water in the area, Shingle Creek, is named in homage of their importance to the growth of the city.<ref>http://osceola.ifas.ufl.edu/pdfs/Natural%20Resources/Shingle%20Creek_Brochure_2013_final.pdf</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Taxodium distichum|<br/>Taxodium distichum}}\n{{wikispecies}}\n* [https://cypress.uark.edu/ The Ancient Bald Cypress Consortium]\n* [http://www.monumentaltrees.com/en/trees/baldcypress/deep_south/ Images of bald-cypress trees and swamps]\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/taxodium-distichum-baldcypress-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map for Taxodium distichum]\n* [http://www.monumentaltrees.com/en/photos-baldcypress/ Photos of remarkable bald-cypress trees worldwide]\n* [http://www.euforgen.org/species/taxodium-distichum/ ''Taxodium distichum''] - information, genetic conservation units and related resources.

Individuals typically occur in clumps and are multi-stemmed with varying stem densities . It is [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], with the male and female [[conifer cone|cones]] on separate plants; the [[seed]] cone is highly modified, [[Berry (botany)#Berry-like conifer seed cones|berry-like]], with a single scale developing into a soft, juicy red [[aril]] 1&nbsp;cm diameter, containing a single dark brown seed 5\u20136&nbsp;mm long and occur singly on few leaf axils.

There are isolated populations in west-central Manitoba, and to the south in [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[Ohio]], and [[Illinois]] and in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], and [[West Virginia]].<ref name=\"conifers.org\" /> In Canada, its range reaches the [[Arctic treeline]] and the southern tip of [[Hudson Bay]]. It grows mainly in places with cooler summers, with an average of {{convert|16|to|22|C|F}} in July, and a shorter growing season, from 90 to 180 days.<ref name=\"silvics\" />\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Superior Hiking Trail boardwalk.jpg|thumb|A swamp along the [[Superior Hiking Trail]] in November with white-cedars (left) and other trees and shrubs]]\nNorthern white-cedar grows naturally in wet forests, being particularly abundant in [[coniferous swamp]]s where other larger and faster-growing trees cannot compete successfully. It also occurs on other sites with reduced tree competition, such as [[cliffs]]. Although not currently listed as endangered, wild white-cedar populations are threatened in many areas by high [[deer]] numbers; deer find the soft evergreen foliage a very attractive winter food, and strip it rapidly. The largest known specimen is {{convert|34|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|175|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter, on [[South Manitou Island]] within [[Leelanau County, Michigan]].\n\nNorthern white-cedar can be a very long-lived tree in certain conditions, with notably old specimens growing on cliffs where they are inaccessible to deer and [[wildfire]]; the oldest known living specimen is{{when|date=August 2016}} just over 1,100 years old, but a dead specimen with over 1,650 growth rings has been found.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.eku.edu/pedersonn/oldlisteast/Spp/THOC.html|year=2008|accessdate=22 August 2013|title=Eastern OLDLIST a database of ancient trees and their ages|publisher=Rocky Mountain Tree-Ring Research, Inc. & Eastern Kentucky University}}</ref> Despite their age, these very old trees are small and stunted due to the difficult growing conditions.

The [[Bucculatricidae|ribbed cocoon maker]] species ''[[Bucculatrix improvisa]]'' has not been found on other plants.\n\nThis species is particularly susceptible to adult [[Japanese beetle]]s (an [[invasive species]] in North America) that feed on its leaves.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=USDA |title=Managing the Japanese Beetle:A Homeowner\u2019s Handbook |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/plant_health/content/printable_version/JB3-07.indd.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Cultivation and uses ==\n[[File:Tilia americana sections.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Sections of ''Tilia americana'' from ''[[The American Woods]]'']]\nThe American basswood can be propagated by cuttings and grafting as well as by seed.  The plants grow rapidly in a rich soil, but are subject to the attacks of many insect enemies.\n\nThe American basswood is known for being one of the most difficult native North American trees to propagate from seed, as they not only have a low viability rate (approximately 30% of all seeds are viable), but quickly develop an extremely hard seed coating that may delay germination for up to two years. If planting them, it is recommended to gather the seeds in early autumn and sow them before they dry out and form a coating. This will then allow germination to occur immediately. Overall, seeds are not a major part of the tree's reproductive strategy and it instead mostly spreads by self-coppicing. All juvenile basswoods [[coppice]] extremely readily, and even old trees will often sprout from the stump if cut.\n\nThe American basswood is recommended as an ornamental tree when the mass of foliage or a deep shade is desired; no native tree surpasses it in this respect. It is often planted on the windward side of an orchard as a protection to young and delicate trees.<ref name=Keeler /> It is cultivated at least as far north as [[Juneau, Alaska]].<ref>Juneau: [http://www.silverbowinn.com/downtown_tree_guide%20final%2006.pdf Downtown Juneau Tree Guide] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818004459/http://www.silverbowinn.com/downtown_tree_guide%20final%2006.pdf |date=August 18, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe foliage and flowers are both edible, though many prefer only to eat the tender young leaves. It is a beneficial species for attracting pollinators as well. Bees produce excellent honey with a mildly spicy flavor from its blossoms.\n\n[[Cultivar]]s include 'Nova', 'Duros' (with an upright crown), the pyramidal 'Frontyard' and the conic-crowned 'Redmond'.\n\n=== Wood ===\n[[File:Natural Basswood Cat Statuette.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|basswood carving]]\nThe wood is pale brown, sometimes nearly white or faintly tinged with red; light, soft with fine close grain; clear of knots but does not split easily. It is low in strength and has a poor steam-bending classification. It can take stains and polish without difficulty and it planes, glues, screws and nails well.<ref>{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Terry |date=2006 |title=Wood Identification & Use \u2013 Revised & Expanded |page=254}}</ref> It is sold generally under the name basswood, but is sometimes confounded with tulip-wood and then called white-wood, and is largely used in the manufacture of wooden-ware, wagon boxes and furniture. It has a [[density]] of 0.4525. The wood is considered odorless. This makes it valuable in the manufacture of wooden-ware, cheap furniture, bodies of carriages; it is also especially adapted for wood-carving. The inner bark is very tough and fibrous, used in the past for making ropes.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nIt is a common wood for use in the production of solid body electric guitars, where it is considered an analogue for aspen and poplar, because it is light, strong and resonant, though it is usually used for guitars that will be painted an opaque color, because its lack of notable grain makes it an unattractive candidate for transparent finish. Linden wood rots easily and old trees have many cavities that serve as nesting places for birds.\n\n=== Medicinal uses ===\nAlthough ''[[Tilia cordata]]'' is believed to be stronger, ''T. americana'' is also used medicinally. The dried flowers are mildly sweet and sticky, and the fruit is somewhat sweet and mucilaginous. Linden tea has a pleasing taste, due to the aromatic volatile oil found in the flowers. The flowers, leaves, wood, and charcoal (obtained from the wood) are used for medicinal purposes. Active ingredients in the linden flowers include [[flavonoid]]s (which act as [[antioxidant]]s), volatile oils, and mucilaginous constituents (which soothe and reduce inflammation). The plant also contains [[tannin]]s that can act as an [[astringent]].<ref name=bradley>{{citation |editor-first=Bradley |editor-last=P |encyclopedia=British Herbal Compendium |volume=I |place=Dorset (Great Britain |publisher=British Herbal Medicine Association |date=1992 |pages=142\u2013144}}</ref>\n\nLinden flowers are used in colds, cough, fever, infections, inflammation, high blood pressure, headache (particularly migraine), as a diuretic (increases urine production), antispasmodic (reduces smooth muscle spasm along the digestive tract), and sedative. The flowers were added to baths to quell hysteria, and steeped as a tea to relieve anxiety-related indigestion, irregular heartbeat, and vomiting. The leaves are used to promote sweating to reduce fevers. The wood is used for liver and gallbladder disorders and cellulitis (inflammation of the skin and surrounding soft tissue). That wood burned to charcoal is ingested to treat intestinal disorders and used topically to treat edema or infection, such as cellulitis or ulcers of the lower leg.<ref name=bradley /><ref name=\"mice\"/>\n\nSeveral animal studies showed that the extract of ''T. americana'' increased sleeping time with 50 minutes (similar to the effects of [[diazepam]]) and decreased movement, which indicates sedative effects.<ref name=\"mice\">{{Cite journal|last=Aguirre-Hern\u00e1ndez|first=E.|last2=Mart\u00ednez|first2=A.

The leaves and cones have a strongly pungent resinous odor when crushed, leading to its popular names \"stinking yew\" and \"stinking cedar\".\n\n==Distribution==\n''Torreya taxifolia'' is restricted to [[limestone]] bluffs and their [[ravine]]s within [[Torreya State Park]] and at the [[Nature Conservancy]] Apalachicola Bluffs and Ravines Preserve, along the east bank of the [[Apalachicola River]] in the northern [[Florida Panhandle]] and immediately adjacent southernmost [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

''L. nigrinus'', which is native to the Pacific Northwest, naturally preys on the hemlock wooly adelgid. The particular site near Lansing was chosen because its hemlocks are only lightly infested with the woolly adelgid, and there are enough trees to sustain a long-term study. The site will be left untreated with pesticides for 10 years to study how well the ''L. nigrinus'' beetles become established; if the experiment proves successful, researchers expect the population will take two to three years to build to levels where they can be readily detected.<ref name=scidaily111909>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091113124302.htm Predator Beetle to Battle Hemlock Pest]</ref>\n\n== Paleoecology ==\nThe mid-[[Holocene]] decline of hemlock populations is a much-studied phenomenon.<ref name=Oswald>{{cite journal|last=Oswald|first=W.

The eastern hemlock increased again after the major decline, but did not recover its former place as a dominant species.\n\n== Exceptional trees ==\nDue to its being a long-lived tree, several very large or otherwise impressive trees exist along the east coast of North America. One organization, the [[Eastern Native Tree Society]] (ENTS), has been particularly active in discovering and measuring these trees. In the southern Appalachians, many individuals reach {{convert|45|m}} tall, and one tree has been measured in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to {{convert|52.8|m|ftin}} tall, though this tree is now dead from hemlock woolly adelgid; the tallest now surviving, the \"Noland Mountain tree\", is {{convert|51.8|m|ftin}} tall.<ref name=gd /> Altogether, ENTS has confirmed four trees to heights of {{convert|51|m}} or more by climb and tape drop. In the Northeast, the tallest accurately measured tree is {{convert|44|m}}. This tree, named the Seneca hemlock, grows in Cook Forest State Park, PA. Above 43\u00b0N latitude, the maximum height of the species is less, under {{convert|39|m}}. In New England, ENTS has measured hemlocks to {{convert|42|m}}, although trees above 39&nbsp;m are extremely rare in New England. By 44\u00b0N, the maximum height is probably not more than {{convert|35|m}}.\nDiameters of mature hemlocks range from {{convert|0.75|\u2013|1.8|m|ftin}}, with trees over {{convert|1.6|m|ftin}} diameter being very rare. In New England, the maximum diameter is {{convert|1.4|m|ftin}}.\n\nTrunk volume is the third dimension to receive attention by ENTS. Many eastern hemlocks have been modeled to over 30&nbsp;m\u00b3 trunk volume, and the largest has been calculated to be 44.8 m\u00b3,<ref name=gd>Gymnosperm Database: [http://www.conifers.org/pi/Tsuga_canadensis.php ''Tsuga canadensis'']</ref> making it the largest natural evergreen conifer in the eastern United States. The center of maximum size development for the species is the southern Appalachians, especially the Great Smoky Mountains.\n\n== Cultivation ==\n''Tsuga canadensis'' has long been a popular tree in cultivation. The tree's preference for partial shade and tolerance of full shade allows it to be planted in areas where other conifers would not easily grow. In addition, its very fine-textured foliage that droops to the ground, its pyramidal growth habit and its ability to withstand hard pruning make it a desirable [[ornamental plant|ornamental tree]]. In cultivation, it prefers sites that are slightly acidic to neutral with nutrient-rich and moist but well-drained soil. It is most often used as a specimen, for a screen, or in small group plantings, though it can also be trained as a dense formal hedge. It should not be used on roadsides where salt is used in winter, as its foliage is sensitive to salt spray. It is also poorly adapted as a windbreak tree, as wind exposure causes dieback in winter. It has several drawbacks, such as a fairly low tolerance of urban stress, intolerance for very wet or very dry soils, and susceptibility to attack by the hemlock woolly adelgid, though this is treatable.<ref name=UConn /> Its tendency to shed needles rapidly after being cut down renders it unsuitable as a [[Christmas tree]].\n\nIt was introduced to British gardens in 1736.<ref name=afm>Mitchell, A. F. (1974). ''A Field Guide to the Trees of Britain and Northern Europe''. Collins ISBN 0-00-212035-6</ref> In the [[UK]], it is encountered frequently in gardens both large and small, as well as some parks, and is most common in the eastern areas of the country. It is sometimes employed as a [[hedge (barrier)|hedge]], but is considered inferior for this usage compared to ''[[Tsuga heterophylla]]'' (western hemlock); it is not well adapted to the UK climate and as a consequence often has a poorly developed, forked and sinuous trunk there.<ref name=afm /><ref name=afm2>Mitchell, A.

The species is tolerant of a wide range of soils, and of ponding, but is the least shade-tolerant of the North American elms. Its growth rate is often very slow, the trunk increasing in diameter by less than {{convert|5|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} per year. The tree is occasionally considered a nuisance as it readily invades old fields, forest clearings, and rangelands, proving particularly difficult to eradicate with herbicides.<ref name=University>University of Florida, Environmental Horticulture Department (1994).

The American elm is an extremely hardy tree that can withstand winter temperatures as low as \u221242 \u00b0[[Celsius|C]] (\u221244 \u00b0[[Fahrenheit|F]]). Trees in areas unaffected by [[Dutch elm disease]] can live for several hundred years. A prime example of the species was the Sauble Elm,<ref>'Lord of the Elms', [http://web.archive.org/web/20110711013315/http://www.flyingsquirrels.com/sauble_elm/ web.archive.org/web/20110711013315/http://www.flyingsquirrels.com/sauble_elm/]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmitsburg.net/nfs/articles/re/2008/elms.htm|title=Of Elms and Orioles|publisher=Emmitsburg News-Journal: The New Forest Society|accessdate=December 15, 2014}}</ref> which grew beside the banks of the [[Sauble River (Ontario)|Sauble River]] in [[Ontario]], Canada, to a height of 43&nbsp;m (140&nbsp;ft), with a [[diameter at breast height|d.b.h]] of 196&nbsp;cm (6.43&nbsp;ft) before succumbing to Dutch elm disease;  when it was felled in 1968, a tree-ring count established that it had germinated in 1701. \n\nFor over 80 years, ''U. americana'' has been identified as a [[tetraploid]], i.e. having double the usual number of chromosomes, making it unique within the genus. However, a study published in 2011 by the [[Agricultural Research Service]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] revealed that about 20% of wild American elms are [[diploid]], and may even constitute another species. Moreover, several triploid trees known only in cultivation, such as [[Ulmus americana 'Jefferson'|'Jefferson']], are possessed of a high degree of resistance to [[Dutch elm disease]] which ravaged American elms in the 20th century. This suggests that the diploid parent trees, which have markedly smaller cells than the tetraploid, may too be highly resistant to the disease.<ref name=Whittemore>Whittemore, A. & Olsen, R. (2011).

The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, 7&ndash;20&nbsp;cm long, with double-serrate margins and an oblique base. The [[perfect flower]]s are small, purple-brown and, being wind-pollinated, [[apetalous]]. The flowers are also [[protogynous]], the female parts maturing before the male, thus reducing, but not eliminating, self-fertilization,<ref name=\"Hans\">{{cite journal|last=Hans|first=A.

However, the condition is far less serious, and afflicted trees should recover the following year.\n\n===Dutch elm disease===\n{{Main article|Dutch elm disease}}\nDutch elm disease (DED) is a [[fungus|fungal]] [[disease]] which has ravaged the American elm, causing catastrophic die-offs in cities across the range. It has been estimated that only approximately 1 in 100,000 American elm trees is DED-tolerant, most known survivors simply having escaped exposure to the disease.<ref name=\"DEDresistance\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jul96/elms0796.htm|title=New American Elms Restore Stately Trees|publisher=Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture|date=July 1996|accessdate=December 18, 2014}}</ref> However, in some areas still not populated by Dutch elm disease, the American elm continues to thrive, notably in [[Florida]], [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]].\n\nThe American elm is particularly susceptible to disease because the period of infection often coincides with the period, approximately 30 days, of rapid terminal growth when new springwood vessels are fully functional. Spores introduced outside of this period remain largely static within the [[xylem]] and are thus relatively ineffective.<ref name=Smalley>{{cite journal|last=Smalley|first=E. G.|year=1963|title=Seasonal Fluctuations in Susceptibility of Young Elm Seedlings to Dutch Elm Disease|journal=Phytopathology|volume=53|issue=7|pages= 846\u2013853}}</ref>\n\nThe American elm's biology in some ways has helped to spare it from obliteration by the Dutch elm disease, in contrast to what happened to the [[American chestnut]] with the [[chestnut blight]]. The elm's seeds are largely wind-dispersed, and the tree grows quickly and begins bearing seeds at a young age. It grows well along roads or railroad tracks, and in abandoned lots and other disturbed areas, where it is highly tolerant of most stress factors. Elms have been able to survive and to reproduce in areas where the disease had eliminated old trees, although most of these young elms eventually succumb to the disease at a relatively young age. There is some reason to hope that these elms will preserve the genetic diversity of the original population, and that they eventually will hybridize with DED-resistant varieties that have been developed or that occur naturally. After 20 years of research, American scientists first developed DED-resistant strains of elms in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"DEDresistance\" />\n\nFungicidal injections can be administered to valuable American elms, to prevent infection. Such injections generally are effective as a preventive measure for up to three years when performed before any symptoms have appeared, but may be ineffective once the disease is evident.\n\n==Cultivation==\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, American elm was a common street and park tree owing to its tolerance of urban conditions, rapid growth, and graceful form. This however led to extreme overplanting of the species, especially to form living archways over streets, which ultimately produced an unhealthy [[monoculture]] of elms that had no resistance to disease and pests.<ref name=\"Stennes\">{{cite journal| last=Stennes | first=Mark | year=2003 | title=Good News for the American Elm | journal=Shade Tree Advocate | volume=5 | issue=4 | page=6 |accessdate=December 19, 2014}}</ref> These trees' rapid growth and longevity, leading to great size within decades, also favored its horticultural use before the advent of Dutch elm disease.<ref Name=Werthner/> Ohio botanist William B. Werthner, discussing the contrast between open-grown and forest-grown American elms, noted that:  \n<blockquote>\nIn the open, with an abundance of air and light, the main trunk divides into several leading branches which leave the trunk at a sharp angle and continue to grow upward, gradually diverging, dividing and subdividing into long, flexible branchlets whose ends, at last, float lightly in the air, giving the tree a round, somewhat flattened top of beautifully regular proportions and characteristically fine twiggery.<ref name=Werthner />\n</blockquote>\n\nIt is this distinctive growth form that is so valued in the open-grown American elms of street plantings, lawns, and parks; along most narrower streets, elms planted on opposite sides arch and blend together into a leafy canopy over the pavement. However, elms can assume many different sizes and forms depending on the location and climate zone, and the classic vase-like shape is far from the norm in naturally occurring (as opposed to cultivated) specimens.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"px\" heights=\"px\">\nFile:NIE 1905 Elm.jpg|Early photos of New England American elms, showing growth patterns, ''The New International Encyclop\u00e6dia'' (1905).\nFile:Lafayette Street, Salem, MA.jpg|Lafayette Street, Salem, MA.: 'high-tunnel effect' of ''U. americana'' avenues once common in New England.\nFile:American Elm, Western Massachusetts - September 2016.jpg|Surviving American elm \"street tree\" in western Massachusetts (2016).\nFile:PSM V78 D424 An old cambridge landmark.png|''Ulmus americana'' as campus elm: Cambridge, Massachusetts\nFile:Massachusetts American Elm 1 - May 2012.jpg|American elm, Massachusetts (2012).

The tree typically grows well in flat valley bottom areas referred to as 'Cedar Elm Flats'. The common name 'cedar elm' is derived from the trees' association with [[juniper]] trees, locally known as cedars.<ref>http://npsot.org/wp/story/2011/1687/</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe cedar elm is a medium to large [[deciduous]] [[tree]] growing to 24&ndash;27&nbsp;m tall with a rounded crown. The [[leaf|leaves]] are small, 2.5&ndash;5&nbsp;cm long by 1.3&ndash;2&nbsp;cm broad, with an oblique base, and distinguish it from ''[[Ulmus serotina]]'' with which it readily hybridizes in the wild. Leaf fall is late, often in early winter. The wind-pollinated [[apetalous]] [[perfect flower]]s are produced in the late summer or early fall; they are small and inconspicuous, with a reddish-purple color. The [[fruit]] is a small winged [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] 8&ndash;10&nbsp;mm long, maturing quickly after the flowering in late fall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233501326 |title=Ulmus crassifolia in Flora of North America @ |publisher=Efloras.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ulcr |title=Plants Profile for Ulmus crassifolia (cedar elm) |publisher=Plants.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}</ref>\n<gallery>\nImage:Ulmus crassifolia (USDA).jpg|thumb|left|''U. crassifolia'' bark\nFile:MonarchButterfly-5635.jpg|Migrating [[monarch butterflies]] on a cedar elm in central Texas\n</gallery>\n\n==Pests and diseases==\nCedar elm is susceptible to [[Dutch elm disease]] (DED), though less so than [[American elm]], and moderately damaged by the elm leaf beetle ''[[Xanthogaleruca luteola]]''. The tree also suffers from a vascular wilt, the symptoms often confused with those of DED.\n\nCedar elms are very susceptible to [[Phoradendron tomentosum|mistletoe]].  Mistletoe is a parasite that roots itself in to the vascular system of the tree, thus stealing valuable nutrients and water.  In some cases, if not removed the parasite can be devastating to large sections of trees and even fatal.  They create club like branches that die out at the ends.  These \"club\" branches create openings for future pests like the elm beetles and carpenter ants.  There are no known treatments that are safe enough to kill mistletoe without killing the tree.  Removing the mistletoe manually is not a guarantee, however it is the best known method for control.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n==Cultivation==\nOwing to Dutch elm disease, the cedar elm is now rarely cultivated in North America.

It is also very strong and takes a high polish, and consequently was once in great demand in America and Europe for a wide range of uses, notably [[shipbuilding]], [[furniture]], [[agriculture|agricultural tools]], and [[musical instrument]]s.\n\nMuch of the timber's strength is derived from the tight grain arising from the tree's very slow rate of growth, the trunk typically increasing in diameter by up to {{convert|2|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} a year. Over 250 annual growth rings were once counted in a log {{convert|24|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} square being sawn for [[gunwale]]s in an English boatyard, while a tree once grown at [[Kew Gardens]], [[London]], attained a height of only {{convert|12|m|ft|abbr=on}} in 50 years.<ref name=Elwes>Elwes, H.

The flowers are borne in flat-topped cymes 10&nbsp;cm in diameter in mid to late spring. The [[fruit]] is a [[drupe]] 1&nbsp;cm long, dark blue-black with glaucous bloom, hangs until winter, becomes edible after being frosted, then eaten by birds; the stone is flat and even, broadly oval. Wherever it lives, black haw prefers sunny [[woodland]] with well-drained soil and adequate water.<ref name=missouriplants/><ref name=encyclopedia/><ref name=Keeler/><ref name=Castleman/>\n\n==Uses==\nIt has both value in the pleasure garden, providing good fall color and early winter provender for birds, and medicinal properties.\n\nIt has [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridized]] with ''[[Viburnum lentago]]'' in cultivation to give the garden hybrid [[Viburnum \u00d7 jackii|''Viburnum'' \u00d7 ''jackii'']].\n\nThe [[wood]] is brown tinged with red; heavy, hard, close-grained with a density of 0.8332.<ref name=Keeler/>\n\n===Medicinal uses===\nFor centuries, black haw has been used for medical purposes, mainly for [[gynecology|gynecological]] conditions. The bark is the part of the plant used in treatments.<ref name=encyclopedia/>\n\nThe active components include [[scopoletin]], [[aesculetin]], [[salicin]], [[1-methyl-2,3 clibutyl hemimellitate]], and [[viburnin]]. [[Tannin]] is another chemical component of black haw.<ref name=encyclopedia/>\n\n[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] used a [[decoction]] of black haw to treat gynecological conditions, including menstrual cramps, aiding recovery after [[childbirth]], and in treating the effects of menopause.<ref name=Castleman/> As a folk remedy, black haw has been used to treat menstrual pain, and [[morning sickness]]. Due to its antispasmodic properties, the plant may also be of use in treating cramps of the digestive tract or the bile ducts.<ref name=encyclopedia/>\n\nBlack haw's primary use was to prevent [[miscarriage]]s.<ref name=encyclopedia/> [[Slavery in the United States|American slaveholders]] also used the plant to prevent [[abortion]]s. [[Slave]]s were a valuable asset, and their owner also owned their offspring, so ensuring that female slaves gave birth was of paramount importance. In defiance, some slave women would attempt to use [[cotton]] seeds to cause a miscarriage. The slaveowners would therefore force pregnant slaves to drink an infusion of black haw to prevent that.<ref name=Castleman/> Incorrect - they used the bark from the root of the cotton plant to induce abortion.\n\nThe primary use of black haw today is to prevent menstrual cramps. The salicin in black haw may also be of use in pain relief.<ref name=Castleman/>\n\n===Safety issues===\nLike many other plants, including many food plants and those used as culinary herbs, black haw contains [[salicin]], a chemical relative of [[aspirin]]. Those who are [[allergy|allergic]] to that substance should not use black haw.<ref name=encyclopedia/> In addition, due to the connection between aspirin and [[Reye syndrome]], young people or people afflicted with a [[virus|viral disease]] should not use black haw.\n\nThe chemicals in black haw do relax the uterus and therefore probably prevent miscarriage; however, the salicin may be [[Teratology|teratogenic]]. Consequently, pregnant women should not use black haw in the first two trimesters.<ref name=Castleman/> Furthermore, anyone using herbs for medical reasons should only use them under the supervision of a qualified medical professional.\n\nBlack haw is not on the \"generally recognized as safe list\" of the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).<ref name=FDA>{{cite web|title=SUBSTANCES GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS SAFE|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|work=Code of Federal Regulations - Title 21, Volume 6|date=2006-04-01|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=582&showFR=1|accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{commonscat|Viburnum prunifolium|position=left}}\n\n\n\n[[Category:Viburnum|prunifolium]]\n[[Category:Flora of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Plants used in traditional Native American medicine]]",
