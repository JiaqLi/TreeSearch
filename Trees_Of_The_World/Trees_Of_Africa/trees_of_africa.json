It can potentially be dispersed over long distances, and its germination potential is improved when it has passed through the digestive tract of an animal. Animals like [[African bush elephant|elephants]], [[black rhino]]s and [[Taurotragus|eland]] can potentially convey the seeds over long distances. [[Baboons]] likewise spread the seeds in their dung, but over shorter distances.<ref name=braam/>\n\nPollination in the baobab is achieved primarily by [[fruit bat]]s, but [[Galago|bush babies]] and several kinds of insect also assist. Some aspects of the baobab's reproductive biology are not yet understood. It is still speculated whether fertile baobab seeds can result from pollination by the tree's own pollen. It would appear as if pollen from another tree is required for fertile seed, as isolated trees do form seed, only to abort them at a late stage. The existence of some very isolated trees, may then be due to their [[Self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatibility]] and inability to reproduce.<ref name=braam/>\n\nArab traders introduced it to northwestern [[Madagascar]].

The gods became angry and uprooted them and threw them back into the ground upside-down. Evil spirits now cause bad luck to anyone that picks up the sweet white flowers. More specifically, a lion will kill them.<ref name=\"krugerpark.co.za\"/>\n\nIn contrast, some people {{by whom|date=January 2017}} think that if one drinks from water in which baobab seeds have soaked, you will be safe from crocodile attacks.\n\nIn [[Zambia]], one baobab is said to be haunted by a ghostly [[Pythonidae|python]]. A long time ago, the python lived in the hollow trunk and was worshipped by the natives. A white hunter shot him down, and led to bad consequences. Some nights, the natives still hear the hissing of the snake.<ref name=\"krugerpark.co.za\"/>\n\nIn [[Kafue National Park]], one of the largest baobabs is known as \u201cKondanamwali\u201d or the \u201ctree that eats maidens.\u201d The tree fell in love with four beautiful maidens. When they reached puberty, they made the tree jealous by finding husbands. So, one night, during a thunderstorm, the tree opened its trunk and took the maidens inside.  Interestingly enough, a rest house has been built in the branches of the tree. On stormy nights, the crying of the imprisoned maidens can still be heard.<ref name=\"krugerpark.co.za\"/>\n\nAlong the [[Limpopo River]], it is thought that when a young boy is bathed in the water used to soak baobab bark, he will grow up into a big man.<ref name=\"krugerpark.co.za\"/>\n\nSome people believe that women living in [[kraal]]s where baobabs are plenty will have more children. This is scientifically plausible as those women will have better access to the tree's vitamin-rich leaves and fruits to compliment a vitamin-deficient diet.<ref name=\"krugerpark.co.za\"/>\n\nThe African bushman legend states that Thora, the god, took a dislike to the baobab growing in his garden. Therefore, he threw it over the wall of Paradise onto the Earth below. The tree landed upside down and continued to grow.<ref name=\"krugerpark.co.za\"/>\n\n==Conservation status and threats== \nAs of April 2015 baobabs are not yet classified by the [[IUCN]]'s Red List criteria, but they are a part of the \u201cCatalogue of Life.\u201d<ref name=\"catalogueoflife.org\"/> The species is [[extant taxon|extant]] over a wide range.<ref name=\"eol.org\"/> The baobab is a protected tree in [[South Africa]].<ref name=\"dwaf\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.dwaf.gov.za/dwaf/cmsdocs/4116___poster%20protected%20trees.pdf |title=Protected Trees |date=3 May 2013 |publisher=Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, Republic of South Africa}}</ref> In the [[Sahel]], the effects of drought, [[desertification]] and over-use of the fruit have been cited as causes for concern.<ref name=osman>{{cite web |last1=Osman |first1=Siham M. |title=Save the Baobab |url=http://practicalaction.org/baobab |website=practicalaction.org |publisher=ITDG Practical Action Sudan | date = 2014 |accessdate=6 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Prominent specimens ==\n{{GeoGroupTemplate}}\n[[image:Slave Cemetry - Salaga.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Baobab at the slave cemetery, [[Salaga]].

These leaves can be up to 1.5m in length and usually densely covered in short spines on the convex lower surfaces and less so on the concave upper surfaces. Like many other [[arborescent]] aloe species, this Aloe is more spiny when it is small and as it becomes taller and less vulnerable to grazing, it loses many of the spines from its leaf surfaces. It normally has a trunk densely covered by the withered old leaves. \n\nThe [[inflorescence]] is a much-branched panicle with up to 30 or exceptionally 50 racemes. Flower colour varies a great deal, and ranges from yellow through orange (most common) to bright red. Flowering takes place through the winter months, as is the case with most aloes. \n\nThe distinctively horizontal branches of its [[inflorescence]] is an easy way to distinguish this species from other aloes. For this reason it is sometimes known as the '''flat-flowered aloe'''. (However, the type known as ''Aloe spectabilis'', has taller, less horizontal inforescences.) The densely packed flowers all tend to point upwards from the [[raceme]].<ref>http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantab/aloemarloth.htm</ref>\n\nWhen not in flower, it is easily confused with the closely related [[Aloe excelsa|Zimbabwe Aloe]], and with the similar-looking [[Aloe ferox|Cape Aloe]] and [[Aloe africana|African Aloe]] species to the south.<ref>http://davesgarden.com/guides/articles/view/212/</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\nIts distribution ranges from the Klip River Hills in [[Johannesburg]], through eastern [[Botswana]], northwards over the [[Soutpansberg]] to [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Malawi]] and eastwards through [[Swaziland]] and [[Mozambique]] to the coast. Within this range, it is especially common in mountainous areas, which led it to be known as the '''mountain aloe'''. \n\nThis species grades through intermediate forms into ''Aloe spectabilis'' [[G.W. Reynolds|Reynolds]] of [[KwaZulu-Natal]], and the two are now considered synonymous. ''Aloe marlothii'' forms natural hybrids with some 30 or more species.{{citation needed|reason=WCSP considers them distinct species|date=July 2014}}\n\n\n{{commons category|Aloe marlothii}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of Southern African indigenous trees]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}} \n*''The Aloes of South Africa'' - [[Gilbert Westacott Reynolds]] (AA Balkema, Cape Town 1969)\n*''South African Aloes'' - [[Barbara Jeppe]] (Purnell, Cape Town 1969)\n*''Guide to the Aloes of South Africa'' - Ben-Erik van Wyk & Gideon Smith (Briza, Pretoria 1996) ISBN 1-875093-04-4\n==External links==\n*{{EOL}}\n* Nectar-feeding by southern African birds, with special reference to the Mountain Aloe ''Aloe marlothii'' - [http://oo.adu.org.za/content.php?id=116 Paper in ejournal Ornithological Observations]\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aloe marlothii}}\n[[Category:Flora of South Tropical Africa]]\n[[Category:Flora of Southern Africa]]\n[[Category:Aloe|marlothii]]\n[[Category:Trees of Africa]]",

It is a medium-sized [[hardwood]] [[tree]] growing to 30\u201340 m tall, rarely larger, with a trunk 1-2.5 m diameter above the often large basal buttresses. The tree generally grows in small stands, the roots of the trees intertwined with neighboring trees.  In Gabon it is the primary [[timber]] species.\n\n==Uses==\nIt is a weak wood with low decay resistance and moderate dimensional stability. The major use of Gaboon is in the manufacture of [[plywood]]. It is about 8- 12% lighter than the other main [[Plywood#Marine plywood|marine plywood]] [[Shorea|Meranti]] that is commonly used in boatbuilding, but is not as stiff. This is useful when a boat design calls for tight radius bends such as near the bow in a single chine design because of its flexibility. However it does not resist impact damage as well as Meranti and is often sheathed in [[epoxy]] resin to increase strength and give more impact and abrasion resistance and to increase water resistance over conventional marine enamel paints. It is often used in sandwich construction using the West (and other similar) epoxy system. Its attractive appearance means that it is often used decoratively as the top surface [[Wood veneer|veneer]] in panelling and furniture or, in solid form in luxury items such as boxes for [[cigars]] or other high value items (e.g. audio equipment).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nGaboon plywood is also used in the French aircraft industry to make light airplanes, such as those built by [[Avions Robin]].  It was used extensively to manufacture the [[Jodel]] range of aircraft, which are popular throughout Europe but no longer factory-built.  However, the wood's open grain, flexibility and light weight make it a popular choice for amateur builders of Jodel aircraft to this day.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn the form known as okoume marine grade plywood, it is considered perhaps the finest construction plywood now available for boats especially where lighter weight is needed. It is widely available manufactured and certified to [[BS 1088|British Standard 1088]]. Its users range from individual hobbyist [[kayak]] builders to some of the world's largest boat builders. Most often it is used in combination with epoxy and [[fiberglass]], the combination giving a structure that can be stronger and lighter than plastic or fiberglass, rivaling the performance characteristics of more advanced composites such as [[carbon fiber]]. The grain appearance is prized, likened to that of [[mahogany]] and is often varnished for a decorative appearance.\n\nWhen used for the backs and sides of high-end acoustic guitars, Okoume (or as it is known in the trade, Akoum\u00e9) exhibits many of the tonal properties of maple. Guitars made with Okoum\u00e9 are noticeably lighter in weight than those made with mahogany or rosewood.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==References==\n*{{IUCN2006|assessor=White|year=1998|id=33213|title=Aucoumea klaineana|downloaded=11 May 2006}} Listed as Vulnerable (VU A1cd v2.3)\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929203907/http://sea.unep-wcmc.org/species/tree_study/africa/1-7.html Profiles of Africa Tree Species: ''Aucoumea klaineana'']\n*[https://forestplywood.com/infographics/marine-plywood Aucoumea klaineana Infographics]\n\n[[Category:Burseraceae]]\n[[Category:Trees of Africa]]\n[[Category:Vulnerable plants]]\n[[Category:Flora of Gabon]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Republic of the Congo]]\n[[Category:Flora of Equatorial Guinea]]",

It is common throughout coastal areas of [[Texas]] and [[Florida]], and ranges as far north as southern [[Louisiana]] and coastal [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the [[United States]].\n\nLike many other [[mangrove]] species, it reproduces by [[vivipary]]. [[Seed]]s are encased in a [[fruit]], which reveals the [[Germination|germinated]] seedling when it falls into the water.\n\nUnlike other mangrove species, it does not grow on [[Aerial root#Aerial roots as supports|prop roots]], but possesses [[Aerial root#Pneumatophores|pneumatophores]] that allow its roots to breathe even when submerged. It is a hardy species and expels absorbed salt mainly from its leathery leaves.\n\nThe name \"black mangrove\" refers to the color of the trunk and [[Wood#Heartwood and sapwood|heartwood]]. The leaves often appear whitish from the [[salt]] [[Halophyte|excreted]] at night and on cloudy days. It is often found in its native range with the red mangrove (''[[Rhizophora mangle]]'') and the white mangrove (''[[Laguncularia racemosa]]''). White mangroves grow inland from black mangroves which themselves grow inland from red mangroves. The three species work together to stabilize the shoreline, provide buffers from [[storm surge]]s, trap debris and [[detritus]] brought in by [[tide]]s, and provide feeding, breeding, and nursery grounds for a great variety of [[fish]], [[shellfish]], [[bird]]s, and other wildlife.\n\n==Habitat==\n[[Image:Black mangrove-everglades natl park.jpg|left|thumb|A black mangrove tree growing in shallow water in [[Everglades National Park]]]]\n[[Image:Avicennia germinans-flowers2.jpg|left|thumb|Black mangrove flowers]]\nThe black mangrove grows just above the high [[tide]] in coastal [[lagoon]]s and [[brackish water]] [[Estuary|estuaries]]. It is less tolerant of highly saline conditions than certain other species that occur in mangrove ecosystems.<ref>World Wildlife Fund. 2010.

The [[seed]]s [[Germination|germinate]] in midsummer, but may be seen all year on the trees. The seeds can remain viable for over a year once released.\n\n==Wood==\nThe [[Wood#Heartwood and sapwood|heartwood]] is dark-brown to black, while the [[Wood#Heartwood and sapwood|sapwood]] is yellow-brown. It has the unusual property of having less dense heartwood than sapwood. The sapwood sinks in water while the heartwood floats. The wood is strong, heavy, and hard, but is difficult to work due to its interlocked grain and is somewhat difficult to finish due to its oily texture. Uses include posts, pilings, [[charcoal]], and [[Firewood|fuel]]. Despite growing in a marine environment, the dry wood is subject to attack by marine borers and [[termite]]s. Like many species, it contains [[tannin]] in the bark and has been used to [[Tanning (leather)|tan]] [[leather]] products.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*[[List of honey plants]]\n*[[:Category:Mangrove ecoregions|Mangrove ecoregions]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*  {{cite book\n | last = Haehle\n | first =  Robert\n | year = 1999\n | title = Native Florida Plants\n | publisher = Gulf Publishing Company\n | location = Houston\n | isbn = 0-88415-425-4\n}}\n* McKee, Karen L., Irving A.

Fruits can be consumed raw and cooked. Raw fruits initially contain a sweet pulp that then dries out to a sugary solid, difficult to separate from seed. Fruits are often cooked prior to consumption.

The tree is broad and has a distinctive amber and wine red colour when the young leaves sprout during spring (August-September). It grows in savanna, both open woodland and closed woodland of Southern and Eastern Africa, mostly [[Tanzania]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Malawi]] and [[Mozambique]].\nThe word Msasa is commonly used as a proper name in African place names. The word also means 'rough plant' in [[Swahili language|Swahili]].\nOther common names: Mundu, Myombo, Mtondo (Tanzania), Muputu (Zambia). The plant is known in the Venda language as mutsiwa, which means 'the one that is left behind'. An outlying population of Brachystegia has recently been discovered in the [[Soutpansberg]] mountains of northern South Africa. This tree is a protected species in [[South Africa]].<ref name=\"dwaf\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www2.dwaf.gov.za/dwaf/cmsdocs/4116___poster%20protected%20trees.pdf \n |title=Protected Trees \n |date=3 May 2013 \n |publisher=Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, Republic of South Africa \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705085122/http://www2.dwaf.gov.za:80/dwaf/cmsdocs/4116___poster%20protected%20trees.pdf \n |archivedate=2010-07-05 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\nThe Msasa is a [[tropical]] tree and grows best in open woodland where there is a sharp distinction between wet and dry seasons. The northern end of its range is near Tabora in Tanzania (about 5\u00b0 S) and its southernmost extent is near Quissico on the coast of Mozambique just outside the tropics (about 25\u00b0 S). Msasas need a minimum of around 500 mm rain although the amount of rain in the summer growing season is more important than the annual rainfall. It needs a mean annual temperature of around 19 to 20 \u00b0C. It does not thrive under a combination of cold and wet conditions and like many tropical plants it requires a hot dry period before the onset of the growing season.\n\n==Appearance==\nThe tree typically reaches a height of about 16 metres although it is less tall in more drought-prone areas. In central Zambia and eastern [[Angola]], magnificent specimens of about 18\u201319 metres are common due to the reliability of heavy rain during the growing season. It favours inland situations at an altitude of around 1000\u20131400 metres (due to the sharp difference between day and nighttime temperatures) although it grows down to sea level at its southern extremity.\nThe tree presents a series of changes according to the seasons. It starts to lose its leaves as the cool season begins in late May (somewhat sluggishly) and by early August it is bare or nearly so. In late August as temperatures rise again, the new leaves are produced. These are often bright red in colour, but vary from almost purple to brownish in different individuals. The colour shifts to deep green over a period of 10\u201320 days. The insignificant flowers appear after the new leaves and these are followed by the [[dehiscent]] pods (about 12\u201315 cm in length) in April. As with many legume species the pods split explosively and the flat seeds (about 2 cm across) are flung some distance from the parent tree.\n\n==Ecology==\nThe Msasa is ecologically dominant over large areas of central Africa where sufficient summer rainfall is received. In many parts of Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi, it is the dominant woodland tree and its colourful springtime foliage is striking seasonal marker. It can withstand light frost as long as little rain falls during the cool season such as on the Mashonaland plateau, where it is often co-dominant with the similar Mnondo ''([[Julbernardia globiflora]])''. Further north it is less dominant but it reaches its greatest size.\nThe Msasa develops heavy spreading boughs and a shapely crown and mature specimens are valued in parks and gardens. However, it grows very slowly and so is seldom grown in cultivation.\n\n==Uses==\nThe pale brown and heavy wood is not durable and is not useful to make most articles or furniture. However, the Msasa tree is widely used for fuel, both as charcoal and firewood. It is often heavily branched and in parts of southern Tanzania the hard wood is highly sought after. It is also used for beehives, and sometimes for boats and general construction. It is considered to be a rather inferior general purpose timber.\n\nIn southern Tanzania ''B. spiciformis'' has several medicinal applications including using the roots to treat dysentery and stomach problems.\nIt is an important shade tree. The leaves are known to be a good fodder and would likely provide good mulch. The species is nitrogen-fixing.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Dale, I.R. & Greenway, P.J.

It is almost always very close to upturned umbrella shaped with a partially developed flat top, making it easy to recognise in mixed woodland. In this it differs from most of the other [[Brachystegia]] species that have variable shapes. The leaves are feathery in appearance, with around 10-12 leaflets arrayed along each leaf stalk.\n\n==Distribution==\nThe Muunze is found all over south tropical [[Africa]] and the less humid parts of east equatorial Africa. It reaches its southernmost extent around 21\u00b0 S in the [[Runde]] valley region of [[Zimbabwe]]. It is a tree of inland regions thriving at altitudes of around 900 \u2013 1750 metres. In the hotter, northern parts of its range it is found in drier types of woodland but further south it is found in both moist and dry open woodland. It prefers well-drained conditions and tolerates even very thin and rocky soils and so is usually restricted to hillsides and hilltops (not mountainous regions as such) rather than best positions in valley floors. In these positions, the tree is very easily recognisable due to its fluttering foliage, distinctive shape and flaky but smooth grey bark.\n\n==Ecology==\nThe Muunze is nowhere common but is widely distributed in its range and grows to its maximum size where many other trees find the soil too thin or poor; about 14 \u2013 16 metres depending on competition. It is a tree of open woodland in areas of contrasting wet and dry seasons, the longer the dry season, the more likely that the Muunze stands bare for a notable period. Like other Brachystegia species it needs a cool, dry resting period when it loses its leaves followed by a hot dry spell that revives the tree. At this time (usually August\u2013September) the new leaves are produced. These are a pale to rich red colour that fade to green over about a week. The Muunze is therefore a beautiful sight in springtime but it does not compare to the much more striking show put on by the closely related [[Msasa]].\nThe seeds are enclosed in a purplish woody pod. The seeds are dispersed, as in other ''Brachystegia'' species, when the drying pod is split by increasing tension in autumn (about April to May or later), hurling the seeds from it.\n\n==Name Usage==\nThe misnomer \"Mountain [[Acacia]]\" for ''B. tamarindoides'' reflects the similarity of the tree's foliage to the feathery Acacia species that are also found in Africa. Unlike African Acacias, however, the Muunze has no [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorn]]s. The name is for instance found in a paper concerning the degradation of woodlands by [[elephant]] predation and fire in the northern part of the [[Gonarezhou National Park]] in SE Zimbabwe.<ref>C.

The growth habit is columnar or multi-stemmed and the tree develops large buttress roots. The radiating anchor roots are sometimes exposed and may loop up in places. The bark is silvery-grey to orangeish-brown, smooth with occasional pustular [[lenticel]]s. The leaves are in opposite pairs, glossy yellowish-green above, obovate with entire margins, up to {{convert|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide. The flowers are borne singly in the leaf axils; each has a long stalk and a short [[Calyx (flower)|calyx]] tube, and parts in fives or sixes. The paired stamens are enclosed in the petals which open explosively when disturbed. The [[Glossary of botanical terms#ovoid|ovoid]] fruits are up to {{convert|3|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long suspended from the shrunken calyx tube. Brown at first, they change colour as they mature and the [[hypocotyl]] emerges. The hypocotyl is long and slender, growing to about {{convert|35|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long, and is ribbed, a characteristic that distinguishes this mangrove from the [[Ceriops australis|smooth-fruited yellow mangrove]] (''Ceriops australis'').<ref name=TFSS/><ref name=Duke>{{cite book|author=Duke, Norman C.|title=Australia's Mangroves: The Authoritative Guide to Australia's Mangrove Plants |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=61L3nLkJEDYC&pg=PT66 |year=2006 |publisher=MER |isbn=978-0-646-46196-0 |page=66}}</ref> \n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''C. tagal'' grows naturally in Eastern and Southern Africa, [[Madagascar]], [[Seychelles]], India, China, Indo-China, [[Malesia]], [[Papuasia]], the [[Caroline Islands]], [[New Caledonia]] and [[Australia]].<ref name=IUCN/><ref name=GRIN/> Its habitat is in brackish water areas near tidal lines.<ref name=IUCN/><ref name=TFSS/>\n\n==Uses==\nThe durable wood is used in house construction.

It is one of the plants of power in Nigerian medicine and is used to treat liver disorders especially in Senegal and Mali. Kinkeliba means the \"health tree\" and the French import kinkeliba and call it  \"tisane de longue vie\" or infusion of long life. \n*The [[branch]]es are quite strong, and are a useful material for building stools, beds, tool handles, etc.\n*A [[tea]] made produced by steeping the [[leaf|leaves]] in boiling water is a traditional tonic drink in tropical savannah countries such as Senegal, Mali and Burkina Faso.  It is believed to be an aid to weight loss and have detoxifying properties.\n*Among West African Muslims, especially Wolofs, Fulas, and Mandinkas, the leaves, bark, and twigs of Kinkiliba are harvested and sold  in bundles during the dry season leading up to and during the month of Ramadan.  The Kinkiliba is used daily to brew a strong tea that is mixed with sugar and milk and is drunk with bread at sundown as a means of breaking the daily fast.  Kinkiliba is used specifically for this purpose because of its sweet flavor and because it is believed to be an appetite stimulant, as those who have been fasting want to be able to enjoy as much rich food as possible in the evening after eating nothing from sunrise to sunset.\n*In [[Burkina Faso]], a [[decoction]] of the leaves is used as a [[medication]] for [[malaria]].\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.westafricanplants.senckenberg.de/root/index.php?page_id=14&id=396 ''Combretum micranthum''] in Brunken, U., Schmidt, M., Dressler, S., Janssen, T., Thiombiano, A. & Zizka, G. 2008.

On sandy soils this species sometimes forms pure stands, deserving consideration as a [[plant community]] or association. \n\nClosely related to ''C. glandulosa'', ''C. africana'' is usually some 5m tall, its branchlets often ending in spines. Its bark is grey-green, peeling to reveal a shiny surface, red when damaged, and then exuding [[Bdellium|bdellion]], a clear, edible, aromatic gum ('Commiphora'='gum-bearing'). The leaves are trifoliate with a large terminal leaflet and two small side leaflets, bluntly toothed, and, as with most Commiphoras, pleasantly aromatic when crushed. Fruits are reddish, and about 6\u20138&nbsp;mm across, splitting when ripe to reveal a hard, black seed held by a pseudo-[[aril]] or [[mericarp]] with four red fingers, resembling the clasps holding a jewel in a brooch or ring setting. The tree's fruits are edible while the succulent, sweet roots are often chewed by humans, and the new leaves are sought after by camels and goats, particularly at the beginning of the dry season. \n\nThis tree is extremely sensitive to atmospheric humidity and will expand its leaf buds at the first hint of moisture-laden winds. Consequently it is the first tree to come into leaf with the arrival of the wet season, and remains remarkably green throughout the rainy period.<ref>[http://www.ilri.org/InfoServ/Webpub/fulldocs/BROWSE_IN_AFRICA/Chapter50.htm ''ILRI'']</ref> In the [[Sahel]] this striking fresh appearance is shared only by ''[[Salvadora persica]]''.<ref>[http://www.worldagroforestrycentre.org/sea/products/afdbases/af/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=573 ''Agro Forestry Tree Database'']</ref> The leaves, though, survive only as long as the moist air lasts, and dry out as soon as the rainy season is over, at which time the colour of the foliage changes to a remarkable, golden hue. ''C. africana'' takes advantage of any wet spells to complete a leafing, flowering and fruiting cycle, and retreats into dormancy over unfavourable periods. Even so its foliage displays none of the features usually associated with drought-adapted plants. Herdsmen of the northern Sahel follow the rainfall patterns and the ''C. africana'' trees as they come into leaf, continually finding new areas for their animals to browse.\n\nThis species is the preferred food plant of the beetle ''[[Diamphidia]]'', the larva of which is used as a potent arrow poison. ''C. africana'' is particularly suitable as a live hedge.\n\nTree parts are used to treat a wide range of ailments - fruits for typhoid fever and stomach problems, bark for malaria, resin for convulsions and for covering and disinfecting wounds, and burnt resin as an insecticide and aphrodisiac. The soft, termite-resistant wood is used for carving domestic utensils, music instruments and general purpose items.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/docrep/X5327e/x5327e0s.htm ''Food and Agricultural Organisation'']</ref><ref>[http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/5698/Dissertation%20A%20Phytochemical%20and%20Pharmacological%20Study%20of%20Te.pdf?sequence=3 ''A Phytochemical and Pharmacological Study of Commiphora'']</ref> An edible oil is also extracted and parts of the tree exhibit strong fungicidal properties.\n\nThe bark is rich in [[flavonoid]]s, [[tannin]]s, [[Natural anthraquinone|anthraquinone]], [[cardiac glycoside]]s, [[triterpenoid]]s, [[saponin]]s, [[alkaloid]]s and [[reducing sugar]]s.

There are only 233 specimens of this [[endangered species|critically endangered]] species, the largest about 22 m tall. The majority are estimated to be over 2000 years old, with very little regeneration due to the increasing [[desertification]] of the Sahara. Rainfall totals in the area are estimated to be about 30&nbsp;mm annually.  The largest one is named Tin-Balalan is believed to be the oldest tarout tree with a circumference of 12 meters or 36 feet.\n\nThis species is distinct from the allied ''[[Cupressus sempervirens]]'' (Mediterranean cypress) in its much bluer foliage with a white resin spot on each [[leaf]], the smaller shoots often being flattened in a single plane. It also has smaller [[conifer cone|cones]], only 1.5\u20132.5&nbsp;cm long. ''[[Cupressus atlantica]]'' (Moroccan cypress) is more similar, and is treated as a variety of the Saharan cypress (''C. dupreziana'' var. ''atlantica'') by some authors.\n\nProbably as a result of its isolation and low population, the Saharan cypress has [[Evolution|evolved]] a unique reproductive system of [[apomixis|male apomixis]] whereby the [[seed]]s develop entirely from the genetic content of the [[pollen]]. There is no genetic input from the female \"parent\", which only provides nutritional sustenance (Pichot ''et al.'', 2000). The Moroccan cypress does not share this characteristic.\n\nThe Saharan cypress is occasionally cultivated in southern and western [[Europe]], in part for ''ex situ'' genetic conservation, but also as an [[ornamental plant|ornamental tree]].\n\nAn international arboretum is being established in [[Canberra]], [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT), Australia within which will be established forests of rare and endangered species from throughout the world. One of these forests is dedicated to ''Cupressus dupreziana'' and 1300 of the trees have been propagated for planting in late 2007.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n== References ==\n* Stewart, P.J. 1969.

It is used for the back and sides of acoustic guitar bodies, as well as the tops of electric guitar bodies. It is also used in manufacturing the neck piece of [[ukulele]]s and 26- and 36-string harps. In the late 90s, it started to be used as a board for Basque percussion instruments [[txalaparta]].

It is generally cut into small billets or logs with its sharply demarcated bright yellow white sapwood left on to assist in the slow drying so as to prevent cracks developing. Good quality  \"A\" grade African blackwood commands high prices on the commercial timber market. The tonal qualities of African blackwood are particularly valued when used in woodwind instruments, principally [[clarinet]]s, [[oboe]]s, [[flute|transverse flutes]], [[piccolo]]s, [[Highland pipes]], and [[Northumbrian pipes]].<ref>[http://most-expensive.com/wood Most Expensive Wood], June 22, 2009</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2016}} The timber is used mainly because of its machinability and dimensional stability. Deering Banjo Company uses blackwood (\"grenadilla\") to construct the tone ring in its John Hartford model banjo.  Deering indicates that this reduces weight versus brass/bronze tone rings, and that the wood \"plays in\" (improves in tone) with use. Furniture makers from [[ancient Egypt|the time of the Egyptians]] have valued this timber. A story states that it has even been used as ballast in trading ships and that some enterprising Northumbrian pipe makers used old discarded blackwood ballast to great effect. The German knife companies [[W\u00fcsthof]] and [[J. A. Henckels]] sell knives with blackwood handles due to the wood's moisture repellent qualities.\n\nDue to overuse, the mpingo tree is severely threatened in Kenya and is needing attention in Tanzania and Mozambique.  The trees are being harvested at an unsustainable rate, partly because of illegal smuggling of the wood into Kenya, but also because the tree takes upwards of 60 years to mature.\n\n===Relation to other woods===\n* '''African blackwood''' is no longer regarded as '''[[ebony]]''', a name now reserved for a limited number of timbers yielded by the genus ''[[Diospyros]]''; these are more of a matte appearance and are more brittle.\n* The genus ''[[Dalbergia]]'' yields other famous timbers such as [[Brazilian rosewood]] (''Dalbergia nigra''), ''[[Dalbergia cearensis]]'' and [[cocobolo]] (''Dalbergia retusa'').\n\n==Names==\nOther names by which the tree is known include ''babanus'' and ''grenadilla'', which appear as [[loanword]]s in various local English dialects.\n\n==Conservation==\nThere are multiple organisations involved in the conservation of African blackwood: the Mpingo Conservation & Development Initiative, the African Blackwood Conservation Project, and Clarinets for Conservation.\n\nThe Mpingo Conservation & Development Initiative (MCDI, formerly the Mpingo Conservation Project) is involved in research, awareness raising and practical conservation of African blackwood. Conservation of Mpingo and its natural habitat can be achieved by ensuring that local people living in mpingo harvesting areas receive a fair share of the revenue created, thus providing them with an incentive to manage the habitat in an environmentally friendly manner. In order to achieve this, the MCDI is helping communities to get Forest Stewardship Certification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mpingoconservation.org/|title=Welcome|publisher=Mpingo Conservation & Development Initiative|accessdate=2013-07-07}}</ref>\n\nThe African blackwood Conservation Project works around [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] replanting African blackwood trees, and in conservation education. It also works with adult and women's groups in the promotion of environmentally sound land uses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwoodconservation.org/index.html|title=Home|publisher=African Blackwood Conservation Project|accessdate=2013-07-07}}</ref>\n\nClarinets for Conservation is based in [[Moshi, Tanzania]] and aims to raise awareness and promote conservation of Mpingo through music education.

HowStuffWorks.com.</ref> The fruit's English name (through Old French), as well as the Latin species name ''dactylifera'', both come from the Greek word for \"finger\", ''d\u00e1ktulos'', because of the fruit's elongated shape. Dates are oval-cylindrical, 3\u20137&nbsp;cm long, and {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter, and when ripe, range from bright red to bright yellow in colour, depending on variety. Dates contain a single [[Drupe|stone]] about {{convert|2|-|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|6|-|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick. Three main [[cultivar group]]s of date exist: soft (e.g. 'Barhee', 'Halawy', 'Khadrawy', 'Medjool'), semi-dry (e.g. 'Dayri', '[[Deglet Noor]]', 'Zahdi'), and dry (e.g. 'Thoory'). The type of fruit depends on the [[glucose]], [[fructose]], and [[sucrose]] content.\n\nThe date palm is [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], having separate male and female plants. They can be easily grown from seed, but only 50% of seedlings will be female and hence fruit bearing, and dates from seedling plants are often smaller and of poorer quality. Most commercial plantations thus use [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] of heavily cropping cultivars. Plants grown from cuttings will fruit 2\u20133 years earlier than seedling plants.\n\nDates are naturally wind [[pollination|pollinated]], but in both traditional [[oasis]] [[horticulture]] and in the modern commercial orchards they are entirely [[hand pollination|pollinated manually]]. Natural pollination occurs with about an equal number of male and female plants. However, with assistance, one male can [[pollinate]] up to 100 females. Since the males are of value only as pollinators, this allows the growers to use their resources for many more fruit-producing female plants. Some growers do not even maintain any male plants, as male flowers become available at local markets at pollination time. Manual pollination is done by skilled labourers on [[ladder]]s, or by use of a wind machine. In some areas such as [[Iraq]] the pollinator climbs the tree using a special climbing tool that wraps around the tree trunk and the climber's back (called \u062a\u0628\u0644\u064a\u0629 in Arabic) to keep him attached to the trunk while climbing.\n\n[[Parthenocarpy|Parthenocarpic]] cultivars are available but the seedless fruit is smaller and of lower quality.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nDates ripen in four stages, which are known throughout the world by their [[Arabic language|Arabic]] names ''kimri'' (unripe), ''khlal'' (full-size, crunchy), ''rutab'' (ripe, soft), ''tamr'' (ripe, sun-dried).{{citation needed|reason=No similar meaning for \u0631\u064f\u062a\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629 (rutba) given on Wiktionary; the others might be incorrect too.|date=October 2015}}\n\nDates are an important traditional crop in [[Iraq]], [[Arabia]], and north Africa west to [[Morocco]]. Dates are also mentioned more than 50 times in the [[Bible]] and 20 times in the [[Qur'an]]. In [[Islam]]ic culture, dates and yogurt or milk are traditionally the first foods consumed for [[Iftar]] after the sun has set during [[Ramadan]]. Dates (especially Medjool and [[Deglet Noor]]) are also cultivated in America in southern [[California]], [[Arizona]] and southern [[Florida]] in the United States and in [[Sonora]] and [[Baja California]] in Mexico.\n\nDate palms can take 4 to 8 years after planting before they will bear fruit, and produce viable yields for commercial harvest between 7 and 10 years. Mature date palms can produce 68 to 176 kilograms (150<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plantsciences.ucdavis.edu/GEPTS/pb143/CROP/DATE/date.htm|title=The Date, Phoenix dactylifera|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref> to 300<ref>http://www.unce.unr.edu/publications/files/ho/2002/sp0212.pdf</ref> [[pound (mass)|lb]]) of dates per harvest season, although they do not all ripen at the same time so several harvests are required. In order to get fruit of marketable quality, the bunches of dates must be thinned and bagged or covered before ripening so that the remaining fruits grow larger and are protected from weather and pests such as birds.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Cultivars===\n{{Refimprove|list|date=November 2013}}\n[[File:Date Palm,.JPG|thumb|Date Palm, Kalka, Haryana, India]]\n[[Image:Phoenix dactylifera1.jpg|right|thumb|Date palm orchard, Boumalne, Morocco]]\n[[File:\u0645\u0634\u0647\u062f\u0645\u0646 \u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0628\u0648\u0639\u064a\u0629 \u0628\u0635\u064a\u0627\u062f\u0629 2012.JPG|thumb|Dates in the [[souq]] in [[Sayada, Tunisia|Sayada]]]]\n[[File:Date farm.JPG|right|thumb|Date farm in [[Medina]].]]\nA large number of date [[cultivar]]s are grown.

The process of [[palm tapping]] involves the cutting of the unopened flower stalk and then fastening a [[bottle gourd]], clay or plastic vessel on to it. The palm sap then collects in the vessel and is harvested in the early morning hours. If a few drops of lime juice are added to the palm [[sap]], fermentation can be stopped and the [[sap]] can then be boiled to form [[palm syrup]], [[palm sugar]], [[jaggery]] and numerous other edible products derived from the syrup.\nIn [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], North Africa, [[Ghana]], and [[Ivory Coast]], date palms are tapped for the sweet [[Plant sap|sap]], which is converted into palm sugar (known as ''[[jaggery]]'' or ''gur''), [[molasses]] or alcoholic beverages. In North Africa the sap obtained from tapping palm trees is known as l\u0101gb\u012b. If left for a sufficient period of time (typically hours, depending on the temperature) l\u0101gb\u012b easily becomes an alcoholic drink.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Special skill is required when tapping the palm tree so that it does not die.\n\n===Leaves===\nDate palm leaves are used for [[Palm Sunday]] in the [[Christian]] religion. In North Africa, they are commonly used for making huts. Mature leaves are also made into mats, screens, baskets and fans. Processed leaves can be used for [[Thermal insulation|insulating board]]. Dried leaf [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]s are a source of [[cellulose]] pulp, used for walking sticks, brooms, fishing floats and fuel. Leaf sheaths are prized for their scent, and fibre from them is also used for rope, coarse cloth, and large hats. The leaves are also used as a [[lulav]] in the Jewish holiday of [[Sukkot]].\n\nYoung date leaves are cooked and eaten as a vegetable, as is the terminal bud or heart, though its removal kills the palm. The finely ground seeds are mixed with [[flour]] to make bread in times of scarcity. The flowers of the date palm are also edible. Traditionally the female flowers are the most available for sale and weigh 300\u2013400&nbsp;grams. The flower buds are used in salad or ground with dried fish to make a [[condiment]] for bread.\n\n===Wood===\n{{Self-contradictory|section|date=April 2017}}\n[[Image:Phoenix dactylifera3.jpg|left|thumb|Date Palm stump showing the wood structure]]\nDate palm [[wood]] is used for posts and rafters for huts; it is lighter than [[coconut]] and not very durable. It is also used for construction such as bridges and aqueducts, and parts of [[dhow]]s. Leftover wood is burnt for fuel.\n\n==Cultural symbols==\n[[File:Coat of arms of Saudi Arabia.svg|thumb|120 px|right|Date Palm in the [[Coat of arms of Saudi Arabia|Coat of arms]] of [[Saudi Arabia]].]]\n{{Details|Palm branch (symbol)}}\nThe date palm represents the provincial tree of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)]] (unofficial).\n\n==Symbolic connotations==\n\nIn the [[Quran]], [[Allah]] instructs ''Mary\u0101m'' (the Virgin Mary) to eat dates when she gives birth to Isa (Jesus);<ref>The Holy Quran, [http://quran.al-islam.com/Page.aspx?pageid=221&BookID=15&Page=306 Chapter 12 - verses 22-25], retrieved on Feb. 28 2015, ''So she [Virgin Mary] conceived him, and she retired with him to a remote place. And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. she cried (in her anguish): 'Ah! would that I had died before this! would that I had been a thing forgotten and out of sight!' But (a voice) cried to her from beneath the (palm-tree): 'Grieve not! for thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thee; And shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm-tree; it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon thee.'

This disease, which kills many of the popular older cultivars like [[Deglet Noor]], has led to a major decline in production where it is present, notably [[Morocco]] and western [[Algeria]]. However, new cultivars resistant to the disease are being developed. {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\nA major palm pest, the red palm beetle (''[[Rhynchophorus ferrugineus]]'') currently poses a significant threat to date production in parts of the Middle East as well as to iconic landscape specimens throughout the Mediterranean world.\n\nIn the 1920s, eleven healthy [[Madjool palm]]s were transferred from Morocco to the United States where they were tended by members of the [[Chemehuevi]] tribe{{which|date=January 2015}} in a remote region of Nevada. Nine of these survived and in 1935, cultivars were transferred to the \"[[USDA Date Station|U.S. Date Garden]]\" in [[Indio, California]]. Eventually this stock was reintroduced to Africa and led to the U.S. production of dates in [[Yuma, Arizona]] and the [[Bard Valley]] in California.<ref name=\"ICN_Allen\">{{cite news | title=How One Indian Couple Saved 'The Fruit of Kings' | first=Lee | last=Allen | work=Indian Country News | date=25 April 2014 | url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/25/how-one-indian-couple-saved-fruit-kings-154535 | accessdate=2016-02-27}}</ref><ref name=\"USDA_Krueger\">{{cite web | last=Krueger | first=Robert R | title=Date Palm Genetic Resource Conservation, Breeding, Genetics, And Genomics In California | publisher=The Conference Exchange | url=https://pag.confex.com/pag/xx/recordingredirect.cgi/id/137 | format=PDF | accessdate=2016-02-27}}</ref>\n\n==Date palm genome==\nIn 2009, a team of researchers at the  Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar published a draft version of the date palm genome (Khalas variety).<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090501162809.htm Date Palm Genome Drafted] Science Daily, January 14, 2010, Retrieved August 30, 2010</ref><ref>[http://qatar-weill.cornell.edu/research/datepalmGenome/index.html Date Palm Draft Sequence] Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar, updated April 7, 2010, Retrieved August 30, 2010</ref>\n\n==Types of dates==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}\nSeveral types of dates can be found in Arabia, some of them are listed here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is noted for its fern-like leaves and flamboyant display of flowers. In many tropical parts of the world it is grown as an [[ornamental tree]] and in English it is given the name '''royal poinciana''' or '''flamboyant'''. It is also one of several trees known as \"[[flame tree]]\".\n\nThis species was previously placed in the genus ''Poinciana'', named for [[Phillippe de Longvilliers de Poincy]], the 17th century governor of Saint Christophe ([[Saint Kitts]]). It is a non nodulating [[legume]].\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Flower, leaves & pods I IMG 8687.jpg|left|thumb|Flower, leaves & pods in [[Kolkata]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]].]]\n[[File:Yellow poinciana full bloom 20110518.jpg|thumb|left|''Delonix regia ''var.'' flavida'' is a rarer, yellow-flowered variety.<ref name=\"Burke2005\" />]]\n[[File:Gulmohar leaves closeup.JPG|thumb|left|Closeup of leaves]]\nThe flowers of ''Delonix regia'' are large, with four spreading scarlet or orange-red petals up to 8&nbsp;cm long, and a fifth upright petal called the standard, which is slightly larger and spotted with yellow and white.

In the wild it is [[endangered species|endangered]], but it is widely cultivated elsewhere.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nThe royal poinciana requires a tropical or near-tropical climate, but can tolerate drought and salty conditions. It prefers an open, free-draining sandy or loamy soil enriched with organic matter. The tree does not like heavy or clay soils and flowers more profusely when kept slightly dry.\n\nIn addition to its ornamental value, it is also a useful shade tree in tropical conditions, because it usually grows to a modest height (mostly 5 meters, but it can reach an maximum height of 12 meters) but spreads widely, and its dense foliage provides full shade. In areas with a marked dry season, it sheds its leaves during the drought, but in other areas it is virtually evergreen.\n\nIn the continental [[United States]], it grows in [[South Florida]], [[Central Florida]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/st228|title=ENH387/ST228: Delonix regia: Royal Poinciana|author=Edward F.

It is much loved in the [[Caribbean]]  and is featured in many Dominican & Puerto Rican paintings. It can also be found in [[The Bahamas]], [[Cuba]], [[Haiti]], [[Hawaii]], [[Mexico]] (especially in the [[Yucatan peninsula]]), [[Nicaragua]], [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[Guam]], [[Canary Islands]], the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]], where it is the official tree of the islands, and [[Israel]]. It is the national flower of [[St. Kitts and Nevis]]. In [[Mauritius]] and [[La R\u00e9union]] it announces the coming of the new year. It is very widely grown in the Northern [[Australia]] (the southern extremes previously limited to South East [[Queensland]], although it now grows and blooms successfully in [[Sydney]] with flowering trees identified in the suburbs of [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]], [[Parramatta]],  [[Guildford]], [[Warwick Farm, New South Wales|Warwick Farm]] and [[Kurmond, New South Wales|Kurmond]]), [[Hong Kong]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Spain]] ([[Costa del Sol|southern coast of Spain]]) the [[Comunidad Valenciana|valencian coast]] and on all [[Canary Islands]], [[Thailand]], [[Philippines]], [[Sri Lanka]] and southern [[China]].

It is a popular street tree in the suburbs of [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]. The tree is also found in [[India]], where it is referred to as the Gulmohar, or Gul Mohr.<ref>{{cite book |title=Flowering Trees and Shrubs in India |edition=Sixth |last=Cowen |first=D. V. |year=1984 |publisher=THACKER and Co. Ltd. |location=[[Bombay]] |page=1}}</ref> In [[West Bengal]] (India) and [[Bangladesh]] it is called Krishnachura.\n\nThe town of [[Pe\u00f1uelas, Puerto Rico]], located about {{convert|12|mi|km|disp=or|sp=us}} west of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], is nicknamed \"''El Valle de los Flamboyanes''\" (\"The Valley of the Poinciana Trees\"), as many flamboyant trees are found along the surrounding [[R\u00edo Guayanes]], [[R\u00edo Macana]], and [[R\u00edo Tallaboa]] Rivers.\n\nIn Vietnam, this tree is called \"Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng v\u1ef9\", or phoenix's tail, and is a popular urban tree in much of Vietnam. Its flowering season is May\u2013July, which coincides with the end of the school year in Vietnam. Because of this timing, the flower of poinciana is sometimes called the \"flower of pupil\". Hai Phong city is nicknamed \"''Th\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 hoa ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng \u0111\u1ecf''\" (\"City of red poinciana\")\n\n=== Propagation ===\n[[File:Bonnet macaque eating Delonix regia flowers 02.JPG|thumb|left|A [[bonnet macaque]] eating flowers]]\nThe royal poinciana is most commonly propagated by seeds. Seeds are collected, soaked in warm water for at least 24 hours, and planted in warm, moist soil in a semi-shaded, sheltered position. In lieu of soaking, the seeds can also be 'nicked' or 'pinched' (with a small scissors or nail clipper) and planted immediately. These two methods allow moisture to penetrate the tough outer casing, stimulating germination. The seedlings grow rapidly and can reach 30&nbsp;cm in a few weeks under ideal conditions.\n\nLess common, but just as effective, is propagation by semi-hardwood cuttings. Branches consisting of the current or last season's growth can be cut into 30&nbsp;cm sections and planted in a moist potting mixture. This method is slower than seed propagation (cuttings take a few months to root) but is the preferred method for ensuring new trees are true to form. As such, cuttings are a particularly common method of propagation for the rarer yellow-flowering variety of the tree.\n\n== Flowering season ==\n[[File:Royal Poinciana (Delonix regia) 006.JPG|thumb|left|225px|Royal poinciana in [[Martin County, Florida]], May]]\n[[File:Flowers delhi.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Gulmohar flowers in [[New Delhi]]]]\n* Bangladesh: April\u2013May\n* South Florida: May\u2013June\n* Egypt: May\u2013June\n* Vietnam: May\u2013July\n* Caribbean: May\u2013September\n* Indian Subcontinent: April\u2013June\n* Australia: November\u2013February\n* Northern Mariana Islands: March\u2013June\n* United Arab Emirates: May\u2013July\n* Brazil: November\u2013February\n* Southern Sudan: March\u2013May\n* Thailand: April\u2013May\n* Philippines: April\u2013May\n* Peru (coast): January\u2013March\n* Malawi,Zambia and Zimbabwe: October\u2013December\n* Hong Kong: May\u2013June\n* Mauritius: November\u2013December\n* Israel: May\u2013June\n* Hawaii: May\u2013June\n\n== Cultural significance ==\nIn the Indian state of [[Kerala]], royal poinciana is called ''kaalvarippoo'' which means the flower of [[Calvary]]. There is a popular belief among [[Saint Thomas Christians]] of Kerala that when [[Jesus]] was crucified, there was a small royal poinciana tree nearby his [[Cross]]. It is believed that the blood of Jesus Christ was shed over the flowers of the tree and this is how the flowers of royal poinciana got a sharp red color.<ref name=\"ThomasThomas1984\">{{cite book|author1=Annamma Thomas|author2=T.

It is variously treated as the only genus of the family '''Didymelaceae''' \u2014 or in the family [[Buxaceae]], as in the [[APG III system]].\n\nThe genus ''Didymeles'' is restricted to [[Madagascar]] and the [[Comoro Islands|Comoros]]. In Madagascar, the two species are found in humid montane habitats, up to 1,500&nbsp;m, in two disconnected areas in the north-east and south-east of the island.<ref name=Tropicos_17_40030622/> Fossils assignable to this genus have been found in [[New Zealand]],<ref name=APWeb/> suggesting a much wider distribution in the past.\n\nThe [[conservation status]] of ''D.&nbsp;integrifolia'' has been assessed as of \"least concern\".<ref name=Tropicos_17_40030622/>\n\n==Description==\nSpecies are [[Dioecy|dioecious]] (i.e. \"male\" and \"female\" flowers occur on separate plants). Individual flowers have a very simple structure, without obvious [[petal]]s or [[sepal]]s. Female flowers have been interpreted in different ways, either as having two [[Gynoecium|carpel]]s or as occurring close together in pairs, each with a single carpel.\n\n''Didymeles'' species are evergreen trees. The simple leaves are leathery in texture, with untoothed (entire) margins. There are no [[stipule]]s. The flowers are unisexual, with the two kinds borne on separate plants (i.e. the species are [[Dioecy|dioecious]]). The staminate (\"male\") flowers are arranged in short [[panicle]]s. Each flower basically consists only of two [[stamen]]s.<ref name=WatsDall92/> The carpellate (\"female\") flowers are arranged in [[thyrse]]s (spike-like structures). At the base of the [[inflorescence]] there are a number of empty [[bract]]s followed by up to 15 bracts arranged in a spiral, each of which is at the base of a side branch of the inflorescence. At the apex of each side branch there is a structure made up of two larger \"scales\", each with a smaller \"scale\" at its base, and two [[Gynoecium|carpel]]s, somewhat separated from one another, often with a small \"hump\" in between.<ref name=VonBSchaEndr03/> The [[pollen]] of ''Didymeles'' is distinctive. The grain has three furrows ([[Colpus|colpi]]), as is commonly the case for eudicots, but each colpus then contains two circular openings or pores.<ref name=WatsDall92/>\n\nThe carpellate flowers have been interpreted differently. When the genus was first described,  the two carpels were considered to belong to a single flower, each \"female\" flower having two carpels just as the \"male\" flowers have two stamens. This interpretation has been accepted by some later researchers. The \"scales\" then correspond to [[tepal]]s of the single flower. The alternative interpretation, preferred by von Balthazar et al., is that there are two flowers very close together, each with a single carpel. Only the smaller \"scale\" might then correspond to a tepal.<ref name=VonBSchaEndr03/>\n\nEach carpel has a broad two-crested [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]] on a short style, and usually contains a single ovule. The [[integument]] \u2013 the covering on the outside of the ovule \u2013 is in the form of a long coiled tube, an unusual feature in flowering plants. The fruit which forms after fertilization is a fleshy [[drupe]], to which the stigma remains attached.<ref name=VonBSchaEndr03/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n===Genus===\nThe genus was first described by [[Louis-Marie Aubert du Petit-Thouars]] in 1804. He described the staminate (\"male\") flowers as composed only of two stamens and the pistillate (carpellate, \"female\") flowers as composed only of two pistils. For this reason he named the genus from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03b9\u03b4\u03cd\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2}} \"twin\" and {{lang|grc|\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u1f72\u03c2}} \"members\". He described the genus as containing a tree from Madagascar, but did not name the species.<ref name=DuPT04/> In 1805, [[Jean Henri Jaume Saint-Hilaire]] established ''[[Didymeles integrifolia]]'' as the name of the [[Type (biology)|type species]] of the genus.<ref name=Tropicos_10800003/>\n\nPlacement in a [[Family (biology)|family]] was uncertain for a long time: von Balthazar et al. list 9 families or orders it was placed in, or allied with, between 1873 and 1974.

Jackals are fond of the fruits, hence the common names.\n\nMature trees have dark gray fissured bark. An adult tree reaches an average of 4 to 6 metres in height, though occasionally trees reach 25 metres. The foliage is dense and dark green with [[elliptical]] leaves, which are often eaten by grazing animals such as [[elephants]] and [[african buffalo|buffalo]]. The tree flowers in the rainy season; the flowers are [[Flower#Flower anatomy|imperfect]], with genders on separate trees, and are cream-colored. The female tree bears fruit in the dry season and these are eaten by many wild animals; they are oval-shaped, yellow and about 20-30mm in diameter. When the fruits ripen they turn purple. The tree, like [[Marula]], is favoured by the Bantu, who will leave them growing in their cultivated lands in order to harvest the fruit.\n\n==Growth==\nJakkalsbessie trees often grow on [[Termite#Mounds|termite mounds]], preferring deep [[Alluvium|alluvial soil]]s, but not uncommon on the savanna on sandy soils. It grows in [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] with [[termite]]s, which aerate the soil for the tree but do not eat the living wood; in turn, the tree provides protection for the termites. Jakkalsbessie is the largest species in this genus in Southern Africa. This species is widespread, north up to the Sahara. It is a member of the family [[Ebenaceae]], together with trees such as true [[ebony]] (''Diospyros ebenum'') and the edible [[persimmon]], (''Diospyros kaki'').\n\n== Uses ==\n\n===Fruit===\nA traditional food plant in Africa, this fruit has potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable landcare.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink= |author=National Research Council |editor= |others= |title=Lost Crops of Africa: Volume III: Fruits |origdate= |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11879 |format= |accessdate=2008-07-25 |edition= |series=Lost Crops of Africa |volume=3 |date=2008-01-25 |publisher=National Academies Press |location= |isbn=978-0-309-10596-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter=Ebony |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11879&page=253 |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nThe fruit is edible for humans; its flavor has been described as [[lemon]]-like, with a chalky consistency. They are sometimes [[Jam|preserved]], can be dried and ground into a [[flour]], and are often used for brewing [[beer]] and [[brandy]].\n\nThe [[Ovambo people]] call the fruit of the Jackalberry ''eenyandi'' and use it to distill ''Ombike'', their traditional liquor.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.newera.com.na/articles/48705/Ombike---a-potent-traditional-brew\n|title=Ombike \u2013 a potent traditional brew\n|last=Shaanika\n|first=Helvy\n|date=26 October 2012\n|newspaper=[[New Era (Namibia)|New Era]]}}</ref>\n\n===Medicinal===\nThe leaves, bark and roots of the tree contain [[tannin]], which can be used as a [[styptic]] to staunch bleeding. The roots are consumed to purge [[parasitism|parasites]] and is thought to be a remedy for [[leprosy]].\n\n===Wood===\nThe wood of the jakkalsbessie is almost impervious to termite damage. The heart wood is fine-grained and strong, and is often used for making wood floors and furniture. Trunks of the tree are used for [[canoes]]. The wood ranges in color from light reddish-brown to a very dark brown.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikispecies}}\n{{Commons}}\n*[http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/jackalberry_tree.htm Blue Planet Biomes article on the Jackalberry]\n*[http://www.westafricanplants.senckenberg.de/root/index.php?page_id=14&id=590 ''Diospyros mespiliformis''] in U.

This evergreen species is named after its dark red resin, which is known as \"dragon's blood\". Unlike most [[monocot]] plants, ''Dracaena'' displays secondary growth, ''D. cinnabari'' even has growth zones resembling [[tree ring]]s found in dicot tree species. Along with other arborescent ''Dracaena'' species it has a distinctive growth habit called \"dracoid habitus\".<ref>{{Cite thesis|last= Bos|first =J.J.|year= 1984|title= ''Dracaena'' in West Africa|type= PhD|publisher= Agricultural University Wageningen}}</ref> Its leaves are found only at the end of its youngest branches; its leaves are all shed every 3 or 4 years before new leaves simultaneously mature.

As they develop they turn from green to black, and then become orange when ripe. The berries are eaten by birds (e.g. ''[[Onychognathus frater|Onychognatus]]'' species) and thereby [[seed dispersal|dispersed]].

It branches at maturity to produce an umbrella-shaped crown, with leaves that measure up to 60&nbsp;cm long and 3&nbsp;cm wide. The trunk and the branches of the dragon blood are thick and stout and display dichotomous branching, where each of the branches repeatedly divides in two sections.\n\n===Biology===\nThe dragon's blood tree usually produces its flowers around February, though flowering does vary with location. The flowers tend to grow at the end of the branches. The flowers have inflorescences, and they bear small clusters of fragrant, white or green flowers. The fruits take five months to completely mature. The fruits are described as a fleshy berry, which changes from green to black as it gradually ripens. The fleshy berry fruit ends up being an orange-red color that contains one to three seeds. The berries are usually eaten and dispersed by birds and other animals.\n\nThe unusual shape of the dragon's blood tree is an adaptation for survival in arid conditions with low amounts of soil, such as in mountaintops. The large, packed crown provides shade and reduces evaporation. This shade also aids in the survival of seedlings growing beneath the adult tree, explaining why the trees tend to grow closer together.<ref name=\"Dracaena cinnabari\" />\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe first description of ''D. cinnabari'' was made during a survey of Socotra led by [[James Raymond Wellsted|Lieutenant Wellsted]] of the [[East India Company]] in 1835. It was first named '''''Pterocarpus draco''''', but in 1880, the Scottish botanist [[Isaac Bayley Balfour]] made a formal [[wikt:description|description]] of the species and renamed it as ''Dracaena cinnabari''.<ref name=guptaBCT>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.jep.2007.10.018| pmid = 18060708| year = 2008| last1 = Gupta | first1 = D.| last2 = Bleakley | first2 = B.| last3 = Gupta | first3 = R.| title = Dragon's blood: botany, chemistry and therapeutic uses| volume = 115| issue = 3| pages = 361\u2013380| journal = Journal of Ethnopharmacology}}</ref> Of between 60 and 100 ''Dracaena'' species, ''D. cinnabari'' is one of only 6 species which grow as a tree.<ref name=adoltage>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s00468-003-0279-6| title = Age structure and growth of Dracaena cinnabari populations on Socotra| year = 2004| last1 = Adolt | first1 = R.| last2 = Pavlis | first2 = J.| journal = Trees - Structure and Function| volume = 18| pages = 43\u201353}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution===\nAlong with other plants on Socotra, ''D. cinnabari'' is thought to have derived from the [[Tethyan flora]].

This is putting more pressure on the vegetation through the process of logging, overgrazing, woodcutting and infrastructure of development plans. Though the dragon\u2019s blood tree is highly widespread, it has become fragmented due to the development that has occurred in its habitats. Many of its populations are suffering due to poor regeneration. Human activities have greatly reduced the dragon\u2019s blood population through overgrazing, and feeding the flowers and fruits to the livestock of the island. One of the species' greatest threats is the gradual drying out of the Socotra Archipelago, which has been an ongoing process for the last few hundred years. This has resulted in non flourishing trees, and the duration of the mist and cloud around the area seems to also be decreasing. Increasing arid environments is predicted to cause a 45 percent reduction in the available habitat for ''D. cinnabari'' by the year 2080.\n\nAdditional threats to the dragon's blood tree include harvesting of its resin and use of the leaves to make rope. Presently some of the dragon\u2019s blood trees have been used to make beehives. This was generally prohibited; this displays how the species may be threatened by a breakdown in the traditional practices of the island.\n\nThe best preserved and largest stand of ''D. cinnabari'' is on the limestone plateau named Rokeb di Firmihin. This approximately {{convert|540|ha}} forest has numerous rare and endemic species. Research shows that in coming decades the number of trees in this forest will decrease due to the lack of natural regeneration.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://mendelu.vedeckecasopisy.cz/publicFiles/00139.pdf |last=Hubalkova |first=I. |title=Prediction of Dragon's Blood Tree (Dracaena Cinnabari Balf.)

There are multiple efforts that are being developed to help create and support a sustainable habitat and biodiversity management programs on Socotra. The dragon\u2019s blood tree is considered as an important species for commodity and for conservation efforts on the island. The dragon\u2019s blood falls under an umbrella species. This is a species selected for making conservation related decisions, typically because protecting these species indirectly protects the many other species that make up the ecological community of its habitat. Species conservation can be subjective because it is difficult to determine the status of many species. Thus, the dragons blood protection efforts would also benefit many other plants and animals within the area.\n\nThe dragon's blood tree is given some protection from international commercial trade under the listing of all ''Dracaena'' species on Appendix II of CITES (3), but if its populations are to be effectively preserved, a variety of measures will need to be taken. These include urgent monitoring of the species' natural regeneration and the expansion of Skund Nature Sanctuary to cover important areas of the habitats. Also, efforts to avoid road construction in the dragon blood\u2019s habitat, and limit grazing need to be brought to attention. Additional conservation efforts for the tree involve fencing against livestock, watering of seedlings in open areas, and involving local communities in planting seedlings.\n\n==Uses==\nDragon's blood is used as a stimulant and [[abortifacient]].<ref>Handbook of Medicinal Herbs https://books.google.com/books?id=8AJkBmPDRUUC&pg=PA256&lpg=PA256&dq=dragon's+blood+abortion&source=bl&ots=MKL2zg0nGD&sig=xEJSBCupdoOG_MUgMWJePePfYvY&hl=en&ei=-vX_TL7NItLSngf4r8zlDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=dragon's%20blood%20abortion&f=false</ref> The root yields a gum-resin, used in gargle water as a stimulant, [[astringent]] and in toothpaste.

The flowers, which only occur once from the centre of the plant at the end of that plant's life, are in massive pendant [[thyrse]]s covered by large pink [[bract]]s. The fruits are inedible (''insipid'', flavorless)<ref>http://ecocrop.fao.org/ecocrop/srv/en/cropView?id=5700</ref> and have hard, black, rounded seeds. After flowering, the plant dies.\n\n==Use as a foodcrop==\n\"Enset provides more amount of foodstuff per unit area than most cereals. It is estimated that 40 to 60 enset plants occupying 250-375 sq. meters can provide enough food for a family of 5 to 6 people.\" \u2013 Country Information Brief, [[FAO]] June 1995.\n\nEnset (''E. ventricosum'') is Ethiopia's most important [[root crop]], a traditional staple in the densely populated south and southwestern parts of Ethiopia.<ref>[[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]], ''Economic History of Ethiopia'' (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University, 1968), p. 194. Pankhurst uses the taxononym ''Musa ensete''.</ref> Its importance to the diet and economy of the Gurage and Sidama peoples was first recorded by [[Jer\u00f3nimo Lobo]].<ref>Jer\u00f3nimo Lobo, ''The Itiner\u00e1rio of Jer\u00f3nimo Lobo'', translated by Donald M. Lockhart (London: Hakluyt Society, 1984), pp. 245f</ref> The root is the main edible portion as its fruit is insipid. Each plant takes four to five years to mature, at which time a single root will give 40&nbsp;kg of food. Due to the long period of time from planting to harvest, plantings need to be staggered over time, to ensure that there is enset available for harvest in every season. Enset will tolerate [[drought]] better than most [[cereal crop]]s.\n\nWild enset plants are produced from [[seed]]s, while most domesticated plants are propagated from [[basal shoot|suckers]]. Up to 400 suckers can be produced from just one mother plant. In 1994 3,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of enset were grown in Ethiopia, with a harvest estimated to be almost 10 tonnes per hectare. Enset is often intercropped with [[sorghum]], although the practice amongst the Gedeo is to intercrop it with [[Coffea|coffee]].<ref>Kippie Kanshie, T. [http://www.treemail.nl/download/treebook5.pdf \"Five thousand years of sustainability? A case study on Gedeo land use\"] (PhD dissertation: May 2002), p. 38</ref> It is a major crop, although often supplemented with cereal crops.<ref>Kippie Kanshie, T. \"Five thousand years\", p. 19</ref>\n\nHowever its value as a [[famine food]] has fallen due to a number of causes, as detailed in the April 2003 issue of the UN-OCHA Ethiopia unit's ''Focus on Ethiopia'':\n<blockquote>Apart from an Enset plant disease epidemic in 1984-85 which wiped out large parts of the plantations and created the green famine, in the past 10 years major factors were recurrent drought and food shortage together with acute land shortage that forced farmers more and more into consumption of immature plants. Hence farmers were overexploiting their Enset reserves thereby causing gradual losses and disappearance of the false banana as an important household food security reserve. Even though not all the plant losses can be attributed to drought and land shortage and hence early consumption of immature crops, estimations go as far as more than 60% of the false banana crop stands have been lost in some areas in [[SNNPR]] during the last 10 years. This basically means that a great many people who used to close the food gap with false banana consumption are not able to do so any more, and lacking a viable alternative, have become food insecure and highly vulnerable to climatic and economic disruptions of their agricultural system.<ref>[http://www.ocha-eth.org/Archive/2003ArchiveFOE.htm \"Enset as staple food not valuable anymore to bridge food gap\", ''Focus on Ethiopia'', April 2003], UN-OCHA-Ethiopia (accessed 3 March 2009)</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe young and tender tissues in the centre or heart of the plant (the [[apical meristem|growing point]]) are cooked and eaten, being tasty and nutritious and very like the core of palms and cycads. In Ethiopia, more than 150 000 ha are cultivated for the starchy staple food prepared from the pulverised trunk and inflorescence stalk. Fermenting these pulverised parts results in a food called ''kocho''. ''Bulla'' is made from the liquid squeezed out of the mixture and sometimes eaten as a porridge, while the remaining solids are suitable for consumption after a settling period of some days. Mixed kocho and bulla can be kneaded into dough, then flattened and baked over a fire. Kocho is in places regarded as a delicacy, suitable for serving at feasts and ceremonies such as weddings, when wheat flour is added. The fresh [[corm]] is cooked like potatoes before eating. Dry kocho and bulla are energy-rich and produce from 1400 to 2000[[Kilojoule|kJ]] per 100g.\n\n==Other uses==\nThe plant is quick-growing and often cultivated as an ornamental plant.

In 1853 the British Consul at Mussowah sent some seeds to [[Kew Gardens]], mentioning that their native name was ''ansett''. Kew, quite understandably, did not make the connection, especially as they had never before seen such seeds. However, when the seeds had germinated and the plants had rapidly gained size, their relationship to the true banana became obvious.\n\nBruce also discussed the plant's place in the mythology of Egypt and pointed out that some Egyptian statue carvings depict the goddess Isis sitting among the leaves of what was thought to be a banana plant, a plant native to Southeast Asia and not known in Ancient Egypt.<ref>''Curtis's Botanical Magazine'' vol. 87 (1861)</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=cthTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA469&lpg=PA469&dq=Maitsha+Ethiopia&source=bl&ots=ZY5-pU7-SQ&sig=6NOWqrkgNCBSnEC-JHmr5iUHwBA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=AN5wT6GHHKP80QX8zOSOAg&sqi=2&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Maitsha%20Ethiopia&f=false Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]</ref>\n\nSir [[John Kirk (explorer)|John Kirk]] felt that in habit ''[[Ensete livingstonianum]]'' is indistinguishable from  ''E. ventricosum'' and noted that both are found in the mountains of equatorial Africa.\n\n==Known variants and hybrids==\n* ''Ensete ventricosum 'Atropurpureum'\n* ''Ensete ventricosum 'Green Stripe'\n* Red false banana (''Ensete ventricosum'' 'Maurelii', syn.

The spelling  \"sycomore\", with an O rather than an A as the second vowel is, if used, specific to ''Ficus sycomorus'' .<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sycomore | title = sycomore | work = Merriam-Webster.com | accessdate = 2016-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sycamore | accessdate = 2016-10-30 | title = sycamore | work = Collins English Dictionary }}</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\n[[File:Sycamore fruits.jpg|thumb|thumb|upright|Cluster of sycomore fig [[syconium|syconia]]]]\n''Ficus sycomorus'' is native to [[Africa]] south of the [[Sahel]] and north of the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], also excluding the central-west [[rainforest]] areas. It also grows naturally in [[Lebanon]], whose famous Gemmayzeh Street is derived from the tree's Arabic name, ''Gemmayz''; in the southern [[Arabian Peninsula]]; in [[Cyprus]]; in very localized areas in [[Madagascar]]; and as a naturalised species in [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]]. In its native habitat, the tree is usually found in rich soils along rivers and in mixed woodlands.\n\n==Description==\n''Ficus sycomorus'' grows to 20 m tall and has a considerable spread as can be seen from the photograph below right, with a dense round crown of spreading branches{{clarify|date=February 2013}}<!--If the tree is over three times as tall as wide, in what sense is it spreading?  I think the 6m was meant to be 60m, about 3 times the height of the tree.  But that photo is not definitive - there may be other shapes and typical sizes-->. The [[leaf|leaves]] are heart-shaped with a round apex, 14&nbsp;cm long by 10&nbsp;cm wide, and arranged spirally around the twig. They are dark green above and lighter with prominent yellow veins below, and both surfaces are rough to the touch. The petiole is 0.5\u20133&nbsp;cm long and pubescent. The [[fruit]] is a large edible fig, 2\u20133&nbsp;cm in diameter, ripening from buff-green to yellow or red. They are borne in thick clusters on long branchlets or the leaf axil. Flowering and fruiting occurs year-round, peaking from July to December. The [[bark]] is green-yellow to orange and exfoliates in papery strips to reveal the yellow inner bark.  Like all other figs, it contains a [[latex]].\n\n==Cultivation==\nAccording to [[botany|botanists]] [[Daniel Zohary]] (b. 1926) and [[Maria Hopf]] (1914-2008), the [[ancient Egypt]]ians cultivated this species \"almost exclusively.\"{{clarify|date=February 2013}} Remains of ''F. sycomorus'' begin to appear in predynastic levels and in quantity from the start of the [[third millennium BC|third millennium BCE]]. It was the ancient Egyptian [[Tree of Life]].<ref>\"Death and salvation in ancient Egypt\", Jan Assmann, David Lorton, Translated by David Lorton, p171, Cornell University Press, 2005, ISBN 0-8014-4241-9</ref> Zohary and Hopf note that \"the fruit and the timber, and sometimes even the twigs, are richly represented in the [[tomb]]s of the Egyptian Early, Middle and Late Kingdoms.\" In numerous cases the parched fruiting bodies, known as [[Syconium|sycon]]s, \"bear characteristic gashing marks indicating that this art, which induces ripening, was practiced in Egypt in ancient times.\"<ref>Daniel Zohary and Maria Hopf, ''Domestication of plants in the Old World'', third edition (Oxford: University Press, 2000), p. 165</ref>\n\nAlthough this species of fig requires the presence of the [[symbiotic]] [[wasp]] ''[[Ceratosolen arabicus]]'' to reproduce sexually, and this insect is extinct in Egypt, Zohay and Hopf have no doubt that Egypt was \"the principal area of sycamore fig development.\"{{clarify|date=February 2013}} Some of the caskets of mummies in [[Egypt]] are made from the wood of this tree. In tropical areas where the wasp is common, complex mini-ecosystems involving the wasp, nematodes, other parasitic wasps, and various larger predators revolve around the life cycle of the fig. The trees' random production of fruit in such environments assures its constant attendance by the insects and animals which form this ecosystem.\n\nA study in 2015 indicated that the sycamore tree was brought to Israel by [[Philistines]] during the Iron Age, along with [[opium poppy]] and [[cumin]].<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/08/150828112741.htm Philistines introduced sycamore, cumin and opium poppy into Israel during the Iron Age]. http://www.nature.com/articles/srep13308; sciencedaily.com, 28 August 2015 (retrieved on 25 October 2015)</ref>\n\n===Gardens===\nIn the [[Near East]] ''F. sycomorus'' is an orchard and [[ornamental tree]] of great importance and very extensive use. It has wide-spreading branches and affords shade.\n\n==In religion==\n\n===Judaism and Christianity===\nIn the [[Bible]], the sycomore is referred to seven times in the Old Testament [Hebrew \u05e9\u05e7\u05de\u05d4 ''shiqmah''; Strong's number 8256) and once in the New Testament (Greek \u03c3\u03c5\u03ba\u03bf\u03bc\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03b1 ''sycomorea''; Strong's number 4809).

[[Warwick (bass guitar)|Warwick Bass]] and Ibanez are known to use Bubinga and [[Guibourtia ehie|Ovangkol]]. It has been used in [[drum]] shells as well.

Bubinga comes in various grain patterns, with rare patterns bringing top dollar.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nEuropean knife makers sometimes use terms Bubinga and African Rosewood interchangeably when referring to ''Guibourtia demeusei'', which their knife handles are sometimes made of. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nBubinga is also used in the manufacture of a medium-end tobacco pipe marketed by Raw Papers.

It is considered to be an effective [[anthelmintic]] for [[pork tapeworm]] (''Taenia solium'').{{medcn|date=November 2014}} In its anthelmintic action it is similar to [[Male Fern]] (''Dryopteris filix-mas'').{{medcn|date=November 2014}}\n\nUse of Kosso was borrowed from Ethiopia, where as [[Richard Pankhurst (academic)|Richard Pankhurst]] quotes [[Paul Merab|Merab]] as saying that \"to mention it was to cover a quarter of that country's pharmacopeia.\"<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''An Introduction to the Medical History of Ethiopia'' (Trenton: Red Sea Press, 1990), p. 104</ref> However, its primary use was, well into the 19th century, to combat human tapeworm infestations, which was endemic due to widespread consumption of dishes containing raw beef, such as [[kitfo]] and [[gored gored]]. Frequent doses of kosso, about once every two months, was the common cure. Richard Pankhurst cites numerous examples of this practice, noting that \"the two-monthly event virtually constituted a holiday for the patient, who withdrew from all normal activity, the statement 'the master has taken his ''kosso'',' being synonymous with 'he cannot receive you today.' ''Kosso''-drinking in fact served as an excuse or justification for not keeping appointments, being used by the debtor who did not wish to meet his creditor, by the accused who wished to avoid going to court, and by the official who sought to delay answering the Emperor's summons.\"<ref>Richard Pankhurst, ''Economic History of Ethiopia'' (Addis Ababa: Haile Selassie I University, 1968), p. 631.</ref>\n\nKosso or \u12ae\u1236 in Amharic is also the name of the human tapeworm, ''[[Taenia saginata]]''.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Eriksson, T., Hibbs, M.

The Doum Palm can produce up to thousands of fruit per tree, each fruit growing 6\u201312&nbsp;cm long and 4\u20139&nbsp;cm wide.<ref name=\"miti\" />\n\n== Usage of Tree ==\nAlmost all of the East African Doum Palm can be utilised, the most highly used part of the tree being its leaves.<ref name=\"amwatta\" />  ''Hyphaene compressa'' has a variety of different uses and is a vital economic resource in rural African communities.\n\n=== Leaves ===\nThe age the palm leaves are harvested dictate what goods are produced.<ref name=\"amwatta\" />\nThe stalks of immature palm leaves are split into long strips to make a variety of products such as baskets, mats, chairs, brooms and hats. The leaves can also be beaten and separated into fibers to make hammocks.<ref name=\"amwatta\" /> Mature green leaves are dried and used to cover the roofs of huts, make fire and to also create weaved goods. The uses for these leaves as shelter have expanded to include tourist sites and refugee camps and also with the increase in more permanent settlements in African communities.<ref name=\"amwatta\" />\n\n=== Fruits ===\nThe people of Eastern Africa depend on the fruit from the Doum Palm ''Hyphaene compressa'' in different ways. It is popular as a food source, more so during times of food shortage, and is commonly bought and sold in local markets <ref name=\"biovision\" /> The [[mesocarp]] or pulp of the young fruit can be made into a non-alcoholic juice drink which children enjoy.<ref name=\"amwatta\" /> The seed coat within the mesocarp is hard to crack but the nut inside can be eaten or crushed into a powder to flavor other food items.<ref name=\"miti\" />\n\n=== Stems ===\nBy incising the stems of older trees, its sap can be made into an alcoholic wine of about 3.6 volume %.<ref name=\"miti\" /> This practice is often performed incorrectly by cutting into the stem too deeply which kills the tree. Although, if the sap is extracted correctly, the tree is viable for an additional two to three years.<ref name=\"miti\" /> The wines 24hour expiration time and lack of investment into preservation has kept it lost from being economically important.<ref name=\"miti\" /> The trunks before the first branching can be made into very sturdy, termite proof building material that includes poles, fences and latrines.<ref name=\"miti\" /> Although the fellow Coconut Palm [[Cocos (genus)|Cocos]] in the same family of Palms has been very popular as an exported building good, the East African Doum Palm is claimed to be sturdier because of its higher density timber.<ref name=\"miti\" />\n\n=== Additional Names ===\nThe East African Doum Palm has many different names in native African languages. \nBoni (Medi); Chonyi (Mkoma); Digo (Mkoma lume); Gabra (Meetti); Giriama (Mlala); Kamba (Mukoma); Kambe (Mkoma); Mbeere (Irara); Orma (Kone); Pokomo (Mkoma); Pokot (Tangayiween); Rendile (Baar); Samburu (Iparwa); Sanya (Auwaki); Somali (Baar); Swahili (Mkoma, Mlala); Taveta (Irara); Tharaka (Muruguyu); Turkana (Eeng'ol) <ref name=\"biovision\" />\n\n== Socioeconomic Importance ==\nThe presence of the Doum Palm ''Hyphaene compressa'' has increased living standards in rural communities in which the fruit, leaves and stems are monetarily valuable.<ref name=\"amwatta\" /> Weaved products are sold and traded at local and international markets <ref name=\"amwatta\" /> where extreme specificity of skill and craftsmanship can be seen. Subsequently the marketing and distribution of thatched products creates a niche that requires retailers, wholesales and of course local manufacturers that understand the changing local market. For example in Turkana, a women\u2019s co-operative society has emerged to handle the sales of crafts.<ref name=\"amwatta\" /> Although the East African Doum Palm has created a source of income for local peoples it is important to note that its economy is not stable or uniform throughout the region. Availability to ''Hyphaene compressa'', ability to effectively utilize its product and skills of the regional people are all limiting factors.<ref name=\"amwatta\" />\n\n== Conservation ==\nDue to the high importance of the ''Hyphaene compressa'' poaching of its leaves in protected National Forests has become an issue. There has been evidence since the 1990s of overexploitation of the trees resources.<ref name=\"amwatta\" /> Improper sap collection practices kill Palm trees and lack of knowledge on how to perform extraction is limiting the Palms longevity. ''Hyphaene compressa'' is in the process of being domesticated in some regions in Africa. Conservation laws to protect the tree from being overexploited have also been locally established as to ensure there is a lasting abundance of the East African Doum Palm.<ref name=\"amwatta\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxbmz6SFjtg YouTube news video]\n\n[[Category:Hyphaene|compressa]]\n[[Category:Trees of Africa]]",

All parts of the tree are useful, but probably the most important product is the leaves. The fibre and leaflets are used by people along the Niger and Nile Rivers to weave baskets, such as in the [[material culture of the Manasir]]. Other things made from the leaves are mats, coarse textiles, brooms, ropes, string and thatch.<ref name=Agroforestry/> The timber is used for posts and poles, furniture manufacture and beehives, and the tree provides wood for fuel. The leaf stalks are used for fencing and the fibre is used for textiles. Other products include fishing rafts, brooms, hammocks, carpets, buttons and beads.<ref name=Infonet>{{cite web|url=http://www.infonet-biovision.org/default/ct/748/agroforestry |title=Doum palm |date=2011-08-08 |publisher=Infonet Biovision |accessdate=2014-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919171821/http://www.infonet-biovision.org/default/ct/748/agroforestry |archivedate=2012-09-19 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Food===\nThe doum palm fruit-dates are also known in [[Eritrea]] as Akat, or Akaat in the [[Tigre language]].  The thin dried brown [[peel (fruit)|rind]] is made into [[molasses]], [[cakes]], and [[sweetmeats]].  The unripe kernels are edible.  The shoots of the germinated seeds are also eaten as a vegetable.<ref>Facciola, S., ''Cornucopia, A Source Book of Edible Plants'' Kampong.</ref> In [[Egypt]], the fruit is sold in herbalist shops, and is popular among children, gnawing its sweet yet sour hard fibrous flesh beneath the shiny hard crust. In [[Diu, India|Diu]], [[Una, Gujarat|Una]] and [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] region of [[Gujarat]] (India), the tree is known as ''Hoka Tree'' and the red ripe edible fruit is known as ''Hoka''. In northern part of Nigeria, among the [[Hausa people]], it's known as \"Goruba\". Apart from the use of the fruit as food, juice is extracted from the young fruit and palm wine is prepared from the sap.<ref name=Infonet/>\n\n===Medicinal uses===\nThe fruit of the doum palm has been used in folk medicine to treat hypertension. In a trial, a group of patients with raised blood pressure were all given an antihypertensive drug but in half the individuals, this was supplemented with doum fruit extract. It was found that those receiving the supplement had lower systolic and diastolic pressures and lower total cholesterol, and the blood lipids and lipoproteins were changed in such a way as to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=El-Gendy, A. |author2=El-Mileegy, A. |author3=Ghyaty, E. |author4=Malek, H. |author5=El-Hamid Mousa, A. |year=2008 |title=The Beneficial Dietary Hypotensive and Hypolipidaemic Effects of Hyphaene Thebaica ( Doum ) |journal=Internet Journal of Alternative Medicine |volume=7 |issue=1 |url=http://ispub.com/IJAM/7/1/5592 }}</ref>\n\n===Egyptian tombs===\nDoum palm was considered sacred by the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, and the seed was found in many pharaoh's tombs.

It is a [[evergreen]] [[tree]] or [[shrub]] found, for example, in shady areas of forests of [[oak]] and in [[beech]] [[hedge]]s. It has a great capacity to adapt to different conditions and is a pioneer species that repopulates the margins of forests or clearcuts.\n\nAs a tree, Christmas holly can exceed 10 m in height. It is usually found as a shrub or a small tree about 1 m tall with a straight [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] and pyramidal [[crown (botany)|crown]], which branches from the base. It grows slowly and does not usually fully mature due to grazing, cutting, or fire. It can live 500 years, but usually does not reach 100.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Acebo.jpg|thumb|European holly foliage with berries]]\n[[File:Hollyflowers.jpg|thumb|European holly flowers; male above, female below (leaves cut to show flowers more clearly)]]\nHolly is an [[evergreen]] tree growing to 10\u201325&nbsp;m tall with a woody stem as large as 40\u201380&nbsp;cm, rarely 1 m or more, in diameter The [[leaf|leaves]] are 5\u201312&nbsp;cm long and 2\u20136&nbsp;cm broad; they are evergreen, lasting about five years, and are dark green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, oval, leathery, shiny, and about 5 to 9&nbsp;cm long. In the young and in the lower limbs of mature trees, the leaves have three to five sharp spines on each side, pointing alternately upward and downward, while leaves of the upper branches in mature trees lack spines.<ref name=rushforth/><ref name=fnwe/>\n\nThe [[flower]]s are white, four-lobed, and pollinated by [[bee]]s. Holly is [[Glossary of botanical terms#dioecious|dioecious]], meaning that there are male plants and female plants. The sex cannot be determined until the plants begin flowering, usually between 4 and 12 years of age. In male specimens, the flowers are yellowish and appear in [[Axillary bud|axillary]] groups. In the female, flowers are isolated or in groups of three and are small and white or slightly pink, and consist of four petals and four sepals partially fused at the base.\n\nThe [[fruit]] is a red [[drupe]], about 6\u201310&nbsp;mm in diameter, a bright red or bright yellow, which matures around October or November; at this time they are very bitter due to the [[ilicin]] content<ref name=Hoppe>{{cite book | first=Heinz, A. |last=Hoppe |date=1975 |title=Drogenkunde |publisher=W. de Gruyter |isbn=3-13-566001-X }}</ref> and so are rarely eaten until late winter after [[frost]] has made them softer and more palatable.

It requires moist, shady environments, found within forests or in shady slopes, cliffs, and mountain gorges.<ref name = fe/><ref name=mc/><ref name=rushforth/>\n\nAlong the west coast of the United States, from California to British Columbia, non-native English Holly has proved very invasive, quickly spreading into native forest habitat, where it thrives in shade and crowds out native species. It has been placed on the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board's monitor list, and is a Class C invasive plant in Portland.<ref>http://www.nwcb.wa.gov/weeds/english-holly</ref><ref>http://bcinvasives.ca/invasive-species/identify/invasive-species/invasive-plants/english-holly/</ref><ref name=\"Cal-IPC\">{{cite web| url=http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/management/plant_profiles/Ilex_aquifolium.php |title=''Ilex aquifolium'' (English holly)| publisher=California Invasive Plant Council| accessdate=2016-10-02}}</ref><ref>https://www.portlandoregon.gov/auditor/34460?a=322280</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Cenozoic Era]], the Mediterranean region, Europe, and northwest Africa had a wetter climate and were largely covered by [[laurel forest]]s. Holly was a typical representative species of this [[biome]], where many current species of the genus ''Ilex'' were present. With the [[Messinian salinity crisis|drying of the Mediterranean Basin]] during the [[Pliocene]], the laurel forests gradually retreated, replaced by more [[drought]]-tolerant [[sclerophyll]] plant communities. The modern ''Ilex aquifolium'' resulted from this change.{{clarification needed|reason=does this refer to the modern distribution or the modern species?|date=February 2017}}{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Most of the last remaining laurel forests around the Mediterranean are believed to have died out approximately 10,000 years ago at the end of the [[Pleistocene]].\n\n==Ecology==\nHolly is a rugged pioneer species that prefers relatively moist areas, and tolerates frost as well as summer drought. The plant is common in the [[garrigue]] and [[maquis shrubland|maquis]] and is also found in deciduous forest and oak forest.\n\nPure stands of hollies can grow into a labyrinth of vaults in which [[thrush (bird)|thrushes]] and [[deer]] take refuge, while smaller birds are protected among their spiny leaves. After the first frost of the season, holly fruits become soft and fall to the ground serving as important food for winter birds at a time of scarce resources.\n\nThe flowers are attractive as nectar sources for insects such as bees, wasps, flies, and small butterflies.\n\nIt is an [[invasive species]] on the West Coast of the United States and Hawaii.<ref name=\"Cal-IPC\"/><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.kingcounty.gov/environment/animalsAndPlants/noxious-weeds/weed-identification/english-holly.aspx| title=English Holly - ''Ilex aquifolium''| publisher=[[King County, Washington]]| accessdate=2011-01-30}}</ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\n[[File:2014-11-02 15 43 09 English Holly along Glen Mawr Drive in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|thumb|Cultivated specimen in North America]]\n[[File:2014-08-29 13 46 38 Variegated English Holly at the Pinelands Preservation Alliance headquarters in Southampton Township, New Jersey.JPG|thumb|One of several variegated cultivars]]\n''Ilex aquifolium'', the familiar holly of Christmas cards and wreaths, is widely grown in parks and gardens in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions.

It inhabits [[mangrove]] forests.\n\nThe tree has a variety of common names including '''ipil''', '''merbau''' and '''kwila'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unep-wcmc.org/trees/trade/int_bij.htm|title=Tree Conservation Information Service|date=2007-09-05|publisher=UNEP-WCMC|accessdate=2008-08-23}}</ref>  In the [[Philippines]], it also known in some areas as '''taal'''.<ref name=JETE>{{Cite-JETE|Ipil, taal}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nThe bark and leaves of the ipil are used in traditional medicines. The tree's timber, called ''merbau'' or ''kwila'', is a very durable and [[termite]]-resistant wood, making it a highly valued material for flooring and other uses.  The wood can also be used to extract a dye.   Merbau can contain a \"gold\" fleck that runs through the grain, considered to be attractive by some.\nDue to extensive logging of the tree, it is endangered in many places in Southeast Asia, and almost extinct in some.<ref>[http://www.wildsingapore.com/chekjawa/text/f106.htm Wild Singapore]</ref> Extensive amounts were purchased for the venue of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in China, which is the largest importer of the wood.<ref name=BBC>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6277518.stm|title=China trade threatens tropical trees|last=Bristow |first=Michael |date=2007-07-06|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The wood is used for flooring in U.S. and European markets where it is commonly sold under different names.  Both licensed and unlicensed mills harvest the wood.\n\n==Illegal logging==\nAccording to [[Greenpeace]] large amounts of ipil timber sourced from [[illegal logging]] is being imported into [[China]] where there are lax import rules. Greenpeace are targeting users in Western countries in order to halt the trade in ipil wood. Greenpeace claims that at the current rate of logging the tree will be wiped out within 35 years.<ref name=BBC/>\n\nIn [[New Zealand]], where the ipil wood is known as kwila, attempts have been made to stop it from being imported. In 2008 retailers were divided in whether the sale of kwila should be banned. [[Jim Anderton]], who was the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (New Zealand)|Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry]] at that time, did not support a ban and instead he left it up to consumer choice.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/environment/news/article.cfm?c_id=39&objectid=10527536|title=Stores divided over calls to ban kwila|last=Gibson|first=Eloise|date=18 August 2008|work=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Symbolism==\n''Intsia bijuga'', locally known as ''ifit'', is the official tree of the [[United States territory]] of [[Guam]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{AustTRFPK6.1 |url= http://keys.trin.org.au:8080/key-server/data/0e0f0504-0103-430d-8004-060d07080d04/media/Html/taxon/Intsia_bijuga.htm |name= Intsia bijuga |accessdate= 16 Mar 2013}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/planet-2/report/2008/7/merbau-report-2.pdf|title=Merbau\u2019s Last Stand|author1=Sze Pang Cheung |author2=Tiy Chung |author3=Tamara Stark |date=17 April 2007|publisher=Greenpeace International, Amsterdam}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sihite|first=Jamartin,|title=Bintuni Bay Nature Reserve Management Plan - Irian Jaya Barat Province 2006-2030|url=http://www.coral-triangle.org/downloads/Bintuni_english_screen.pdf |date=August 2005|publisher=The Nature Conservancy|isbn=979-97700-3-3}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*{{commons category|Intsia bijuga|position=left}}\n*{{wikispecies-inline}}\n*[http://anasia.info/en/img/CIRAD-Merbau.pdf CIRAD Forestry Department \u2014 timber data]\n\n[[Category:Intsia|bijuga]]\n[[Category:Trees of Africa]]\n[[Category:Trees of Indo-China]]\n[[Category:Trees of Malesia]]\n[[Category:Trees of Papuasia]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Pacific]]\n[[Category:Trees of India]]\n[[Category:Trees of Madagascar]]\n[[Category:Trees of Papua New Guinea]]\n[[Category:Trees of Seychelles]]\n[[Category:Trees of Taiwan]]\n[[Category:Flora of Southeast Asia]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Zanzibar Archipelago]]\n[[Category:Fabales of Australia]]\n[[Category:Trees of Australia]]\n[[Category:Flora of Queensland]]\n[[Category:Vulnerable biota of Queensland]]\n[[Category:Vulnerable flora of Australia]]\n[[Category:Vulnerable flora of Asia]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1891]]",

The shrub's flowers are produced on short axillary [[Cyme (botany)#Determinate or Cymose|cymes]] that are 4\u20138&nbsp;cm in length. Each flower is small, with five white petals. The [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] fruit is an oblong, three-valved capsule, which contains one to three seeds.\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[Image:Khat fields in western yemen.jpg|thumb|Khat cultivation in western [[Yemen]] near [[At Tawilah]]]]\n[[File:Qat tree,yemen.jpg|thumb|Qat tree, Yemen]]\n[[File:Yemeni eating qat.jpg|thumb|Yemeni eating qat]]\nThe khat plant is known by a variety of names, such as ''qat'' and ''gat'' in [[Yemen]], ''qaat'' and ''jaad'' in [[Somalia]], and ''chat'' in [[Ethiopia]].<ref name=\"Kciy\" /> It is also known as ''jimaa'' in the [[Oromo language|Oromo]] language and mayirungi in  [[Luganda]] Language. Khat has been grown for use as a stimulant for centuries in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. There, chewing khat predates the use of coffee and is used in a similar social context. In Uganda it is grown in Central region, kasenge Nakawuka road and some parts of Western region of the Country .<ref name=\"Kciy\"/> In Kenya it is grown in Meru County.\n \nAlthough the practice of khat-chewing is still primarily restricted to its original area of cultivation in the [[Red Sea]] area,<ref name=\"Kciy\"/> the khat plant has over the years found its way to [[Southern Africa]] as well as tropical areas, where it grows on rocky outcrops and in woodlands. The shrub is today scattered in the [[KwaZulu-Natal]], [[Eastern Cape]], [[Western Cape]] and [[Mpumalanga]] provinces of [[South Africa]], in addition to [[Swaziland]] and [[Mozambique]].<ref name=\"Pzce\">{{cite web|title=Catha edulis |url=http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantcd/cathedulis.htm |publisher=Plantzafrica |accessdate=15 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nIts fresh leaves and tops are chewed or, less frequently, dried and consumed as tea, to achieve a state of euphoria and stimulation; it also has [[anorectic]] (appetite-reducing) side effects. The leaves or the soft part of the stem can be chewed with either chewing gum or fried peanuts to make it easier to chew. In recent years, however, improved roads, off-road motor vehicles, and air transportation have increased the global distribution of this perishable commodity, and as a result, the plant has been reported in England, Wales, Rome, [[Amsterdam]], Canada, Israel, Australia, New Zealand,<ref name=\"NZ_Herald_10415187\">{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10415187 |title=Concerns over African methamphetamine-like drug in Hamilton |first=O'Rourke |last=Simon |date=13 December 2006 |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 October 2011}}</ref> and the United States.

It may also be used by farmers and labourers for reducing physical fatigue or hunger, and by drivers and students for improving attention.\n\nIt takes seven to eight years for the khat plant to reach its full height. Other than access to sun and water, khat requires little maintenance. Ground water is often pumped from deep wells by diesel engines to irrigate the crops, or brought in by water trucks. The plants are watered heavily starting around a month before they are harvested to make the leaves and stems soft and moist. A good khat plant can be harvested four times a year, providing a year-long source of income for the farmer.\n\n==Health effects==\n[[File:Rational harm assessment of drugs radar plot.svg|thumb|Addiction experts in psychiatry, chemistry, pharmacology, forensic science, epidemiology, and the police and legal services engaged in [[Delphi method|delphic analysis]] regarding 20 popular recreational drugs.

However, the attribution was disputed by reports showing the plant extracts from fresh leaves contained another substance more behaviourally active than cathine. In 1975, the related alkaloid [[cathinone]] was isolated, and its [[absolute configuration]] was established in 1978. Cathinone is not very stable and breaks down to produce cathine and [[norephedrine]]. These chemicals belong to the [[phenylpropanolamine|PPA (phenylpropanolamine)]] family, a subset of the [[Substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamines]] related to [[amfetamine|amphetamines]] and the [[catecholamine]]s [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]].<ref name=\"drugs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/npp/khat.html |title=Complete Khat Info |author=Drugs.com |date=1 January 2007}}</ref> In fact, cathinone and cathine have a very similar molecular structure to amphetamine.<ref name=\"cox2003\">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1192/apt.9.6.456 |title=Adverse effects of khat: a review |year=2003 |last1=Cox |first1=G. |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=456\u201363}}</ref> Khat is sometimes confused with [[methcathinone]] (also known as ''cat''), a Schedule I substance that possesses a similar chemical structure to the khat plant's cathinone active component.

Thus, harvesters transport khat by packaging the leaves and stems in plastic bags or wrapping them in banana leaves to preserve their moisture and keep the cathinone potent. It is also common for them to sprinkle the plant with water frequently or use refrigeration during transportation.\n\nWhen the khat leaves are chewed, cathine and cathinone are released and absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth as well as the lining of the stomach. The action of cathine and cathinone on the [[reuptake]] of [[epinephrine]] and norepinephrine has been demonstrated in lab animals, showing that one or both of these chemicals cause(s) the body to recycle these neurotransmitters more slowly, resulting in the wakefulness and insomnia associated with khat use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ahmed |first1=M.B. |last2=El-Qirbi |first2=A.B. |title=Biochemical effects of Catha edulis, cathine and cathinone on adrenocortical functions |journal=J Ethnopharmacol |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=213\u20136 |date=August 1993 |pmid=7903110 |doi=10.1016/0378-8741(93)90039-8}}</ref>\n\nReceptors for [[serotonin]] show a high affinity for cathinone, suggesting this chemical is responsible for feelings of euphoria associated with chewing khat.

These leaves are chewed, and act upon the spirits of those using them, much as a strong dose of green tea acts upon us in Europe, when it acts agreeably.

It is known by a number of other common names, including '''Nyasaland''', '''Red''' or '''White mahogany'''. Oos-Afrikaanse mahonie is the [[Afrikaans]] name and Acaujo is its name in [[French language|French]].\n\n==Distribution==\nIt is widespread, occurring from [[Guinea Bissau]] east to [[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]], and south to [[Angola]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Mozambique]]. It is fairly widely grown in plantations within its natural area of distribution, but also in South Africa, tropical Asia and tropical America. It is easily confused with other ''Khaya'' species like ''[[Khaya grandifoliola|K. grandifoliola]]'', ''[[Khaya senegalensis|K. senegalensis]]'' or  ''[[Khaya ivorensis|K. ivorensis]]'' in the north of its natural range.\n\n===Habitat===\nThe East African mahogany grows in medium to low altitude areas in evergreen forests. They require damp lands in order to grow. The [[Big Tree in Chirinda Forest|Big Tree]] in [[Chirinda Forest Botanical Reserve|Chirinda Forest]] is the tallest native tree in [[Zimbabwe]].\n\n==Description==\n''Khaya anthotheca'' trees may grow between {{convert|30|to|60|m}} tall. They have greyish-brown bark. \n\nOn mature trees, white scented flowers are borne at the ends of the branches. \n\n==Common uses==\nIt is used for furniture, flooring, paneling and boat building. It is a very suitable tree for these projects because the bark weathers well, is resistant to [[woodboring beetles|borers]] and [[termite]]s, besides fungal decay, and is tough but saws well. The bark has a bitter taste which is often used as a medicine for common colds. The oil from the seeds can also be rubbed into a person's scalp to rid of insects and lice.\n\n==Threats== \nIt is often cut down and destroyed in East and West Africa. Planting new trees in these areas to make up for what was destroyed is very rare. [[Genetic erosion]] is thought to have occurred as well. Because of this, the species is listed as \"vulnerable\" on the [[IUCN Red List]]. Some of its populations have been offered protection, and some countries placed bans on its export. The foliage is eaten by the larvae of the moth ''[[Heteronygmia dissimilis]]''.<ref name=Capinera>{{cite book|author=Capinera, John L. |title=Encyclopedia of Entomology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&pg=PA68 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-1-4020-6242-1 |pages=68\u201370}}</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n{{reflist}}\n* Hawthorne, W. 1998.

The genus comprises only one species, '''''Kigelia africana''''', which occurs throughout tropical [[Africa]] from [[Eritrea]] and [[Chad]] south to northern [[South Africa]], and west to [[Senegal]] and [[Namibia]]. The Kigelia grows a fruit that grows up to 2 feet long, weighs about 15 lbs, and looks like sausage.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Leaves I IMG 4112.jpg|left|thumb|Leaf in [[Kolkata]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]]]]\n[[File:Kigeliaflower.JPG|thumb|Flower]]\n[[File:Kigelia-Africana-Fruit.JPG|thumb|Sausage tree fruit]]\n[[File:Kigelia africana Bark.jpg|thumb|Bark in [[Kolkata]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]]]]\nThe genus name comes from the Mozambican [[Bantu language|Bantu]] name, ''kigeli-keia'', while the common names '''sausage tree'''<ref name=Saini>{{cite journal|url=http://nopr.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/4043/1/NPR%208(2)%20190-197.pdf|title=''Kigelia africana'' (Lam.)

Its name in [[Afrikaans]] ''worsboom'' also means sausage tree, and its [[Arabic]] name means \"the father of kit bags\" (Roodt 1992).\n\n==Growth==\nIt is a [[tree]] growing up to 20 m tall. The bark is grey and smooth at first, peeling on older trees. It can be as thick as 6&nbsp;mm on a 15-cm branch (Roodt 1992). The wood is pale brown or yellowish, undifferentiated and not prone to cracking (Roodt 1992).\n\nThe tree is [[evergreen]] where rainfall occurs throughout the year, but [[deciduous]] where there is a long [[dry season]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] are opposite or in whorls of three, 30\u201350&nbsp;cm long, [[pinnate]], with six to ten oval leaflets up to 20&nbsp;cm long and 6&nbsp;cm broad; the terminal leaflet can be either present or absent. The [[flower]]s (and later the fruit) hang down from branches on long flexible stems (2-6 metres long). Flowers are produced in [[panicle]]s; they are bell-shaped (similar to those of the [[Spathodea|African tulip tree]] but darker and more waxy), orange to reddish or purplish green, and about 10&nbsp;cm wide. Individual flowers do not hang down but are oriented horizontally. Some birds are attracted to these flowers and the strong stems of each flower make ideal footholds. Their scent is most notable at night indicating that they are adapted to pollination by [[bat]]s, which visit them for pollen and nectar. They also remain open by day however, and are freely visited by many insect pollinators, particularly large species such as carpenter bees. \n\nThe [[fruit]] is a woody [[berry (botany)|berry]] from 30\u2013100&nbsp;cm long and up to 18&nbsp;cm broad; typically it weighs between 5 and 10&nbsp;kg, and hangs down on long, rope-like [[peduncle (botany)|peduncles]]. The fruit pulp is fibrous and pulpy, and contains numerous [[seed]]s. It is eaten by several species of [[mammal]]s, including [[baboon]]s, [[bushpig]]s, [[savannah elephant]]s, [[giraffe]]s, [[hippopotamus]]es, [[monkey]]s, and [[Old World porcupine|porcupines]]. The seeds are dispersed in their dung. The seeds are also eaten by [[brown parrot]]s and [[brown-headed parrot]]s, and the foliage by elephants and [[greater kudu]] (Joffe 2003; del Hoyo et al. 1997). Introduced specimens in Australian parks are very popular with [[cockatoo]]s. The trees are also found in large numbers in Ingraham Institute NH-24 campus, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh in India. Whether it is the same species has not yet been verified.\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\nAn alcoholic beverage similar to [[beer]] is also made from it. The fresh fruit is [[poison]]ous and strongly [[purgative]]; fruit are prepared for consumption by drying, roasting or fermentation (Joffe 2003; McBurney 2004). In Botswana the timber is used for [[makoro]]s, yokes and oars (Roodt 1992). ''Kigelia'' is also used in a number of skin care products.\n\nPlanting sites should be selected carefully, as the falling fruit can cause serious injury to people, and damage vehicles parked under the trees.\nThe tree is widely grown as an [[Ornamental plant|ornamental tree]] in tropical regions for its decorative flowers and unusual fruit.\n\n==Vernacular names==\n\nIn [[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]]: ''muratina''; [[Swahili language|Swahili]]: ''mbungati'', ''mwegea'', ''mnyegea'', ''mvongonya'';<ref>''Standard Swahili Dictionary'' Oxford University Press, date unknown</ref> [[Hindi]] ''balam kheera'', ''hathi bailan''; [[Luo languages|Luo]] ''yago''; [[Malayalam]] ''shiva kundalam''; [[Tamil language|Tamil]] ''yaanai pudukan''; and [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] ''pandoro''.\n[[Tugen_people|Tugen]](kalenjin tribe): Rotinwo\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Kigelia africana -flower.JPG|''Kigelia africana'' flower at [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], in [[Puducherry]], [[ India]]\nFile:Leaves on the tree Im IMG 4108.jpg|Leaves on the tree  in [[Kolkata]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]]\nFile:Flower bud I IMG 4104.jpg|Flower bud in [[Kolkata]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]].\nFile:Sausage Tree in Botswana.JPG |A sausage tree in [[Botswana]] in use as an airport departure lounge\nFile:Seeds and husk of Kigelia africana.JPG|Seeds and husk of a broken fruit\nFile:Kigelia africana - sausage tree.JPG|''Kigelia africana'' - sausage tree\nFile:Kigelia Africana with fruits, Trinidad.JPG|''Kigelia africana'' with unripe fruits: campus of UWI, Trinidad, Feb. 2015\nFile:Kigelia Africana.JPG|''Kigelia africana'': campus of U.

With the drying of the Mediterranean during the [[Pliocene]] era, the laurel forests gradually retreated, and were replaced by the more drought-tolerant [[sclerophyll]] plant communities familiar today. Most of the last remaining laurel forests around the Mediterranean are believed to have disappeared approximately ten thousand years ago, although some remnants still persist in the mountains of southern Turkey, northern Syria, southern Spain, north-central Portugal, northern Morocco, Canary Islands and in [[Madeira]].\n\n==Chemical constituents==\nThe most abundant component found in laurel [[essential oil]] is [[1,8-cineole]], also called eucalyptol. The leaves contain about 1.3% essential oils (''ol. lauri folii''), consisting of 45% eucalyptol, 12% other [[terpene]]s, 8-12% [[terpinyl acetate]], 3\u20134% [[sesquiterpene]]s, 3% [[methyleugenol]], and other \u03b1- and \u03b2-[[pinene]]s, [[phellandrene]], [[linalool]], [[geraniol]], and [[terpineol]], contains [[lauric acid]] also.<ref>AYBEN KILIC, HARZEMSAH HAFIZOGLU, HUBERT KOLLMANNSBERGER, AND SIEGFRIED NITZ (2004). Volatile Constituents and Key Odorants in Leaves, Buds, Flowers, and Fruits of Laurus nobilis L.

The fruit contains up to 30% fatty oils and about 1% essential oils (terpenes, sesquiterpenes, [[alcohol]]s, and [[ketone]]s).\n\n==Human uses==\n\n===Food===\nThe plant is the source of several popular [[herbs]] and one [[spice]] used in a wide variety of recipes, particularly among Mediterranean cuisines.<ref name=Oxford>Vaughan, p.150.</ref> Most commonly, the aromatic [[Bay leaf|leaves]] are added whole to Italian pasta sauces.

It is short and squat, and rarely exceeds {{convert|8|-|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height. The ''Pisciottana'', a unique variety comprising 40,000 trees found only in the area around [[Pisciotta]] in the [[Campania]] region of southern [[Italy]] often exceeds this, with correspondingly large trunk diameters. The silvery green [[leaf|leaves]] are oblong, measuring {{convert|4|\u2013|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|\u2013|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The trunk is typically gnarled and twisted.\n\nThe small white, feathery [[flower]]s, with ten-cleft [[sepal|calyx]] and [[petal|corolla]], two [[stamen]]s and bifid [[carpel|stigma]], are borne generally on the previous year's wood, in [[raceme]]s springing from the [[axil]]s of the leaves.\n\nThe [[fruit]] is a small [[drupe]] {{convert|1|\u2013|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, thinner-fleshed and smaller in wild plants than in orchard cultivars. Olives are harvested in the green to purple stage. Canned black olives have often been artificially blackened (see below on processing) and may contain the chemical [[ferrous gluconate]] to improve the appearance. ''Olea europaea'' contains a seed commonly referred to in American English as a pit or a rock, and in British English as a stone.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThere are six natural subspecies of ''Olea europaea'' distributed over a wide range:<ref name=j2/><ref name=j3/>\n\n*''Olea europaea'' subsp.

Yeast-dominated fermentations produce a different suite of metabolites which provide poorer preservation, so they are corrected with an acid such as citric acid in the final processing stage to provide microbial stability.<ref name=\"Fern\u00e1ndez, A.

The most important commercial examples are:\n\n'''Spanish or Sevillian type''' (olives with fermentation). Most commonly applied to green olive preparation.

They are usually considered \"treated\" when the lye has penetrated two-thirds of the way into the fruit. They are then washed once or several times in water to remove the caustic solution and transferred to fermenting vessels full of brine at typical concentrations of 8\u201312% NaCl.<ref>University of Catania PhD in Food Science and Technology, Food Microbiology: \"Isolation and characterization of yeasts isolated from naturally fermented olives with brine bioprotective function\"  Laboratory of Food Microbiology, DISPA, Agrarian Faculty.</ref> The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds. Fermentation is carried out by the natural microbiota present on the olives that survive the lye treatment process. Many organisms are involved, usually reflecting the local conditions or \"Terroir\" of the olives. During a typical fermentation gram-negative enterobacteria flourish in small numbers at first, but are rapidly outgrown by lactic acid bacteria species such as ''Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis'' and ''Pediococcus damnosus''. These bacteria produce lactic acid to help lower the pH of the brine and therefore stabilize the product against unwanted pathogenic species. A diversity of yeasts then accumulate in sufficient numbers to help complete the fermentation alongside the lactic acid bacteria. Yeasts commonly mentioned include the teleomorphs ''Pichia anomala, Pichia membranifaciens, Debaryomyces hansenii'' and ''Kluyveromyces marxianus''.<ref name=\"Fern\u00e1ndez, A. Garrido 1997\"/> Once fermented, the olives are placed in fresh brine and acid corrected, to be ready for market.\n\n'''Sicilian or Greek type''' (olives with fermentation). Applied to green, semi-ripe and ripe olives. Almost identical to the Spanish type fermentation process, however the lye treatment process is skipped and the olives are placed directly in fermentation vessels full of brine (8\u201312% NaCl). The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds. As the caustic treatment is avoided, lactic acid bacteria are only present in similar numbers to yeast and appear to be outcompeted by the abundant yeasts found on untreated olives. As there is very little acid produced by the yeast fermentation, lactic, acetic, or citric acid is often added to the fermentation stage to stabilize the process.<ref name=\"Kailis, Stanley G. 2007\"/>\n\n'''Picholine or directly-brined type''' (olives with fermentation). Can be applied to green, semi-ripe or ripe olives. Olives are soaked in lye typically for longer periods than Spanish style (e.g. 10\u201372 hours) until the solution has penetrated three-quarters of the way into the fruit. They are then washed and immediately brined and acid corrected with citric acid to achieve microbial stability. Fermentation still occurs carried out by acidogenic yeast and bacteria, but is more subdued than other methods. The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds and a series of progressively stronger concentrations of NaCl are added until the product is fully stabilized and ready to be eaten.<ref name=\"Fern\u00e1ndez, A. Garrido 1997\"/>\n\n'''Water-cured type''' (olives with fermentation). Can be applied to green, semi-ripe or ripe olives. Olives are soaked in water or weak brine and this solution is changed on a daily basis for 10\u201314 days. The oleuropein is naturally dissolved and leached into the water and removed during a continual soak-wash cycle. Fermentation takes place during the water treatment stage and involves a mixed yeast/bacteria ecosystem. Sometimes, the olives are lightly cracked with a hammer or a stone to trigger fermentation and speed up the fermentation process. Once debittered the olives are brined to concentrations of 8\u201312% NaCl and acid corrected, and are then ready to eat.<ref name=\"Kailis, Stanley G. 2007\"/>\n\n'''Salt-cured type''' (olives with minor fermentation). Applied only to ripe olives and usually produced in Morocco or Turkey and other eastern Mediterranean countries. Once picked, the olives are vigorously washed and packed in alternating layers with salt. The high concentrations of salt draw the moisture out of olives, dehydrating and shriveling them until they look somewhat analogous to a raisin. Once packed in salt, fermentation is minimal and only initiated by the most halophilic yeast species such as ''Debaryomyces hansenii''. Once cured, they are sold in their natural state without any additives.<ref name=\"Fern\u00e1ndez, A. Garrido 1997\"/> So-called '''Oil-cured olives''' are cured in salt, and then soaked in oil.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oil-Cured Olives: A Kalamata Substitute?|url=https://www.cooksillustrated.com/how_tos/9998-oil-cured-olives-a-kalamata-substitute|publisher=Cooks Illustrated|date=May 2016|accessdate=27 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''California or \"artificial ripening\" type''' (olives without fermentation). Applied to green and semi-ripe olives. Olives are placed in lye and soaked. Upon their removal they are washed in water injected with compressed air. This process is repeated several times until both oxygen and lye have soaked through to the pit. The repeated, saturated exposure to air oxidises the skin and flesh of the fruit, turning it black in an artificial process that mimics natural ripening. Once fully oxidised or \"blackened\", they are brined and acid corrected and are then ready for eating.<ref name=\"Kailis, Stanley G. 2007\"/>\n\n===Olive wood===\nOlive wood is very hard and is prized for its durability, colour, high combustion temperature and interesting grain patterns.  Because of the commercial importance of the fruit, and the slow growth and relatively small size of the tree, olive wood and its products are relatively expensive.  Common uses of the wood include: kitchen utensils, carved wooden bowls, cutting boards, fine furniture, and decorative items.\n\nThe yellow or light greenish-brown wood is often finely veined with a darker tint; being very hard and close-grained, it is valued by woodworkers.<ref>{{cite book|title=EDIBLE TREES|date=1969|publisher=AnVi OpenSource Knowledge Trust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bgUqDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=12 June 2016|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\n\n[[File:Olive niche.jpg|thumb| Potential distribution of olive tree over the Mediterranean Basin.<ref name=\"Oteros (2014)\">Oteros, Jose (2014) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261005349_Modelizacin_del_ciclo_fenolgico_reproductor_del_olivo_%28Olea_europaea_L.%29?ev=prf_pub Modelizaci\u00f3n del ciclo fenol\u00f3gico reproductor del olivo].

Modern experience does not always confirm this, and, though showing a preference for the coast, they have long been grown further inland in some areas with suitable climates, particularly in the southwestern Mediterranean ([[Iberian peninsula|Iberia]], northwest [[Africa]]) where winters are mild.\n\n[[File:Olivares de la campi\u00f1a estepe\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|Olive plantation in Andaluc\u00eda, Spain]]\n\nOlives are now cultivated in many regions of the world with [[Mediterranean climate]]s, such as [[South Africa]], [[Chile]], [[Peru]], [[Australia]], and [[California]] and in areas with temperate climates such as [[New Zealand]], under irrigation in the [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] region in Argentina which has a desert climate.

They grow in any light soil, even on clay if well drained, but in rich soils they are predisposed to disease and produce poorer oil than in poorer soil. (This was noted by [[Pliny the Elder]].) Olives like hot weather and sunny positions without any shade while temperatures below {{convert|-10|C|F}} may injure even a mature tree. They tolerate [[drought]] well, thanks to their sturdy and extensive [[root]] system. Olive trees can live for several centuries and can remain productive for as long if they are pruned correctly and regularly.\n\nThere are only a handful of olive varieties that can be used to cross-pollinate. Pendolino olive trees are partially self-fertile, but pollenizers are needed for a large fruit crop. Other compatible olive tree pollenizers include Leccino and Maurino. Pendolino olive trees are used extensively as pollenizers in large olive tree groves.\n\n[[File:Olive Phenology.png|thumb| Phenological development of Olive flowering, following BBCH standard scale. a-50, b-51, c-54, d-57, (<15% open flowers); f-65, (>15% open flowers); g-67, (<15% open flowers); h-68.<ref name=\"Oteros et al., 2013\">{{cite journal|author=Oteros, J., Garc\u00eda-Mozo, H., V\u00e1zquez, L., Mestre, A., Dom\u00ednguez-Vilches, E., Gal\u00e1n, C. |year=2013|title= Modelling olive phenological response to weather and topography|journal= Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment|volume= 179|pages= 62\u201368|url=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/256103928_Modelling_olive_phenological_response_to_weather_and_topography |doi=10.1016/j.agee.2013.07.008}}</ref>]]\n\nOlives are propagated by various methods. The preferred ways are cuttings and layers; the tree roots easily in favourable soil and throws up [[Basal shoot|sucker]]s from the stump when cut down. However, yields from trees grown from suckers or seeds are poor; they must be [[budding|budded]] or [[grafting|grafted]] onto other specimens to do well (Lewington and Parker, 114). Branches of various thickness cut into lengths of about {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} planted deeply in [[manure]]d ground soon vegetate. Shorter pieces are sometimes laid horizontally in shallow trenches and, when covered with a few centimetres of soil, rapidly throw up sucker-like shoots. In Greece, grafting the cultivated tree on the wild tree is a common practice. In Italy, embryonic buds, which form small swellings on the stems, are carefully excised and planted under the soil surface, where they soon form a vigorous shoot.\n\nThe olive is also sometimes grown from seed. To facilitate [[germination]], the oily pericarp is first softened by slight rotting, or soaked in hot water or in an [[alkaline]] solution.\n\nIn situations where extreme cold has damaged or killed the olive tree the rootstock can survive and produce new shoots which in turn become new trees. In this way olive trees can regenerate themselves. In Tuscany in 1985 a very severe frost destroyed many productive, and aged, olive trees and ruined many farmers' livelihoods. However new shoots appeared in the spring and, once the dead wood was removed, became the basis for new fruit-producing trees. In this way an olive tree can live for centuries or even millennia.\n\nOlives grow very slowly, and over many years the trunk can attain a considerable diameter. [[A. P. de Candolle]] recorded one exceeding {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}} in girth. The trees rarely exceed {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height, and are generally confined to much more limited dimensions by frequent pruning.\n\nThe olive tree, ''Olea europaea'', is very hardy: drought-, disease- and fire-resistant, it can live to a great age. Its root system is robust and capable of regenerating the tree even if the above-ground structure is destroyed. The older the olive tree, the broader and more gnarled the trunk becomes. Many olive trees in the groves around the Mediterranean are said to be hundreds of years old, while an age of 2,000 years is claimed for a number of individual trees; in some cases, this has been scientifically verified.<ref name=ecosfera /> See [[Olive#Ancient olive trees|paragraph]] dealing with the topic.\n\nThe crop from old trees is sometimes enormous, but they seldom bear well two years in succession, and in many cases a large harvest occurs every sixth or seventh season.\n\nWhere the olive is carefully cultivated, as in [[Languedoc]] and [[Provence]], the trees are regularly pruned. The pruning preserves the flower-bearing shoots of the preceding year, while keeping the tree low enough to allow the easy gathering of the fruit.\n\nThe spaces between the trees are regularly fertilized.\n\n===Pests, diseases, and weather<!--linked from 'Forest pathology'-->===\nThere are various [[Forest pathology|pathologies]] that can affect olives. The most serious pest is the [[olive fruit fly]] (''Dacus oleae'' or ''Bactrocera oleae'') which lays its eggs in the olive most commonly just before it becomes ripe in the autumn. The region surrounding  the puncture rots, becomes brown and takes a bitter taste making the olive unfit for eating or for oil. For controlling the pest the practice has been to spray with insecticides ([[organophosphate]]s, e.g. [[dimethoate]]).  Classic organic methods have now been applied such as trapping, applying the bacterium [[Bacillus thuringiensis]] and spraying with [[kaolin]].  Such methods are obligatory for organic olives.\n\nA [[fungus]], ''Cycloconium oleaginum'', can infect the trees for several successive seasons, causing great damage to plantations. A species of [[bacterium]], ''[[Pseudomonas savastanoi]]'' pv. ''oleae'',<ref name=j1/> induces tumour growth in the shoots. Certain [[lepidopterous]] [[caterpillar]]s feed on the leaves and flowers.\n\nA pest which spreads through olive trees is the black scale bug, a small black [[scale insect]] that resembles a small black spot. They attach themselves firmly to olive trees and reduce the quality of the fruit; their main predators are [[wasps]]. The [[Plum curculio|curculio beetle]] eats the edges of leaves, leaving sawtooth damage.<ref name=burr>Burr, M. (1999). ''Australian Olives. A guide for growers and producers of virgin oils'', 4th edition. ISBN 0-9577583-0-8.</ref>\n\n[[Rabbit]]s eat the bark of olive trees and can do considerable damage, especially to young trees. If the bark is removed around the entire circumference of a tree it is likely to die. Voles and mice also do damage by eating the roots of olives.\n\nAt the northern edge of their cultivation zone, for instance in Southern France and north-central Italy, olive trees suffer occasionally from [[frost]]. [[Gale]]s and long-continued rains during the gathering season also cause damage.\n\n===As an invasive species===\n[[File:Invasive weeds in the adelaide hills.jpg|right|thumb|Olives as invasive weeds, [[Adelaide Hills]], [[Australia]]]]\n\nSince its first domestication, ''Olea europaea'' has been spreading back to the wild from planted groves. Its original wild populations in southern Europe have been largely swamped by feral plants.<ref name=j6/>\n\nIn some other parts of the world where it has been introduced, most notably [[South Australia]], the olive has become a major woody [[weed]] that displaces native vegetation. In South Australia, its seeds are spread by the introduced [[red fox]] and by many bird species, including the [[European starling]] and the native [[emu]], into woodlands, where they germinate and eventually form a dense canopy that prevents regeneration of native trees.<ref name=j7/> As the climate of South Australia is very dry and bushfire prone, the oil rich feral olive tree substantially increases the fire hazard of native [[sclerophyll]] woodlands.<ref>[http://www.pir.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/37900/Olives_weed.pdf Olives as Weeds] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205144030/http://www.pir.sa.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/37900/Olives_weed.pdf |date=February 5, 2013 }} Animal and Plant Control Commission of South Australia </ref>\n\n===Harvest and processing===\n\n[[File:Crop-forecast.png|thumb| Forecasting olive crop production based on aerobiological method.<ref name=\"(Oteros et al., 2014)\">Oteros, J., Orlandi, F., Garc\u00eda-Mozo, H., Aguilera, F., Dhiab, A.

More specifically in the Northern hemisphere, green olives are picked from the end of September to about the middle of November. Blond olives are picked from the middle of October to the end of November, and black olives are collected from the middle of November to the end of January or early February. In southern Europe, harvesting is done for several weeks in winter, but the time varies in each country, and with the season and the cultivar.\n\nMost olives today are harvested by shaking the boughs or the whole tree. Using olives found lying on the ground can result in poor quality oil, due to damage. Another method involves standing on a ladder and \"milking\" the olives into a sack tied around the harvester's waist. This method produces high quality oil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olivemuseum.com/harvest-olives.html|title=Methods for harvesting olive fruit|publisher=olivemuseum.com|accessdate=2 April 2014}}</ref>  A third method uses a device called an oli-net that wraps around the tree trunk and opens to form an [[umbrella]]-like catcher from which workers collect the fruit. Another method uses an electric tool, 'the oliviera', that has large [[tongs]] that spin around quickly, removing fruit from the tree. Olives harvested by this method are used for oil.\n\nTable olive varieties are more difficult to harvest, as workers must take care not to damage the fruit; baskets that hang around the worker's neck are used. In some places in Italy, Croatia, and Greece, olives are harvested by hand because the terrain is too mountainous for machines. As a result, the fruit is not bruised, which leads to a superior finished product. The method also involves sawing off branches, which is healthy for future production.<ref name=\"epikouria2006\">\"Unusual Olives\", ''Epikouria Magazine'', Spring/Summer 2006</ref>\n\nThe amount of oil contained in the fruit differs greatly by cultivar; the [[pericarp]] is usually 60\u201370% oil. Typical yields are {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of oil per tree per year.<ref name=r1/>\n\n==Global production==\nOlives are one of the most extensively cultivated fruit crops in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps3.fao.org/wiews/olive/intro.jsp |title=FAO, 2004 |publisher=Apps3.fao.org |accessdate=2009-05-18}}</ref> In 2011 there were about 9.6 million hectares planted with olive trees, which is more than twice the amount of land devoted to apples, bananas or mangoes.

''radlkoferii'') are now widely accepted as regional variation with two forms; an arid form from drier areas and a more lush form from regions of higher rainfall.\n\nLobengula's Indaba tree is an old example of this tree, it is found at the state house in [[Bulawayo]] in [[Zimbabwe]].<ref name=\"Coates\"/>\n\n===Ecology===\nThe fruit is eaten by various frugivorous birds and animals which in turn distribute the seeds in their droppings. The leaves are browsed by game such as [[elephant]], [[giraffe]], [[kudu]], [[nyala]], [[bushbuck]], [[grey duiker]] and domestic stock animals.\n\nThe jacket plum is recorded as larval food of the following butterflies of southern Africa:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantnop/papcap.htm | title=''Pappea capensis'' | publisher=Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden | date=June 2004 | accessdate=September 21, 2011 | author=Hankey, Andrew}}</ref>\n*Common hairtail butterfly (''[[Anthene definita]]'')\n*Brown playboy butterfly (''[[Virachola antalus]]'')\n*Pearlspotted charaxes (''[[Charaxes jahlusa]]'')\n*Gold-banded forester (''[[Euphaedra neophron]]'')\n\nThe sweetly scented flowers attract a wide variety of insects and birds. The seed is parasitised by a small, bright red bug (''[[Leptocoris hexophtalma]]'') which sucks the oil from the seed on the ground below the tree.\n\n===Uses and cultural aspects===\nThe delicious and very juicy fruit with a tart flavour is used to make preserve, jelly, vinegar and an alcoholic drink.\n\nLeaves, bark and the oil extracted from the seed are used medicinally against baldness, ringworm, nosebleeds, chest complaints, eye infections, and venereal disease. Bark is also used in protective charms that are sprinkled on the ground. Some research has reported that the leaves are very effective in killing snails. Infusions of the bark are also used by Kenyan [[Maasai people|Maasai]] warriors to gain courage as well as an [[aphrodisiac]] and a blood-strengthening tonic. The root is used orally or as an enema and as a purgative for cattle.\n\nThe wood is hard, light brown with a reddish tint, tough and heavy with a twisted grain. There is little difference between the heartwood and the sapwood. The stems seldom attain significant girth and therefore do not yield much usable wood. This tree is used as an important source of [[herbal medicine]].\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Pappea capensis|''Pappea capensis''}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Monotypic Sapindaceae genera]]\n[[Category:Trees of Africa]]\n[[Category:Plants used in traditional African medicine]]",

It is native to [[Southern Africa]], including [[South Africa]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Mozambique]]. It is the only species in the genus '''''Ptaeroxylon'''''.\n\n== Background ==\n''Ptaeroxylon obliquum'' is a species from the Rutaceae family which are most abundant in South Africa and Australia.<ref name=\"CEE 2009\"/> The term ''ptaeroxylon'' is Greek for sneeze and wood,<ref name=\"Plantz Afrika\"/> while ''obliquum'' denotes the oblique shape of the leaflets. The wood produces oils containing [[nieshoutol]], which causes violent [[sneeze]] attacks by workers who are exposed to the tree.<ref name=\"Plantz Afrika\"/> Though sneezewood is not [[poisonous]], it has been known to cause respiratory complications. It has been linked to [[asthma]], [[rhinitis]] and mucosal inflammation.<ref name=\"Anderson 2000\"/>\n\n== Description ==\n[[image:Ptaeroxylon obliquum, stam en lower, Manie van der Schijff BT.jpg|thumb|left|200px|foliage]]\n[[image:Ptaeroxylon obliquum, blomme, Manie van der Schijff BT, c.jpg|thumb|left|200px|male flowers]]\n''Ptaeroxylon obliquum'' is a shrub or medium deciduous tree that stands up to {{convert|15|m|ft}} tall.<ref name=\"Roux 2003\"/>\nThe bark is whitish-grey and smooth when young, but fissured with age. Leaflets are 2.5 x 1.3&nbsp;cm marked asymmetrically. They are blue-green to dark green in color and crowd near the ends of the rachis in three to seven pairs of leaflets. The flowers on the tree are white to creamy yellow and fragrant.<ref name=\"Flora... 2009\"/>\n\nSneezewood is very dense having a [[specific gravity]] of 1040&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>\n\n== Uses ==\n\n===Lumber===\nSneezewood is an extremely hard and durable [[timber]] wood. It often lasts longer than [[brass]] or [[iron]] when used for machine [[bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s.<ref name=\"Roux 2003\"/>\n\nIn the past, sneezewood was used extensively for [[Railroad tie|railway sleepers]]. It can also be used to make [[furniture]]. In [[Mozambique]] it is used to make [[xylophone]] keys.<ref name=\"Plantz Afrika\"/>\n\nSneezewood is a very attractive wood with golden [[heartwood]] with light orange figures and is a favorite amongst [[woodturning|woodturners]].\n\nIts scarcity today is due in part of its past use as [[fuel]] for [[steamboat|steam]] [[tugboat|tug]]s.<ref name=\"Plantz Afrika\"/>\nIt has been used extensively for [[fence]] and [[telegraph pole]]s as well.<ref name=\"Roux 2003\"/>\n\n===Medicinal===\nSneezewood is used for medicinal and ritual purposes. The bark can be used to repel moths or as snuff. The resin has been used to get rid of warts and cattle ticks.<ref name=\"Plantz Afrika\"/>\n\nThe [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] have traditionally made [[snuff (tobacco)|snuff]] from sneeze-wood to relieve [[headaches]].<ref name=\"Schirmer 1980\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Southern African Sand Forest]]\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Ptaeroxylon obliquum|''Ptaeroxylon obliquum''}}\n<references>\n\n<ref name=\"CEE 2009\">\n  \"Rue.\" ''Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition'' (2009): 1.

It has several common names, including '''barwood''',<ref>{{PLANTS|id=PTER|taxon=Pterocarpus erinaceus|accessdate=15 October 2015}}</ref> '''muninga''', '''''v\u00e8ne''''', and '''''mukwa'''''; is used for this species as well as other ''[[Pterocarpus]]''. Groves of the tree can be found on the savannahs of West Africa, but it is becoming increasingly rare and is sometimes cultivated. The tree also grows in forests of [[Como\u00e9 National Park]] in [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]], a region geographically close to the Sahel but with a higher moisture regime due to its location between two large rivers. The tree grows to about 11 meters in height on average, and bears dark, scaly bark and yellow flowers. The fruits are winged pods. ''P. erinaceus'' grows well on sunny, hot African plains with long dry seasons and frequent fires.\n\nThe wood, which varies from yellowish to rosy reds and rich browns, is valued for woodworking, and makes good [[charcoal]] and fuel wood. The tree exudes a red sap called ''[[kino (gum)|kino]]'', which is used as a dye in [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] and cloth-making. As a legume, the tree harbors [[rhizobia]] that return nitrogen to the soil, making it more fertile. Such plants are desirable on farmland. In addition, the foliage is a nutritious [[fodder]] for farm animals. [[Mali]] has an active market for ''P. erinaceus'' foliage, which is in high demand by sheep farmers for fodder. The tree has several [[Herbalism|medicinal uses]], including reduction of fever and cough suppression.<ref>[http://www.winrock.org/fnrm/factnet/factpub/FACTSH/P_erinaceus.html ''Pterocarpus erinaceus'': An important legume tree in African savannas]</ref>\n\n''Pterocarpus erinaceus'' is one of the traditional [[Djembe#Shell|djembe]] woods.\n\n''Pterocarpus erinaceus'' was brought to Europe in the 19th century by the Scottish explorer [[Mungo Park (explorer)|Mungo Park]]. Currently, it is a threatened due to [[overexploitation]], [[environmental degradation]], and [[climatic change]]s. However, the tree is somewhat prolific and easy to cultivate, so reforestation efforts have shown some success.\n\nOther names for the tree include '''''bani''''' in [[Fula language|Fulfulde]], '''''tolo''''' in [[Zarma language|Djerma]], and '''''ban''''' in [[Serer language|Serer]].<ref>[http://www.fao.org/ag/aGp/agpc/doc/Gbase/DATA/PF000396.HTM FAO Species Profile]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{WestAfricanPlants|Pterocarpus erinaceus}}\n\n[[Category:Pterocarpus|erinaceus]]\n[[Category:Flora of South Africa]]\n[[Category:Trees of Africa]]\n[[Category:Flora of Ivory Coast]]",

The populations in Italy, southeast Europe, and Asia Minor and the Caucasus are sometimes treated as separate species, ''Q. brutia'' Tenore, ''Q. pedunculiflora'' K. Koch and ''Q. haas'' Kotschy respectively.\n\nA close relative is the [[sessile oak]] (''Q. petraea''), which shares much of its range. ''Q. robur'' is distinguished from this species by its leaves having only a very short stalk {{convert|3|-|8|mm|abbr=on}} long, and by its pedunculate (stalked) [[acorn]]s. The two often [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridise]] in the wild, the hybrid being known as ''Quercus'' \u00d7 ''rosacea''.\n\n''Q. robur'' should not be confused with ''Q. rubra'', the [[Quercus rubra|red oak]], which is a native of North America and only distantly related.\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Baginton oak tree july06.JPG|thumb|left|An old English oak in [[Baginton]], England]]\n[[File:Quercus robur - sprouting acorn.jpg|thumb|Seedling sprouting from its acorn]]\n[[File:Oaksprout.jpg|thumb|An oak sprout in a glass container]]\n\n''Quercus robur'' is a large [[deciduous]] tree, with circumference of grand oaks from {{convert|4|m|abbr=on}} to exceptional {{convert|12|m|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The Majesty Oak with a circumference of {{convert|12.2|m|abbr=on}} is the thickest tree in [[Great Britain]],{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} and the [[Kaive Oak]] in [[Latvia]] with a circumference of {{convert|10.2|m|abbr=on}} is the thickest tree in [[Northern Europe]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} ''Quercus robur'' has lobed and nearly sessile (very short-stalked) leaves {{convert|7|-|14|cm|abbr=on}} long.

Numerous insects live on the leaves, buds, and in the acorns. ''Q. robur'' supports the highest biodiversity of insect herbivores of any British plant (>400 spp).  The acorns form a valuable food resource for several small [[mammal]]s and some birds, notably [[Eurasian jay]]s ''Garrulus glandarius''. Jays were overwhelmingly the primary propagators<ref>{{cite book |page= 131 |title=Forest and Woodland Trees in Britain |first= John |last=White |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |ISBN= 0-19-854883-4}}</ref> of oaks before humans began planting them commercially, because of their habit of taking acorns from the umbra of its parent tree and burying them undamaged elsewhere. Mammals, notably [[squirrel]]s who tend to hoard acorns and other nuts most often leave them too abused to grow in the action of moving or storing them.\n\n==Commercial forestry==\n''Quercus robur'' is planted for [[forestry]], and produces a long-lasting and durable [[heartwood]], much in demand for interior and furniture work. The wood of ''Q. robur'' is identified by a close examination of a [[cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] perpendicular to fibres. The wood is characterised by its distinct (often wide) dark and light brown growth rings. The earlywood displays a vast number of large vessels (~{{convert|0.5|mm|abbr=on}} diameter). There are rays of thin (~{{convert|0.1|mm|abbr=on}}) yellow or light brown lines running across the growth rings. The timber is around {{convert|720|kg|abbr=on}} per cubic meter in density.<ref>[http://www.nichetimbers.co.uk/native-hardwood/british-oak/ British Oak]. Niche Timbers. Accessed 19-08-2009.</ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\nA number of [[cultivar]]s are grown in [[garden]]s and [[park]]s and in [[Arboretum|arboreta]] and botanical gardens.  The most common cultivar is ''Quercus robur'' 'Fastigiata', and is the exception among ''Q. robur'' cultivars which are generally smaller than the standard tree,  growing to between 10\u201315 m and exhibit unusual leaf or crown shape characteristics.\n\n;In Australia\nEnglish oak is one of the most common park trees in south-eastern Australia, noted for its vigorous, luxuriant growth. In [[Australia]], it grows very quickly{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} to a tree of {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}} tall by up to {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}} broad, with a low-branching canopy. Its trunk and secondary branches are very thick and solid and covered with deep-fissured blackish-grey bark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotrees.com.au/treehandbook/page-listings/quercus-robur.html |title=Quercus robur |publisher=Metrotrees.com.au |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref>\nThe largest example in Australia is in [[Donnybrook, Western Australia|Donnybrook]], [[Western Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Nina Smith |url=http://www.donnybrookmail.com.au/news/local/news/general/australias-biggest-oak-tree/1701700.aspx |title=Australia's Biggest Oak Tree |publisher=Donnybrookmail.com.au |date=2009-12-10 |accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref> Native Australian oaks are quite unrelated to the European oaks.\n\n===Cultivars===\n*''Quercus robur'' 'Fastigiata' (\"Cypress Oak\"), probably the most common cultivated form, it grows to a large imposing tree with a narrow columnar habit. The fastigiate oak was originally propagated from an upright tree that was found in central Europe.\n*''Quercus robur'' 'Concordia' (\"Golden Oak\"), a small very slow-growing tree, eventually reaching {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}}, with bright golden-yellow leaves throughout spring and summer.

This is based on the '[[Gernikako Arbola|tree of Gernika]]', an ancient oak tree located in [[Gernika]], below which since at least the 13th century the [[Lords of Biscay]] first, and afterwards their successors the [[Kings of Castile]] and the [[Kings of Spain]] solemnly swore to uphold the [[Fuero|charter of Biscay]], which secured widespread rights to the inhabitants of [[Biscay]]. Since the 14th century, the [[Juntas Generales]] (the parliament of Biscay) gathers in a building next to the oak tree, and symbolically passes its laws under the tree as well. Nowadays, the [[Lehendakari]] (Basque prime minister) swears his oath of office under the tree.\n\n===Bulgaria===\nThe national [[coat of arms of Bulgaria]] includes two crossed oak branches with fruits - as shield ([[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]]) [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]].\n\n===Croatia===\nOak leaves with acorns are depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Croatian 5 [[Croatian kuna|lipa]] coin, minted since 1993.<ref>[http://www.hnb.hr Croatian National Bank] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506012028/http://www.hnb.hr |date=6 May 2009 }}.

It can be found in several paintings of Caspar David Friedrich and in \"Of the life of a Good-For-Nothing\" written by Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff as a symbol of the state protecting every man. In those works the oak is shown in different situations, with leaves and flowers or dead without any of its previous beauty. Those conditions are mostly symbols for the conditions Germany is in or going through. Furthermore, the oak's stem is a symbol for Germany's strength and stability. Oak branches were displayed on the reverse of the small coins of the old [[Deutsche Mark]] currency (1 through 10 Pfennigs; the 50 Pfennigs coin showed a woman planting an oak seedling), and are now also displayed on the reverse of the small German-issue [[Euro]] currency coins (1 through 5 cents).\n\n===Ireland===\nIn Ireland, at [[Birr Castle]], an example, over 400 years old has a girth of 6.5&nbsp;m.

In arid regions it prefers low-lying sites near streams, watercourses and in valleys, but in higher rainfall areas is a common constituent of the bush, often favouring forest margins. Once established, young trees are quite frost-hardy. \n\n==Description==\nIts normal habit is that of a multi-stemmed, untidy, large shrub with a tendency for the shoots to scramble using their recurved prickles, and often develops into a single-stemmed tree of 5-10m in height and 300mm trunk diameter. The rounded crown of dense, dark green foliage is composed of very small [[pinnule]]s. Translucent red pods provide a colourful display when backlit. The flaking bark is light grey, splitting longitudinally and transversely, and revealing a buff under-colour. The persistent prickles are profuse on young twigs, but can also be found on older wood. Unlike members of the genus ''[[Acacia]]'', the prickles are not in pairs, but scattered along young twigs ('ataxacantha' = orderless prickles).\n\nFlowers occur as clusters of off-white or cream-coloured terminal spikes which are fragrant and bloom during spring and summer. <ref>''A Field Guide to the Acacias of Southern Africa'' - Lynette Davidson, [[Barbara Jeppe]]</ref> The timber, resembling that of ''[[Acacia melanoxylon]]'', often has [[heart rot]], but is of good quality and handsomely streaked in black, dark brown, purple and cream, with markedly contrasting off-white sapwood.\n\nThe appearance of this species may be confused with ''[[Senegalia caffra]]'' which differs by having paired prickles, stouter pods and greyish-green markedly pendent foliage.\n\n==Related articles==\n*[[List of Southern African indigenous trees and woody lianes]]\n\n==Gallery==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = center\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    = \n| header_align = center\n| image1    = Acacia ataxacantha01.jpg\n| alt1      = \n| width1    = 231\n| caption1  = <center>Flower and leaf buds</center>\n| image2    = Acacia ataxacantha, loof en peule, b, Louwsburg.jpg\n| alt2      = \n| width2    = 204\n| caption2  = <center>Foliage and pods</center>\n| image3    = Acacia ataxacantha, bas, Little Eden.jpg\n| alt3      = \n| width3    = 204\n| caption3  = <center>Bark texture</center>\n| image4    = Acacia ataxacantha00.jpg\n| alt4      = \n| width4    = 129\n| caption4  = <center>Heartwood/sapwood</center>\n| background color=;border:none;\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Senegalia ataxacantha|''Senegalia ataxacantha''}}\n{{WestAfricanPlants|Acacia ataxacantha}}\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Senegalia|ataxacantha]]\n[[Category:Trees of Africa]]",

It was formerly included in the genus ''Acacia''.\n\n==Description==\n''Senegalia laeta'' is a perennial shrub or small tree growing to a height of 4-10m with a greyish-green bark looking blackish from a distance, with a pink slash. The leaves are twice-pinnate, i.e. the pinnate leaves are further divided pinnately, the leaflets are 1\u20134&nbsp;cm long, with 2-5 pairs of [[pinnation|pinnae]] and 2-5 pairs of leaflets per pinna ; leaflets are oblong and asymmetrical, measuring 6-1.2 x 0.3-0.5&nbsp;cm, greyish green and almost hairless. These leaves distinguish ''Senegalia laeta'' from the related [[sympatry|sympatric]] species such as ''[[Senegalia dudgeoni]]'', ''[[Senegalia senegal]]'', ''[[Senegalia gourmaensis]]'' and ''[[Senegalia mellifera]]'' by its leaves. The thorns are paired and consist of recurved axillary prickles, with an occasional a third prickle recurved forward, if the third thorn is absent it is normally replaced with a leaf. The flowers are creamy white and very fragrant, with three flowers set on a stalk with multiple stalks growing on a spike. The pale brown leathery pods are pointed, whereas those of ''Seneglia senegal'' are not and this character is an easy feature to distinguish these ''Senegalia laeta'' from that species.<ref name = FAO>{{cite web | url = http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/agpc/doc/gbase/Data/pf000357.HTM | title = Acacia laeta | accessdate = 25 November 2016 | publisher = [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]}}</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\n''Senegalia laeta'' is native to [[Africa]], including the [[Sahara]] as far south as [[Tanzania]],  the [[Middle East]], and [[Western Asia]].<ref name = FAO/><ref name=fii>{{ cite web |url=http://www.flowersinisrael.com/AcaciaLaeta_page.htm |title=''Senegalia laeta'' (as ''Acacia laeta'')|accessdate=2016-11-25| publisher = Martha Modzelevich|work = Flowers in Israel}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\nParts of the tree are used for [[dyestuff]]; The tree is used for [[fodder]]; the foliage and seed pods make good [[forage]] for [[livestock]] and the tree stands up well to this use.<ref name=UTP/>\n\nIt produces an edible gum which is used to make [[gum arabic]] but is not as good quality as the gum Arabic extracted from ''Senegalia senegal''.

It is valued for its timber.\n\nThe ''Sideroxylon grandiflorum'' fruit is analogous to the [[peach]]. They are both termed [[drupes]] because both have a hard [[endocarp]], or pit, surrounding the seed, with the endocarp naturally splitting along a fracture line during germination.\n[[File:DodoTree-Naturalis-PeterMaas2009.jpg|248px|thumb|left|Preserved seeds.]]\nIn 1973, it was thought that this species was dying out. There were supposedly only 13 specimens left, all estimated to be about 300 years old. The true age could not be determined because tambalacoque has no [[growth ring]]s. [[Stanley Temple]] hypothesized that the [[dodo]], which became extinct in the 17th century, ate tambalacoque fruits, and only by passing through the digestive tract of the dodo could the seeds germinate. Temple (1977) force-fed seventeen tambalacoque fruits to [[wild turkey]]s. Seven of the fruits were crushed by the bird's gizzard. The remaining ten were either regurgitated or passed with the bird's feces. Temple planted the remaining ten fruits and three germinated. Temple did not try to germinate any seeds from control fruits not fed to turkeys so the effect of feeding fruits to turkeys was unclear. Reports made on tambalacoque seed germination by Hill (1941) and King (1946) found the seeds germinated without abrading.\n\nTemple's hypothesis that the tree required the dodo has been contested. Others have suggested the decline of the tree was exaggerated, or that other extinct animals may also have been distributing the seeds, such as [[tortoise]]s, [[fruit bat]]s or the [[broad-billed parrot]]. Wendy Strahm and Anthony Cheke, two experts in [[Mascarene Islands|Mascarene]] [[ecology]], claim that while a rare tree, it has germinated since the demise of the dodo and numbers a few hundred, not 13.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The difference in numbers is because young trees are not distinct in appearance and may easily be confused with similar species. The decline of the tree may possibly be due to [[introduced species|introduction]] of [[domestic pig]]s and [[crab-eating macaque]]s and competition with introduced plants. Catling (2001) in a summary cites Owadally and Temple (1979), and Witmer (1991). Hershey (2004) reviewed the flaws in Temple's dodo-tambalacoque hypothesis.\n\nIn 2004, [[Botanical Society of America|Botanical Society of America's]] Plant Science Bulletin<ref>{{cite journal|last=Herhey|first=David R.|title=The Widespread Misconception that the Tambalacoque or Calvaria Tree Absolutely Required the Dodo Bird for its Seeds to Germinate|journal=Plant Science Bulletin|year=2004|volume=50|issue=4|pages=105\u2013108}}</ref> disputed Dr. Temple's research as flawed which published evidence as to why the dodo's extinction did not directly cause the increasing disappearance of young trees including suggestion that [[tortoises]] would have been more likely to disperse the seeds than dodo hence discrediting Temple's view as to the dodo and the tree's sole survival relationship.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.botany.org/PlantScienceBulletin/psb-2004-50-4.php#Dodo |title=The Widespread Misconception that the Tambalacoque or ''Calvaria'' Tree Absolutely Required the Dodo Bird for its Seeds to Germinate |first=David R |last=Herhey |journal=Plant Science Bulletin |year=2004 |volume=50 |issue=4 |issn=0032-0919}}</ref>\n\nTo aid the seed in germination, botanists now use [[Turkey (bird)|turkeys]] and [[Tumble polishing|gem polishers]] to erode the endocarp to allow germination.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}<!--pooh-poohed by Hershey, D.

The species has a variety of [[common name]]s, including '''Athel tamarisk''',<ref>{{PLANTS|id=TAAP|taxon=Tamarix aphylla|accessdate=8 December 2015}}</ref> '''Athel tree''', '''Athel pine''', and '''saltcedar'''.  It is an evergreen tree, native across North, East and Central Africa, through the Middle East, and into parts of Western and Southern Asia.\n\n==Distribution==\n''Tamarix aphylla'' is found along watercourses in arid areas. It is very resistant to saline and alkaline soils. <ref>[http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/tamaph/all.html]</ref> The latitudinal range ranges from 35 N to 0 N, and it ranges from Morocco and Algeria in North Africa eastwards to Egypt and south to the Horn of Africa and into Kenya. It is found in the Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula, east through Iran and into India, Pakistan and Afghanistan.<ref name=CAB>CAB International, (2000) [http://www.cabi.org/compendia/fc/index.asp Forestry Compendium Global Module]. Wallingford, UK: CAB International</ref> \n\n==Description==\n''Tamarix aphylla'' grows as a tree to 18 metres (60&nbsp;ft) high. The tiny leaves are alternately arranged along the branches, and exude salt, which can form a crusted layer on the surface, and drip onto the ground beneath.<ref name=CAB/> The species can reproduce by seed or by suckering.\n\n==Uses==\n''Tamarix aphylla'' has been used as a windbreak and shade tree in agriculture and [[horticulture]] for decades, especially in dryer regions such as the western United States and central and western Australia. Due to its higher fire adaptability it can be used as a barrier to fire. Even the dry wood of Tamarix due to its high ash (30\u201340%) and higher salt content of its foliage makes it difficult to burn. After a fire it usually regrows unless the root crown is also destroyed.<ref>[http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/tamaph/all.html]</ref>\nThe nectar from the blossoms of tamarix aphylla produces a high quality honey with a unique taste. \n\n;Australia\nWithin these regions it has spread, most dramatically and noticeably in central Australia after floods of 1974 along the [[Finke River]] in the Northern Territory. Since then it has become a serious weed and [[invasive species]] in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. The species had been present for many decades without much spread before this.<ref name=renamed_from_74_on_20090930081730>Griffin, G. F.; Smith, D. M. S.; Morton, S. R.; Allan, G. E.; Masters, K.

''Terminalia catappa'' has corky, light fruit that are dispersed by water. The seed within the fruit is edible when fully ripe, tasting almost like almond. As the tree gets older, its crown becomes more flattened to form a spreading, vase shape. Its branches are distinctively arranged in tiers. The [[leaf|leaves]] are large, {{convert|15|-|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|10|-|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} broad, ovoid, glossy dark green, and leathery. They are dry-season [[deciduous]]; before falling, they turn pinkish-reddish or yellow-brown, due to [[pigment]]s such as [[violaxanthin]], [[lutein]], and [[zeaxanthin]]. \n[[Image:Desi Badam (Terminalia catappa) tree in Kolkata W IMG 2207.jpg|thumb|right|''T. catappa'' tree in  [[Kolkata]], [[West Bengal]], [[India]]]]\n\nThe [[trees]] are [[plant sexuality|monoecious]], with distinct male and female flowers on the same tree. Both are {{convert|1|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, white to greenish, inconspicuous with no petals; they are produced on axillary or terminal spikes. The [[fruit]] is a [[drupe]] {{convert|5|-|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|-|5.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} broad, green at first, then yellow and finally red when ripe, containing a single [[seed]].\n\n==Habitat and range==\nThe tree has been spread widely by humans, so the native range is uncertain. It has long been naturalised in a broad belt extending from Africa to northern [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]] through [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Micronesia]] into the [[Indian Subcontinent]]. More recently, the plant has been introduced to parts of the [[Americas]]. Until the mid 20th century, the tree has been extensively used in Brazilian urban landscaping, since being a rare case tropical deciduous, their fallen leaves would give a \"European\" flair to the street. This practice is currently abolished, and the \"amendoeiras\" are being replaced by native, evergreen trees.\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[Image:Terminalia catappa fruits at various stages of ripeness-1.JPG|thumb|right|''T. catappa'' fruits at various stages of ripeness, one cut open to reveal the edible kernel within the hard [[endocarp]] and another partially opened to reveal the fleshy [[mesocarp]] surrounding the fibrous inner layers]]\n[[Image:Terminalia catappa kernel and nut.jpg|thumb|right|Stripped nuts and a kernel (Desi badam) that is edible]]\n''T. catappa'' is widely grown in [[Tropics|tropical]] regions of the world as an [[ornamental tree]], grown for the deep shade its large leaves provide. The fruit is edible, tasting slightly acidic.\n\nThe [[wood]] is red and solid, and has high water resistance; it has been used in [[Polynesia]] for making [[canoe]]s. In [[Tamil language|Tamil]], almond is known ''nattuvadumai''.\n\nThe leaves contain several [[flavonoid]]s (such as [[kaempferol]] or [[quercetin]]), several [[tannin]]s (such as [[punicalin]], [[punicalagin]] or [[tercatin]]), [[saponine]]s and [[phytosterol]]s. Due to this chemical richness, the leaves (and the bark) are used in different [[herbal medicine]]s for various purposes. For instance in [[Taiwan]], fallen leaves are used as an herb to treat [[liver]] diseases. In [[Suriname]], an [[herbal tea]] made from the leaves is prescribed against [[dysentery]] and [[diarrhea]]. The leaves may contain agents for prevention of [[cancer]]s (although they have no demonstrated anticarcinogenic properties) and [[antioxidant]]s, as well as anti[[clastogenic]] characteristics. Extracts of ''T. catappa'' have shown activity against ''[[Plasmodium falciparum]]'' chloroquine (CQ)-resistant (FcB1) and CQ-sensitive (HB3) strains.<ref>Hnawia E, Hassani L, Deharo E, Maurel S, Waikedre J, Cabalion P, Bourdy G, Valentin A, Jullian V, Fogliani B.,\"Antiplasmodial activity of New Caledonia and Vanuatu traditional medicines\".

The [[leaf|leaves]] are 10&nbsp;cm long and 5&nbsp;cm broad, and are [[deciduous]] in the [[dry season]] (November to February). The [[flower]]s are produced at the end of the dry season just before the new leaves; they are small and whitish, growing in loose spikes 10\u201312&nbsp;cm long. The [[fruit]] is a [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] with two wings.\n\n==Uses==\nThe [[wood]] is either a light ('white limba') or with dark stripes ('black limba' or 'korina') [[hardwood]].  Used for making [[furniture]], [[table tennis blades]] (as outer ply), and [[musical instrument]]s and prized for its workability and excellent colour and finish. The most well known example of its use in guitars is when [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] produced their now highly sought-after [[Flying V]] and [[Gibson Explorer|Explorer]] guitars in 1958. Makers of table tennis blades choose limba, and in particular black limba for its flexibility and the idea that it enhances top spin play. Limba is used in some blades made by [[Stiga]] and OSP. When finished in a clear coat, 'white limba' results in an attractive light golden colour.\n\nContrary to popular belief, it is not rare and expensive due to [[overharvesting]] and there is plenty of supply due to efforts in the 1950s to preserve natural supply of the wood. This species is reportedly relatively secure, with little or no threat to its population within its natural growth range, according to the [[World Conservation Monitoring Center]] in 1992.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Terminalia superba-Mus\u00e9e royal de l'Afrique centrale (1).jpg\nFile:Terminalia superba-Mus\u00e9e royal de l'Afrique centrale (2).jpg\nFile:Terminalia superba-Mus\u00e9e royal de l'Afrique centrale (3).jpg\nFile:Terminalia superba-Mus\u00e9e royal de l'Afrique centrale (4).jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Gledhill, D.

''Vachellia karroo'' has a rounded crown, branching fairly low down on the trunk. It is variable in shape and size, reaching a maximum of about 12m where there is good water. The bark is red on young branches, darkening and becoming rough with age. Sometimes an attractive reddish colour can be seen in the deep bark fissures The leaves are finely textured and dark green. The abundant yellow flowers appear in early summer, or after good rains. The seed pods are narrow, flat and crescent shaped. They are green when young becoming brown and dry. The pods split open allowing the seeds to fall to the ground. The thorns are paired, greyish to white and are long and straight\n\n==Distribution==\nIt is a tree of open woodland and wooded grassland. It grows to its greatest size when rainfall of 800-900mm is received but can grow and even thrive in very dry conditions such as the Karoo region of western South Africa. The requirement here is for deep soils that allow its roots to spread. Everywhere in its range, however, the tree is easily recognised by its distinctive long white paired thorns and coffee coloured bark, both of which are very attractive. In the tropics it shows little variation but at the southern end of its range it becomes more variable in appearance.\n\n==Adaptations==\n''Vachellia karroo'' has a life span of 30\u201340 years and is an adaptable pioneer, able to establishing itself without shade, shelter or protection from grass fires. Once over a year old, seedlings can resprout after fire. Several fungi are associated with this tree and the crown of mature trees may be parasitized by various mistletoes, leading to the tree's decline. This tree has a long taproot which enables it to use water and nutrients from deep underground, this and its ability to fix nitrogen, lead to grasses and other plants thriving in its shade.\n\nThe tree has been noted to occur in the Torre del Mar area, near Malaga, Spain. Here it grows freely as a large shrub on waste ground. It has been used as hedging to keep out goats from vegetable plots. Flowers during July.\n\n== Uses ==\n[[Image:Acacia-karoo-range-map.png|left|thumb|{{leftlegend|#006600|native range|outline=gray}}\n{{leftlegend|#808000|introduced to region|outline=gray}}]]\n[[File:Acacia karroo00.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Winter habit of tree]]\n''V. karroo'' is used for chemical products, [[Fodder|forage]], domestic uses, environmental management, fibre, food, drink, and wood. The tough wood is white to slightly yellowish in colour, rarely producing dark brown heartwood. It is widely cultivated in Asia, Australia, the [[Mediterranean region]], [[India]] and the Indian Ocean area.<ref name=\"ildis\"/> The large thorns mean that the tree must be approached, and the branches handled, carefully.\n\n===Food===\nAs is common in acacias, edible gum seeps from cracks in the tree's bark, and is an important part of the [[Galago moholi|bushbaby's]] winter diet. The gum can be used to manufacture candy (see [[Gum arabic]]) and used to have economic importance as \"Cape Gum\". In dry areas, the tree's presence is a sign of water, both above and underground.\n<ref>[http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantab/acaciakar.htm ''Vachellia karroo'' PlanzAfrica]</ref>\n\n=== Forage and fodder ===\nThe tree is especially useful as forage and [[fodder]] for domestic and wild animals.  Apparently, there is no risk of [[poison]]ing from it. [[Goats]] seem to like ''V. karroo'' better than cattle.<ref name=\"world\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928031715/http://www.worldagroforestry.org/Sites/TreeDBS/aft/speciesPrinterFriendly.asp?Id=58 World AgroForestry Centre]</ref> The small pom-pom shaped yellow flowers are attractive in mid-summer. The flowers make it a very good source of forage for [[honey bee]]s; [[honey]] from it has a pleasant taste.\n\n===Wood and bark===\n''V. karroo'' is an excellent source of [[firewood]] and [[charcoal]].<ref name=\"world\"/> The wood is also used for fencing posts for cattle byres or kraals. The [[heartwood]] has a density of about 800&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3. A tough [[rope]] can be made from the inside bark of the tree.<ref name=\"fao\">[http://www.fao.org/docrep/V5360E/v5360e0f.htm FAO]</ref>\n\n===Traditional medicine===\n\nThe gum, bark and leaves have been used as a soothing agent and astringent for colds, conjunctivitis and hemorrhage in other region South Africa.However thorns were even used by early naturalists to pin the insects they collected! It is very widespread throughout southern Africa and there are different forms in some places, which can be confusing. ''Vachellia karroo'' may be found from the Western Cape through to Zambia and Angola. In tropical Africa it is replaced by ''[[Vachellia seyal]]''. The name acacia is derived from Greek \"akis\" a point or barb. Karroo is one of the old spellings of karoo which cannot be corrected because of the laws governing botanical nomenclature (giving of names). <ref>Joffe, Pitta: Indigenous Plants of South Africa, 2007, Briza Publications, p87</ref>\n\n== Bans ==\nNotifiable in NSW, Australia.

Its bark is reddish-brown or greyish-black, and is quite rough and fissured. The younger growing branches can have a purple-red appearance, hence its common names. An interesting characteristic about this plant is that it has both, long, straight thorns and shorter curved/hook-like thorns, but generally not both in one pair. Leaves are bipinnately compound (as is common in most African [[vachellia]] species) with 1 to 4 pinnae pairs, where each pinna again has 5 to 13 leaflet pairs. The flowers are white- to cream-coloured, and mostly seen during the summer months of December and January, but they can blossom almost all year round, depending on the geographical location. The fruit is a flat red-brown pod.\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n''Vachellia reficiens'' is found in the drier areas of Africa, in countries like [[Angola]], South Africa, [[Swaziland]] and [[Namibia]]. This plant seems to prefer rocky soil-types and it does not grow in high-rainfall areas, but rather in semi-desert and arid shrubland.\n\nIt is an abundant dominant species of arid shrubland throughout Kenya,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/004/AB396E/ab396e03.htm|title=State of Forest Genetic Resources in Kenya|last=Forest Resources Division|date=December 2001|work=Working papers FGR/18E|publisher=FAO|accessdate=11 February 2012|location=Rome, Italy}}</ref> and it forms up to 30% of total woody canopy in the South Turkana Ecosystem in the [[Turkana District]].<ref name=cough>{{cite journal|author1=Coughenour,  Michael B. |author2=Ellis, James E. |author3=Pop, Robert G. |year=1990|title= Morphometric Relationships and Developmental Patterns of ''Acacia tortilis'' and ''Acacia reficiens'' in Southern Turkana, Keny|journal=Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club|volume=117|issue=1|pages=8\u201317|jstor=2997124|doi=10.2307/2997124}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nThis tree's leaves are browsed upon by game and small livestock like the [[Greater Kudu]] and goats.<ref name=cough/><!-- refs goat bit --> In some areas of Namibia, ''Vachellia reficiens'' subsp.

The common name, ''fever tree'', comes from its tendency to grow in swampy areas: early European settlers in the region noted that [[malaria|malarial fever]] was contracted in areas with these trees. It is now understood that malarial fever is spread by [[mosquito]]s living in the swampy areas that often support this tree species, and not  by the tree species itself.<ref>[http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantab/acaciaxanth.htm ''Vachellia xanthophloea'' (as ''Acacia xanthophloea'') entry at PlantZAfrica.com]</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThese trees are immortalized by [[Rudyard Kipling]] in one of his ''[[Just So Stories]]'', \"[[The Elephant's Child]]\", wherein he repeatedly refers to \"the great grey-green, greasy [[Limpopo River]], all set about with fever-trees.\"<ref>\"[http://www.boop.org/jan/justso/elephant.htm The Elephant's hild]</ref>\n\n==Shamanic usage==\nThis tree has been used for thousands of years by African tribes as a [[divination]] tool. Bark from this tree and four other herbs including ''[[Silene undulata|Silene capensis]]'' (African dream root) and ''[[Oneirogen|Synaptolepis kirkii]]'' are boiled into a brew. This is taken to induce lucid dreams, which they call \"white paths\". Before going to sleep a question is asked that will be answered in their dreams. Medicinally, the roots and a powder made from bark stripped from the trunk are used as an emetic and as a [[Preventive healthcare|prophylactic]] against malaria.<ref name = agroforestry/>\n\n==Ecology==\n''Vachellia xanthophloea'' is found growing near swamps, riverine forests or on lake shores, in semi-evergreen bush land and woodland where there is a high groundwater table. In seasonally flooded areas it often forms dense single species stands.<ref name = agroforestry/>\n\nThe leaves and pods are used to provide food for livestock while the young branches and foliage are eaten by [[African elephant]]s while [[giraffe]] and [[vervet monkey]]s eat the pods and leaves. The flowers are used for foraging by bees and provides favoured nesting sites for birds.

''Vachellia xanthophloea'' is often planted as a source of firewood, but its gummy sap leaves a thick, black, tarlike residue when burnt. The valuable timber of ''Vachellia xanthophloea'' is pale reddish brown with a hard, heavy texture, and, because it is liable to crack, it should be seasoned before use. The timber is used to make poles and posts.<ref name = agroforestry/>\n\n==Invasive species==\nIn [[Queensland]] ''Vachellia xanthophlea'' is a prohibited invasive plant under the Biosecurity Act 2014 under which it must not be given away, sold, or released into the environment without a permit. The act further requires that all sightings of ''Vachellia xanthophlea'' are to be reported to the appropriate authorities within 24 hours and that within Queensland everyone is obliged to take all reasonable and practical steps to minimise the risk of ''Vachellia xanthophlea'' spreading until they have received advice from an authorised officer.
