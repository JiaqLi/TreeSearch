The name \"[[pine barrens]]\" refers to the area's sandy, acidic, nutrient-poor soil. Although European settlers could not cultivate their familiar crops there, the unique ecology of the Pine Barrens supports a diverse spectrum of plant life, including [[orchids]] and [[carnivorous plant]]s. The area is also notable for its populations of rare pygmy [[Pitch Pine]]s and other plant species that depend on the frequent fires of the Pine Barrens to reproduce. The sand that composes much of the area's soil is referred to by the locals as [[sugar sand]].\n\nDespite its proximity to the [[Urban sprawl|sprawling]] metropolitan cities of [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York City]] right in the heart of the very densely populated [[Northeast megalopolis|Boston-Washington Corridor]] on the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]], and the fact that the heavily travelled [[Garden State Parkway]] and [[Atlantic City Expressway]] run through it, the New Jersey Pine Barrens is largely rural and undisturbed. The Pine Barrens territory helps recharge the 17 [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] gallon [[Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer]] containing some of the purest water in the United States.<ref>Pearce, Jeremy.

A decade later, it was designated by the [[United Nations]] as an [[International Biosphere Reserve]].

[[Bog iron]] was mined from bogs, streams, and waterways, and was worked in furnaces at [[Batsto Village|Batsto]], [[Lake Atsion]], [[Ferrago]], [[Hanover Furnace|Hanover]], and several other locations. Iron from these early furnaces was instrumental in supplying the American military with weapons and camp tools during the [[American Revolution]], the [[War of 1812]], and the [[Second Barbary War]]. For example, Commodore [[Stephen Decatur, Jr.]] sailed to Algiers armed with 24-pound cannons that had been cast at [[Hanover Furnace|Hanover]] in 1814.<ref>McPhee, John, ''The Pine Barrens,'' Noonday Press (1967) p. 27</ref>  The bog iron industry declined in the mid-19th century after the discovery that iron ore could be mined more cheaply in [[Pennsylvania]].\n\nOther industries such as paper mills, sawmills, and gristmills rose and fell throughout the years, catering chiefly to local markets. Smaller industries such as charcoal-making and glassmaking also were developed, meeting with varying degrees of success. Over time, however, the forest reclaimed almost all traces of the Pine Barrens' industrial past. [[Ghost town]]s\u2014remnants of villages built around these former industries\u2014can still be found at various locations. [[Batsto Village]] has been restored to its mid-19th century state as a state historic site.\n\nThe Pine Barrens were home to many rural, backwoods families.  For years, residents of the rural area were called \"[[Piney (Pine Barrens Resident)|Pineys]]\" by outsiders, as a derogatory term. Today many Pinelands residents are proud of both the name and the land on which they live.<ref>Birdsall, Bob. ''[[People of the Pines]]'' (2007), Plexus Publishing, Inc., Medford, NJ.</ref> In the early 20th century, a family identified in a [[case study]] by the pseudonym, the [[The Kallikak Family|Kallikaks]], were presented as an example of genetic inferiority by [[eugenics|eugenicists]]. Today, scholars understand that the facts in the Kallikaks study were misrepresented, including photographs altered to make the family members appear more backward.<ref>[http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/kallikak.shtml \"Human Intelligence: The Kallikak Family\"], University of Indiana</ref>\n\nOn July 12, 1928, the Mexican aviator and national hero [[Emilio Carranza]] crashed and was killed in the Pinelands while returning from a historic goodwill flight from [[Mexico City]] to the United States. Flying back from Long Island, he encountered a [[thunderstorm]] and crashed in [[Burlington County, New Jersey|Burlington County]].

Its iron and charcoal deposits did not compete with more readily accessible deposits elsewhere. In 1969, the Pine Barrens averaged a density of 15 people per square mile, compared with 1000 people per square mile in the lands bordering it. With rising environmental concerns at the time, people became alerted to the possible destruction of the Pine Barrens and its aquifer by [[urban sprawl]].\n\nState authorities in the region discussed plans to construct a jetport and associated city in the Pine Barrens to alleviate congestion at other major regional airports of the mid-Atlantic. The low cost of land and lower incidence of fog in the area made the plan appealing.<ref>[http://newspapers.umsystem.edu/default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?BaseHRef=CMN/1969/01/26&EntityId=Ar02600&Skin=Google&ViewMode=GIF \"Biography of a Place: Wilderness Thrives Surrounded by City\"], ''[[Columbia Missourian]],'' 26 January 1969.

For instance, it was profitable for charcoal burners to set fires deliberately, in order to make the trees useless for any purpose other than charcoal making, then purchase the trees for a discount.<ref name=\"PBEL\"/>\n\nForest fires play an important role in regulating the growth of plants in the Pine Barrens. Frequent light fires tend to reduce the amount of undergrowth and promote the growth of mature trees. Forest fires have contributed to the dominance of [[Pinus rigida|pitch pine]] in the Pine Barrens. They can resist and recover quickly from fire by resprouting directly through their bark (something very unusual for pines). Their [[Serotiny|serotinous]] pine cones open only after having been heated by a fire.<ref name=\"PBEL\"/><ref>Dudley, Elizabeth. [https://books.google.com/books?id=yvhU_UUqzdAC ''Forests: A Fact-Filled Coloring Book''], 1990, p. 58.</ref> The prevalence of forest fire allows the pitch pines to dominate over oaks, which by comparison are usually killed outright by a moderate or intense fire. High air temperatures and dry plant undergrowth contribute to the intensity of the fire. While severe fires are uncommon, severe fires at fairly frequent intervals can eliminate species that do not bear seed at an early age. Frequent killing fires keep an area covered with small sprouts.<ref name=\"BCLS\">Forman, Richard. [http://www.bcls.lib.nj.us/pinelands/fire.shtml \"Review: ''Fire Effects in New Jersey's Pine Barrens'' by Silas Little\"], Library of New Jersey</ref>\n\nEfforts to battle forest fire attract debate over how to best preserve the Pine Barrens. While fires constitute a danger to property and inhabitants, preservationists argue that eliminating forest fires would cause the Pine Barrens to become dominated by oak trees. A few areas which had previously consisted of scrub and pitch pine have become dominated by oak trees because of intervention after settlement to reduce the frequency of forest fires.<ref>Peterson, Iver.

The [[seed cones]] are erect, {{convert|40|to|80|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long, dark purple, ripening brown and disintegrating to release the winged [[seed]]s in September.\n\n<gallery>\nAbies balsamea bark.jpg|Bark\nAbies balsamea 2 (5097476331).jpg|Leaves (needles) on symmetrical branchlets\nMorning dew on Abies balsamea.jpg|Closeup of thickly leaved branchlets\nAbies balsamea pollen cones2.jpg|Pollen cones\nAbies balsamea cones Niapiskau 02.jpg|Seed cones with [[resin]] oozing out in the [[Mingan Archipelago]], [[Quebec]]\n\n</gallery>\n\n== Varieties ==\nThere are two varieties:\n*''Abies balsamea'' var. ''balsamea'' (balsam fir) \u2013 bracts subtending seed scales short, not visible on the closed cones. Most of the species' range.\n*''Abies balsamea'' var. ''phanerolepis'' (bracted balsam fir or Canaan fir) \u2013 bracts subtending seed scales longer, visible on the closed cone. The southeast of the species' range, from southernmost [[Quebec]] to [[West Virginia]]. The name ''Canaan fir'' derives from one of its native localities, the [[Canaan Valley, West Virginia|Canaan Valley]] in West Virginia. Some botanists regard this variety as a natural hybrid between balsam fir and [[Fraser fir]] (''Abies fraseri''), which occurs further south in the Appalachian mountains.\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Carter Dome seen from Mt Hight.JPG|thumb|Balsam fir [[krummholz]] on [[Mount Hight]], [[New Hampshire]]]]\nBalsam fir tends to grow in cool climates, ideally with a mean annual temperature of 40<sup>o</sup>F, with consistent moisture at its roots. They typically grow in the following four forest types:\n* [[Swamp]] - swamp forest types never completely dry out, so balsam firs have constant access to water. The ground is covered in [[sphagnum]] and other mosses. In swamps, balsam firs grow densely and slowly, and are slender.\n* Flat - sometimes referred to as \"dry swamps,\" these areas are better drained than swamps but still retain moisture well. [[Fern moss]] covers the ground and there is a possibility of ground rot. In flat areas balsam fir grows fast, tall, and large, mixed with [[Picea rubens|red spruce]].\n* Hardwood slope -  ground rot is common in this well drained area and [[Plant litter|leaf litter]] covers the forest floor. Balsam firs grow fast, tall and large along with big [[hardwood]] trees such as [[Betula alleghaniensis|yellow birch]], [[Acer saccharum|sugar maple]] and [[beech]].\n* Mountain top - On mountain tops, stands of balsam fir occasionally develop [[fir wave]]s. They often grow at an elevation of 2,500 to 3,000 feet in pure strands, or in association with [[black spruce]], [[white spruce]] and trembling [[aspen]]. The development is similar to that in swamps with slow growth resulting in slender, short trees. Some of the low branches touch the ground, and may grow roots to produce an independent tree. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zon|first=Raphael|date=March 25, 1914|title=Balsam Fir|url=https://archive.org/stream/balsamfir55zonr#page/n1/mode/2up|journal=Bulletin of the U.S. Department of Agriculture|volume=55|pages=2-7}}</ref>\nThis tree provides food for moose, [[American red squirrel]]s, [[crossbill]]s and [[chickadee]]s, as well as shelter for moose, [[snowshoe hare]]s, [[white-tailed deer]], [[ruffed grouse]] and other small mammals and songbirds. The needles are eaten by some [[lepidoptera]]n caterpillars, for example the [[Io moth]] (''Automeris io'').\n\n== Life Cycle ==\nThe male reproductive organs generally develop more rapidly and appear sooner than the female organs. The male organs contain microsporangia which divide to form sporogenous tissue, composed of cells which become archesporial cells. These develop into microspores, or pollen-mother cells, once they are rounded and filled with starch grains. When the microspores undergo meiosis in the spring, four haploid [[Microspore|microspores]] are produced which eventually become pollen grains. Once the male strobilus has matured the microsporangia are exposed at which point the pollen is released.\n\nThe female megasporangiate is larger than the male. It contains bracts and megasporophylls, each of which contains two ovules, arranged in a spiral. These then develop a nucellus in which a mother cell if formed. [[Meiosis]] occurs and a megaspore is produced as the first cell of the megagametophyte. As cell division takes place the nucleus of the megaspore thickens, and cell differentiation occurs to produce prothallial tissue containing an [[Egg cell|ovum]]. The remaining undifferentiated cells then form the endosperm.\n\nWhen the male structure releases its pollen grains, some fall onto the female [[strobilus]] and reach the ovule. At this point the [[pollen tube]] begins to generate, and eventually the sperm and egg meet at which point [[Fertilisation|fertilization]] occurs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Balsam Fir: A Monographic Review|last=Bakuzis|first=E.V.|last2=Hansen|first2=Henry L.|last3=Kaufert|first3=Frank H.|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=January 1965|isbn=9780816661282|location=Minneapolis|pages=2, 8-14}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:BalsamFirEssOil.png|thumb|Balsam fir (''Abies balsamea'') essential oil in clear glass vial]]\n\nBoth varieties of the species are very popular as [[Christmas trees]], particularly in the northeastern United States.

Many fir limbs are vertically bowed from alternating periods of downward deformation from snow loading and new growth reaching upward for sunlight. Layers of inverted freshly cut limbs from small trees created a pleasantly fragrant mattress lifting bedding off the wet ground; and the bowed green limbs were springs beneath the soft needles. Upper layers of limbs were placed with the cut ends of the limbs touching the earth to avoid uncomfortably sharp spots and sap.<ref>Thoreau, Henry David ''The Maine Woods'' Apollo edition (1966) Thomas Y.

In [[Canada]] it is commonly known as [[Manitoba]] maple and occasionally as elf maple. '''Box elder''', '''boxelder maple''', '''ash-leaved maple''', and '''maple ash''' are its most common names in the [[United States]]; in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] it is also known as '''ashleaf maple'''.<ref name=BSBI07>{{cite web|title=BSBI List 2007 |publisher=Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland |url=http://www.bsbi.org.uk/BSBIList2007.xls |format=xls |access-date=2014-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6VqJ46atN?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bsbi.org.uk%2FBSBIList2007.xls |archivedate=2015-01-25 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Common names ==\n\nIndicative of its familiarity to many people over a large geographic range, ''A. negundo'' has numerous common names.\n\nThe names \"box elder\" and \"boxelder maple\" are based upon the similarity of its whitish wood to that of [[Buxus|boxwood]] and the similarity of its [[pinnate]]ly compound leaves to those of some species of [[Sambucus|elder]].<ref>[http://www.depauw.edu/univ/naturepark/natural_history/trees/aceraceae/acer_negundo.htm DePauw University]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>   This is the only North American maple with compound leaves, though several Asian species also have them.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book | last=Keeler | first=H.

These names include (but are not limited to) ash-, cut-, or three-leaf (or -leaved) maple; ash maple; sugar ash; Negundo maple; and river maple.<ref>[http://www.windsorplywood.com/ Acer spp. Aceraceae] Note that some of the common names given in this reference are questionable.  \"stinking ash\" and \"black ash\" typically refer to ''[[Ptelea trifoliata]]'' and ''[[Fraxinus nigra]]'', respectively.  This reference is retained as an example of the confusion which arises when plants such as ''A. negundo'' are discussed by other than their [[scientific name]]s.</ref>  In [[Canada]] it is commonly known as Manitoba maple and occasionally as elf maple.<ref>[http://cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/index/commtreesprairies/manitobamaple Community trees of the Prairie provinces&nbsp;\u2013 Canadian Forest Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  In [[Russia]] it is called American maple ({{lang-rus|\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0301\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043b\u0451\u043d|amerikansky klyon}})<!-- [[Wikipedia:Romanization of Russian]] --> as well as ash-leaf maple ({{lang-rus|\u043a\u043b\u0451\u043d \u044f\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0301\u0441\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439|klyon yasenelistny}}), and in Italian ''acero americano''.<ref>[http://luirig.altervista.org/flora/taxa/index2.php?scientific-name=acer+negundo Altervista Italiana, Acero americano, ''Acer negundo'' L.]</ref>\n\nCommon names may also designate a particular [[subspecies]].  For example, a common name for ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''interius'' may be preceded by \"inland\" (as in \"inland boxelder maple\").  A common name for ''A. negundo'' subsp.

It often has several trunks and can form impenetrable thickets.<ref name=\"gelderen\">van Gelderen, C.J. & van Gelderen, D.M. (1999). ''Maples for Gardens: A Color Encyclopedia''.</ref>\n\nThe shoots are green, often with a whitish to pink or violet [[wax]]y coating when young.  Branches are smooth, somewhat brittle, and tend to retain a fresh green colour rather than forming a [[bark]] of dead, protective tissue.  The bark on its trunks is pale gray or light brown, deeply cleft into broad ridges, and scaly.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nUnlike most other maples (which usually have [[simple leaf|simple]], [[palmate]]ly [[lobed leaf|lobed]] [[leaf|leaves]]), ''Acer negundo'' has [[pinnate]]ly [[compound leaf|compound]] leaves that usually have three to seven leaflets.  Simple leaves are also occasionally present;  technically, these are single-leaflet compound leaves.  Although some other maples (such as ''[[Acer griseum]]'', ''[[Acer mandshuricum]]'' and the closely related [[Acer cissifolium|''A. cissifolium'']]) have [[leaf shape|trifoliate]] leaves, only ''A. negundo'' regularly displays more than three leaflets.\n\nThe leaflets are about {{convert|5|-|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}} long and {{convert|3|-|7|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} wide with slightly serrate margins.  Leaves have a [[translucence|translucent]] light green color and turn yellow in the [[Autumn|fall]].\n\nThe [[flower]]s are small and appear in early spring on drooping [[raceme]]s {{convert|10|-|20|cm|in|0|sp=us}} long.  The [[fruit]]s are paired [[Samara (fruit)|samaras]], each seed slender, {{convert|1|-|2|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} long, with a {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|frac=4|sp=us}} incurved wing; they drop in autumn or they may persist through winter.  Seeds are usually both prolific and [[fertility|fertile]].\n\nUnlike most other maples, ''A. negundo'' is fully [[dioecious]] and both a male and female tree are needed for either to reproduce.\n\n* Winter buds: Terminal buds acute, an eighth of an inch long.  Lateral buds obtuse.  The inner scales enlarge when spring growth begins and often become an inch long before they fall.\n* Flowers: April, before the leaves, yellow green; staminate flowers in clusters on slender hairy pedicels one and a half to two inches long.  Pistillate flowers in narrow drooping racemes.\n* Calyx: Yellow green; staminate flowers campanulate, five-lobed, hairy.  Pistillate flowers smaller, five-parted; disk rudimentary.\n* Corolla: Wanting.\n* Stamens: Four to six, exserted; filaments slender, hairy; anthers linear, connective pointed.\n* Pistil: Ovary hairy, borne on disk, partly enclosed by calyx, two-celled, wing-margined.  Styles separate at base into two stigmatic lobes.\n* Fruit: Maple keys, full size in early summer.  Borne in drooping racemes, pedicels one to two inches long.  Key an inch and a half to two inches long, nutlets diverging, wings straight or incurved.  September.  Seed half an inch long.  Cotyledons, thin, narrow.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n\n=== Subspecies ===\n[[File:Acer negundo.jpg|thumb|right|''A. negundo'' leaves and fruits]]\n\n''Acer negundo'' is often discussed as comprising three subspecies, each of which was originally described as a separate species.  These are:\n\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''negundo'' is the main variety and the type to which characteristics described in the article most universally apply.  Its natural range is from the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] to the Rocky Mountains.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''interius'' has more leaf serration than the main species and a more [[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]] leaf surface.  As the name ''interus'' indicates, its natural range of [[Saskatchewan]] to [[New Mexico]] is sandwiched between that of the other two subspecies.<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''californicum'' has larger leaves than the main species.  Leaves also have a velvety texture which is essential to distinguish it from ''A. negundo'' subsp. ''negundo''.  It is found in parts of [[California]] and [[Arizona]].<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n\nSome authors further subdivide subsp. ''negundo'' into a number of regional varieties but these intergrade and their maintenance as distinct [[taxa]] is disputed by many.  Even the differences between recognized subspecies are probably a matter of gradient [[speciation]]\n\nFinally, note that a few botanists treat boxelder maple as its own distinct genus (''Negundo aceroides'') but this is not widely accepted.\n\n== Distribution ==\nAs noted, varieties thrive across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. It may also be found as far south as [[Guatemala]].\n\nAlthough native to [[North America]], it is considered an [[invasive species]] in some areas of that continent. It can quickly [[colonize]] both cultivated and uncultivated areas and the range is therefore expanding both in North America and elsewhere. In Europe where it was introduced in 1688 as a park tree it is able to spread quickly in places and is considered an invasive species in parts of Central Europe (Germany and the Czech Republic, middle Danube, Vistula river valley in Poland) where it can form mass growth in lowlands, disturbed areas and riparian biomes on calcareous soils. It has also become [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] in eastern [[China]]<ref name=\"gelderen\" />  and can be found in some of the cooler areas of the [[Australian continent]] where it is listed as a pest [[invasive species]].\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Acer negundo tree.jpg|thumb|Boxelder, Manitoba Maple. Tree. ND, USA.]]\n\nThis species prefers bright sunlight. It often grows on flood plains and other disturbed areas with ample water supply, such as [[riparian]] habitats. Human influence has greatly favoured this species; it grows around houses and in hedges, as well as on disturbed ground and vacant lots.\n\nSeveral [[bird]]s and some [[squirrel]]s feed on the seeds.  The [[evening grosbeak]] uses them extensively. The [[Maple Bug]] (also known as the Boxelder Bug) lays its [[egg]]s on all maples, but prefers this species.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nAlthough its weak wood, irregular form, and prolific seeding might make it seem like a poor choice for a landscape tree, ''A. negundo'' is one of the most common maples in cultivation and many interesting [[cultivar]]s have been developed, including:<ref name=\"gelderen\" />\n* 'Auratum'&nbsp;\u2013 yellowish leaves with smooth undersides\n* 'Aureomarginatum'&nbsp;\u2013 creamy yellow leaf margins\n* 'Baron'&nbsp;\u2013 Hardier & seedless variety\n* 'Elegans'&nbsp;\u2013 distinctively convex leaves\n* 'Flamingo'&nbsp;\u2013 pink and white [[variegation]] (very popular)\n* [[Acer negundo 'Pendulum'|'Pendulum']]&nbsp;\u2013 with weeping branches.\n* 'Variegatum'&nbsp;\u2013 creamy white leaf margins\n* 'Violaceum'&nbsp;\u2013 younger shoots and branches have bluish colour\n\n== Uses ==\nAlthough its light, close-grained, soft wood is considered undesirable for most uses, this tree has been considered as a commercial source of wood fiber, for use in [[fiberboard]].\n\nThere is some commercial use of the tree for various decorative applications, such as turned items (bowls, stem-ware, pens). Primarily burl wood and injured wood, where the primary reason is this wood's reaction to injury, where the injured wood develops a red stain.\n\n=== Use by Native Americans ===\nThe [[Navajo people|Navajo]] use the wood to make tubes for bellows.<ref>Elmore, Francis H. 1944 Ethnobotany of the Navajo.

Many of its features, especially its leaves, are quite variable in form. At maturity it often attains a height of around {{convert|15|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}. Its flowers, petioles, twigs and seeds are all red to varying degrees. Among these features, however, it is best known for its brilliant deep scarlet foliage in autumn.\n\nOver most of its range, red maple is adaptable to a very wide range of site conditions, perhaps more so than any other tree in eastern North America. It can be found growing in [[swamp]]s, on poor dry [[soil]]s, and most anywhere in between. It grows well from [[sea level]] to about {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Due to its attractive fall foliage and pleasing form, it is often used as a shade tree for landscapes. It is used commercially on a small scale for [[maple syrup]] production as well as for its medium to high quality lumber. It is also the [[List of U.S. state trees|State Tree of Rhode Island]]. The red maple can be considered weedy or invasive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Plants Profile for Acer rubrum|url=http://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=ACRU|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref> It is taking over forests in the eastern US, replacing traditional mainstays like oaks, as well as hickories and pines.<ref>{{cite web | title=Eastern Forests Change Color As Red Maples Proliferate | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/27/science/eastern-forests-change-color-as-red-maples-proliferate.html | publisher=New York Times | access-date=30 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Redmaplefoliage.jpg|thumb|Typical fall foliage in red maple country.]]\nThough ''A. rubrum'' is usually easy to identify, it is highly changeable in morphological characteristics.

The upper side of ''A. rubrum'''s leaf is light green and the underside is whitish and can be either [[glaucous]] or hairy. The leaf stalks are usually red and are up to {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long. Furthermore, the leaves can turn a brilliant red in autumn, but can also become yellow or orange on some individuals.\n\n[[File:2013-05-10 13 40 17 Immature foliage of Red Maple in Brendan T Byrne State Forest, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Immature foliage of Acer rubrum (Red Maple)]]\nThe [[twig]]s of the red maple are reddish in color and somewhat shiny with small [[lenticel]]s. Dwarf shoots are present on many branches. The [[bud]]s are usually blunt and greenish to reddish in color, generally with several loose scales. The lateral buds are slightly stalked, and in addition there may be collateral buds present as well. The buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their reddish tint.

It can be found from the south of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Nova Scotia]] and southern [[Quebec]] to the south west of Ontario, extreme southeastern [[Manitoba]] and northern [[Minnesota]]; south to [[Wisconsin]], [[Illinois]], [[Missouri]], eastern [[Oklahoma]], and eastern [[Texas]] in its western range; and east to [[Florida]]. It has the largest continuous range along the North American [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Coast]] of any tree that occurs in Florida. In total it ranges {{convert|2600|km|mi|abbr=on}} from north to south.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> The species is native to all regions of the United States east of the [[95th meridian west|95th meridian]]. The tree's range ends where the {{convert|-40|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} mean minimum [[isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]] begins, namely in southeastern [[Canada]]. ''A. rubrum'' is not present in the Prairie Peninsula of the northern [[Midwest]], the [[Western Gulf coastal grasslands|coastal prairie]] in southern [[Louisiana]] and southeastern Texas and the swamp prairie of the [[Florida Everglades]].<ref name=\"USDF\" /> The absence of red maple in the Prairie Peninsula is perhaps due to the specie's intolerance of fire.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/Volume_2/acer/rubrum.htm|title=Acer rubrum L.|last=Walters|first=Russell S|last2=Yawney|first2=Harry W.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn several other locations, the tree is absent from large areas but still present in a few specific habitats.

Moist mineral soil is best for germination of seeds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe red maple can grow in a variety of moist and dry biomes, from dry ridges and sunny, southwest-facing slopes to [[peat bog]]s and [[swamp]]s. While many types of tree prefer a south or north facing aspect, the red maple does not appear to have a preference.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> Its ideal conditions are in moderately well-drained, moist sites at low or intermediate elevations. However, it is nonetheless common in mountainous areas on relatively dry ridges, as well as on both the south and west sides of upper slopes. Furthermore, it is common in swampy areas, along the banks of slow moving streams, as well as on poorly drained flats and depressions. In northern [[Michigan]] and [[New England]], the tree is found on the tops of ridges, sandy or rocky upland and otherwise dry soils, as well as in nearly pure stands on moist soils and the edges of swamps. In the far south of its range, it is almost exclusively associated with swamps.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> Additionally, Red maple is one of the most drought-tolerant species of maple in the Carolinas.<ref name=\"Miller\">Miller, J.H., & Miller, K.V. (1999). ''Forest plants of the southeast and their wildlife uses''. Champaign, IL: Kings Time Printing.</ref>\n\nRed maple is far more abundant today than when Europeans first arrived in North America, where along with its cousin Silver Maple, it may have comprised a mere 5% of forest area and was confined mostly to [[riparian zone]]s.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> The density of the tree in many of these areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing, much of it due to human factors, especially suppression of wildfires which would kill shallow-rooted pioneer species like red maple, but leave mainline forest trees like oaks and hickories untouched.\n\nAdditionally, conservation efforts of the red maple have caused a major increase in the population of [[white-tailed deer]] since the mid-20th century. Deer will readily consume acorns, but leave maple seeds untouched, thus reducing the ability of oaks to regenerate compared to maples.<ref name=\"Perdue\" />  Because it can grow on a variety of substrates, has a high pH tolerance, and grows in both shade and sun, ''A. rubrum'' can be called a \"super-generalist,\" and it is predicted to replace historically dominant tree species in the eastern United States such as  [[oak]]s, [[hickory]]s and [[pine]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abrams|first=M.D.|year=1998|title=The Red Maple Paradox: what explains the widespread expansion of red maple in eastern forests?|url=|journal=BioScience|volume=48 |issue=5|pages=355\u2013364|via=}}</ref> Extensive use of red maple in landscaping has also contributed to the surge in the species' numbers as volunteer seedlings proliferate.

Its ability to thrive in a large number of habitats is largely due to its ability to produce [[root]]s to suit its site from a young age. In wet locations, red maple seedlings produce short [[taproot]]s with long and developed lateral roots, while on dry sites, they develop long taproots with significantly shorter laterals. The roots are primarily horizontal, however, forming in the upper {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} of the ground. Mature trees have woody roots up to {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. They are very tolerant of flooding, with one study showing that 60 days of flooding caused no leaf damage. At the same time, they are tolerant of drought due to their ability to stop growing under dry conditions by then producing a second growth flush when conditions later improve, even if growth has stopped for 2 weeks.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\n[[File:Maplekeys.jpg|left|thumb|Samaras from a specimen in [[Milford, New Hampshire]]]]\n''A. rubrum'' is one of the first plants to flower in spring. A crop of seeds is generally produced every year with a bumper crop often occurring every second year. A single tree between {{convert|5|and|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter can produce between 12,000 and 91,000 seeds in a season. A tree {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter was shown to produce nearly a million seeds.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> Red maple produces one of the smallest seeds of any of the maples.<ref name=\"Miller\" />  Fertilization has also been shown to significantly increase the seed yield for up to two years after application. The seeds are [[epigeal germination|epigeal]] and tend to germinate in early summer soon after they are released, assuming a small amount of light, moisture, and sufficient temperatures are present. If the seeds are densely shaded, then germination commonly does not occur until the next spring. Most seedlings do not survive in closed [[canopy (biology)|forest canopy]] situations. However, one- to four-year-old seedlings are common under dense canopy and though they eventually die if no light reaches them, they serve as a reservoir, waiting to fill any open area of the canopy above. Trees growing in a Zone 9 or 10 area such as Florida will usually die from cold damage if transferred up north, Canada, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York, even if the southern trees were planted with northern red maples. Due to their wide range, genetically the trees have adapted to the climatic differences.\n\n[[File:2015-04-13 10 38 10 Female Red Maple flowers on Madison Avenue in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Female flowers]]\nRed maple is able to increase its numbers significantly when associate trees are damaged by disease, cutting, or fire. One study found that 6 years after [[clearcutting]] a {{convert|3.4|ha|acre|abbr=off}} Oak-Hickory forest containing no red maples, the plot contained more than 2,200 red maple seedlings per hectare (900 per acre) taller than {{convert|1.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"USDF\" /> One of its associates, the [[black cherry]] (''[[Prunus serotina]]''), contains benzoic acid, which has been shown to be a potential [[allelopathic]] inhibitor of red maple growth. Red maple is one of the first species to start stem elongation. In one study, stem elongation was one-half completed in 1 week, after which growth slowed and was 90% completed within only 54 days. In good light and moisture conditions, the seedlings can grow {{convert|30|cm|ft|abbr=on}} in their first year and up to {{convert|60|cm|ft|abbr=on}} each year for the next few years making it a fast grower.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\nThe red maple is a used as a food source by several forms of wildlife. [[Elk]] and [[white-tailed deer]] in particular use the current season's growth of red maple as an important source of winter food. Several [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies and moths) utilize the leaves as food; see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on maples]].\n\n[[File:2015-04-12 16 31 55 Male Red Maple flowers on Bayberry Road in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|left|thumb|Male flowers]]\nDue to ''A. rubrum'''s very wide range, there is significant variation in hardiness, size, form, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, have the most reddish fall color, set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. In Florida, at the extreme south of the red maple's range, it is limited exclusively to swamplands. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief, frost-free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As a result of the variation there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation. This is especially useful for making urban [[cultivar]]s that require resistance from [[verticillium wilt]], air pollution, and drought.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\n[[File:Autumn Blaze Maple in Toronto.jpg|right|thumb|160px|''Acer \u00d7 freemanii'' 'Jeffersred' in Toronto]]\nRed maple frequently hybridizes with [[Silver Maple]]; the [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]], known as Freeman's Maple ''Acer x freemanii'', is intermediate between the parents.\n\n=== Allergenic potential ===\nThe allergenic potential of red maples varies widely based on the cultivar.\n\nThe following cultivars are completely [[male]] and are highly allergenic, with an [[OPALS (Ogren Plant Allergy Scale)|OPALS]] allergy scale rating of 8 or higher:<ref name=Ogren>{{cite book|last1=Ogren|first1=Thomas|title=The Allergy-Fighting Garden|date=2015|publisher=Ten Speed Press|location=Berkeley, CA|isbn=978-1-60774-491-7|pages=54\u201355}}</ref>\n\n* 'Autumn Flame' ('Flame')\n* 'Autumn Spire'\n* 'Columnare' ('Pyramidale')\n* 'Firedance' ('Landsburg')\n* 'Karpick'\n* 'Northwood'\n* 'October Brilliance'\n* 'Sun Valley'\n* 'Tiliford'\n\nThe following cultivars have an OPALS allergy scale rating of 3 or lower; they are completely [[female]] trees, and have low potential for causing allergies:<ref name=\"Ogren\" />\n\n* 'Autumn Glory'\n* 'Bowhall'\n* 'Davey Red'\n* 'Doric'\n* 'Embers'\n* 'Festival'\n* 'October Glory'\n* 'Red Skin'\n* 'Red Sunset' ('Franksred')\n\n=== Toxicity ===\nThe leaves of red maple, especially when dead or wilted, are extremely [[List of plants poisonous to equines|toxic to horses]].

The ingestion of 700&nbsp;grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate and depth of breathing, increased heart rate, [[jaundice]], dark brown urine, [[horse colic|colic]], [[laminitis]], coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of [[methylene blue]] or mineral oil and [[activated carbon]] in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as [[blood transfusion]]s, fluid support, [[diuretic]]s, and anti-oxidants such as [[Vitamin C]].

The wood is close grained and as such it is similar to that of ''A. saccharum'', but its texture is softer, less dense, and has a poorer figure and machining qualities. High grades of wood from the red maple can nonetheless be substituted for hard maple, particularly when it comes to making [[furniture]]. As a soft maple, the wood tends to shrink more during the drying process than with the hard maples.\n\nRed maple is also used for the production of [[maple syrup]], though the hard maples ''[[Acer saccharum]]'' (sugar maple) and ''[[Acer nigrum]]'' (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the red maple, as well as those of the ''[[Acer saccharinum]]'' (silver maple), ''[[Acer negundo]]'' (boxelder), and ''[[Acer platanoides]]'' (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of red maple and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, red maple can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.<ref name=\"USDF\" />\n\nRed maple is a medium quality firewood,<ref>{{cite web|title=Heating With Wood: Species Characteristics and Volumes|author=Michael Kuhns and Tom Schmidt|date=n.d.|publisher=UtahState University Cooperative Extension|url=http://extension.usu.edu/forestry/HomeTown/General_HeatingWithWood.htm}}</ref> possessing less heat energy, nominally 5.4 MJ/m\u00b3 (18.7 million BTU (mbtu) per cord), than other hardwoods such as Ash: 7 MJ/m\u00b3 (24 mbtu/cord), Oak: 7 MJ/m\u00b3 (24 mbtu/cord), or Birch: 5.8 MJ/m\u00b3 (20 mbtu/cord).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of plants poisonous to equines]]\n* [[List of foods made from maple]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikispecies}}\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ACRU NRCS: United States Department of Agriculture Plants Profile and map: ''Acer rubrum'']\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/acru.htm ''Acer rubrum'' images from Vanderbilt University]\n*[http://www.portraitoftheearth.com/trees/redsilvermaple.html Portrait of the Earth, Winter ID photos]\n{{Commons category|position=left|Acer rubrum}}\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Acer|rubrum]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Flora of Southeastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Symbols of Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Plants used in bonsai]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

It is a highly adaptable tree, although it has higher sunlight requirements than other maple trees.\n\n[[Image:Silver Maple Acer saccharinum Leaves 2598px.jpg|thumb|left|Silver maple leaves]]\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are [[leaf shape|simple]] and palmately veined, 8\u201316&nbsp;cm long and 6\u201312&nbsp;cm broad, with deep angular notches between the five lobes. The 5\u201312&nbsp;cm long, slender stalks of the leaves mean that even a light breeze can produce a striking effect as the downy silver undersides of the leaves are exposed. The autumn color is less pronounced than in many maples, generally ending up a pale yellow, although some specimens can produce a more brilliant yellow and even orange and red colorations. The tree has a tendency to color and drop its leaves slightly earlier in autumn than other maples.\n\n[[Image:Soft Maple Helicopter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Samara (fruit)|Samaras]] and leaves forming in April.]]\nThe [[flower]]s are in dense clusters, produced before the leaves in early spring,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/get_IJM.pl?key=10696|title=Jepson Flora Project}}</ref> with the [[seed]]s maturing in early summer. The fruit are [[Samara (fruit)|samaras]], each containing a single seed, and winged, in pairs, small (5\u201310&nbsp;mm diameter), the wing about 3\u20135&nbsp;cm long. The fruit are the largest of any native maple. Although the wings provide for some transport by air, the fruit are heavy and are also transported by water. Silver Maple and its close cousin [[Red Maple]] are the only ''Acer'' species which produce their fruit crop in spring instead of fall. The seeds of both trees have no epigeal dormancy and will germinate immediately.\n\nOn mature trunks, the bark is gray and shaggy. On branches and young trunks, the bark is smooth and silvery gray.\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\n[[File:2014-11-02 15 41 21 Silver Maple foliage during autumn along Glen Mawr Drive in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|thumb|right|Typical yellow autumn leaf color]]\n[[File:2014-11-02 15 14 57 Silver Maple foliage during autumn along Pingree Avenue in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|right|thumb|Atypical reddish autumn color; this sort of coloration is sporadic and uncommon]]\nWildlife uses the silver maple in various ways. In many parts of the eastern U.S., the large rounded buds are one of the primary food sources for [[squirrels]] during the spring, after many acorns and nuts have sprouted and the squirrels' food is scarce. The seeds are also a food source for squirrels, [[chipmunk]]s and birds. The bark can be eaten by [[beaver]] and [[deer]].

It is highly tolerant of urban situations, and is frequently planted next to streets. However, its quick growth produces brittle wood, and is commonly damaged in storms. The silver maple's root system is shallow and fibrous, and easily invades septic fields and old drain pipes; it can also crack sidewalks and foundations. It is a vigorous resprouter, and if not pruned, will often grow with multiple trunks. Although it naturally is found near water, it can grow on drier ground if planted there. In ideal natural conditions, ''A. saccharinum'' may live up 130 years, but in urban environments often 80 or less.\n\nFollowing WWII, silver maples were commonly used as a landscaping and street tree in suburban housing developments and cities due to their rapid growth, especially as a replacement for the blighted [[American Elm]]. However, they fell out of favor for this purpose because of brittle wood, unattractive form when not pruned or trained, and tendency to produce large numbers of volunteer seedlings, and nowadays it is much less popular for this purpose to the point where some towns and cities banned its use as a street tree.\n\nIt is also commonly cultivated outside its native range, showing tolerance of a wide range of climates, growing successfully as far north as central [[Norway]] and south to [[Orlando, Florida]]. It can thrive in a [[Mediterranean climate]], as at [[Jerusalem]] and [[Los Angeles]], if summer water is provided. It is also grown in temperate parts of the [[Southern Hemisphere]]: [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]], the [[Brazil|southern states of Brazil]] (as well as in a few low-temperature locations within the states of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Minas Gerais]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe silver maple is closely related to the [[red maple]] (''[[Acer rubrum]]''), and can hybridise with it. The [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] variation is known as the Freeman maple (''Acer'' x ''freemanii''). The Freeman maple is a popular ornamental tree in [[park]]s and large [[garden]]s, combining the fast growth of silver maple with the less brittle wood, less invasive roots, and the beautiful bright red fall foliage of the red maple.\n\nThe silver maple is the favoured [[Host (biology)|host]] of the [[Parasitism|parasitic]] [[Pulvinaria innumerabilis|cottony maple scale]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} and the maple bladder gall mite ''[[Vasates quadripedes]]''.<ref name=\"Redfern\">{{cite book|author1=Redfern M. |author2=Shirley P.R. |author3=Bloxham M. |title=British Plant Galls (Second Edition)|year=2011|publisher=Field Studies Council|location=Preston Montford|isbn=978 1 85153 284 1|page=23}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nIn the English Christmas carol, \"Wassail, Wassail All Over the Town\", the \"white maple\" in  [[Wassailing#Wassail bowls|\"Our bowl, it is made of the white maple tree\"]] refers not to the silver (white) maple, but the wood of the sycamore maple, ''[[Acer pseudoplatanus]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=ACSA2 United States Department of Agriculture Plants Profile: ''Acer saccharinum'']\n*[http://www.hort.uconn.edu/plants/a/acesac/acesac1.html University of Connecticut Plant Database: Silver Maple]\n*[http://wildwnc.org/trees/Acer_saccharinum.html Trees of Western North Carolina: Silver Maple]\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/acsa2.htm ''Acer saccharinum'' images from Vanderbilt University]\n*[http://www.google.com/tree/Silver_maple.html Trees of Western North Carolina: Silver]\n* [http://www.portraitoftheearth.com/trees/redsilvermaple.html Portrait of the Earth, Winter ID pictures]\n*[http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/acer-saccharinum-silver-maple-native-range-map.php Plant Maps, Interactive Distribution Map for ''Acer saccharinum'']\n*[http://www.tropicos.org/Image/88052 photo of herbarium specimen at Missouri Botanical Garden, collected in Missouri in 1989]\n{{Commons category|Acer saccharinum}}\n\n[[Category:Acer|saccharinum]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Flora of Southeastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Plants used in Native American cuisine]]\n[[Category:Plants used in traditional Native American medicine]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

When healthy, the sugar maple can live for over 400 years.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are deciduous, up to {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and equally wide,<ref name=nopd /> with five palmate lobes. The basal lobes are relatively small, while the upper lobes are larger and deeply notched. In contrast with the angular notching of the [[silver maple]], however, the notches tend to be rounded at their interior. The fall color is often spectacular, ranging from bright yellow through orange to fluorescent red-orange, although they look best in the northern part of its range. Sugar maples also have a tendency to color unevenly in fall. In some trees, all colors above can be seen at the same time. They also share a tendency with [[red maple]]s for certain parts of a mature tree to change color weeks ahead of or behind the remainder of the tree. The leaf buds are pointy and brown-colored. The recent year's growth twigs are green, and turn dark brown.\n\n[[File:Acer saccharum seeds.jpg|Fruit of ''Acer saccharum''|thumb|left|A pair of samaras]]\nThe [[flower]]s are in [[panicle]]s of five to 10 together, yellow-green and without [[petal]]s; flowering occurs in early spring after 30\u201355 [[growing degree day]]s. The sugar maple will generally begin flowering when it is between 10 and 15 years old. The fruit is a pair of [[Samara (fruit)|samara]]s (winged seeds).

The western American [[bigtooth maple]] (''Acer grandidentatum'') is also treated as a variety or subspecies of sugar maple by some botanists.\n\nThe sugar maple is also often confused with the [[Norway maple]], though they are not closely related within the genus. The sugar maple is most easily identified by clear sap in the leaf [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] (the Norway maple has white sap), brown, sharp-tipped buds (the Norway maple has blunt, green or reddish-purple buds), and shaggy bark on older trees (the Norway maple bark has small grooves). Also, the leaf lobes of the sugar maple have a more triangular shape, in contrast to the squarish lobes of the Norway maple.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAlthough many people think a red sugar [[maple leaf]] is featured on the [[flag of Canada]], the official maple leaf does not belong to any particular maple species; although it perhaps most closely resembles a sugar maple leaf of all the maple species in Canada, the leaf on the flag was specially designed to be as identifiable as possible on a flag waving in the wind without regard to whether it resembled a particular species' foliage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/df1_e.cfm|title=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/df1_e.cfm|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Maple birch2.jpg|thumb|left|Sugar maple\u2013yellow birch forest, [[Jacques-Cartier National Park]], Quebec, Canada]]\nThe sugar maple is an extremely important species to the ecology of many forests in the northern United States and Canada. Pure stands are common, and it is a major component of the [[northern hardwood forest|northern]] and midwestern U.S. hardwood forests.\n\nSugar maple is native to areas with cooler climates. In northern parts of its range, January temperatures average about {{convert|-18|C|F}} and July temperatures about {{convert|16|C|F}}; in southern parts, January temperatures average about {{convert|10|C|F}} and July temperatures average almost {{convert|27|C|F}}.<ref>{{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Acer |species=saccharum |first1=Richard M. |last1=Godman |first2=Harry W. |last2=Yawney |first3=Carl H. |last3=Tubbs}}</ref>\n\n''Acer saccharum'' is among the most [[shade tolerant]] of large deciduous trees. Its shade tolerance is exceeded only by the [[striped maple]], a smaller tree. Like other maples, its shade tolerance is manifested in its ability to germinate and persist under a closed canopy as an understory plant, and respond with rapid growth to the increased light formed by a gap in the canopy. The sugar maple can grow comfortably in any type of soil except sand.\n\nSugar maples engage in [[Hydraulic redistribution|hydraulic lift]], drawing water from lower soil layers and exuding that water into upper, drier soil layers. This not only benefits the tree itself, but also many other plants growing around it.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n1n685611216p3l0/ |title=Hydraulic lift and its influence on the water content of the rhizosphere: an example from sugar maple, Acer saccharum |date= |accessdate=2011-03-03 |doi=10.1007/BF00334651 |volume=108 |journal=Oecologia |pages=273\u2013278}}</ref>\n\nHuman influences have contributed to the decline of the sugar maple in many regions. Its role as a species of mature forests has led it to be replaced by more opportunistic species in areas where forests are cut over. The sugar maple also exhibits a greater susceptibility to pollution than other species of maple. [[Acid rain]] and [[soil acidification]] are some of the primary contributing factors to [[maple decline]]. Also, the increased use of salt over the last several decades on streets and roads for deicing purposes has decimated the sugar maple's role as a street tree.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn some parts of New England, particularly near urbanized areas, the sugar maple is being displaced by the [[Acer platanoides|Norway maple]]. The Norway maple is also highly shade tolerant, but is considerably more tolerant of urban conditions, resulting in the sugar maple's replacement in those area. In addition, Norway maple produces much larger crops of seeds, allowing it to out-compete native species.\n\n== Cultivation and uses ==\n\n=== Maple syrup ===\n[[File:Maple sap buckets - Beaver Meadow Audubon Center.jpg|thumb|left|Collecting sap from sugar maples]]\nThe sugar maple is one of the most important [[Trees of Canada|Canadian trees]], being, with the black maple, the major source of sap for making [[maple syrup]].<ref name=Heilingmann>{{cite web|last=Heilingmann |first=Randall B |title=Hobby Maple Syrup Production (F-36-02) |url=http://ohioline.osu.edu/for-fact/0036.html |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20020917225722/http://ohioline.osu.edu/for-fact/0036.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-09-17 |publisher=Ohio State University }}</ref> Other maple species can be used as a sap source for maple syrup, but some have lower sugar contents and/or produce more cloudy syrup than these two.<ref name=Heilingmann /> Some other trees ([[Betula|birch]], [[Fraxinus|ash]], etc.) can yield a useful syrup as well, though with different flavors.<ref>Gibbons, E. 1962. Stalking the Wild Asparagus. David McKay.</ref>\nIn maple syrup production from ''Acer saccharum'', the sap is extracted from the trees using a tap placed into a hole drilled through the phloem, just inside the bark. The collected sap is then boiled. As the sap boils, the water is evaporated off and the syrup left behind. 40 litres of maple sap are required to be boiled to produce only 1 litre of pure syrup. This is the reason for the high cost of pure maple syrup.\n\n=== Timber ===\n[[File:Houghilluminated.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Ultra-thin sugar maple sections from [[Romeyn Beck Hough]]'s ''American Woods''.

Trees with wavy woodgrain, which can occur in curly, quilted, and \"[[birdseye maple]]\" forms, are especially valued. Maple is also the wood used for [[basketball courts]], including the floors used by the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and it is a popular wood for [[baseball bats]], along with [[White Ash|white ash]]. It is also widely used in the manufacture of musical instruments, such as the members of the violin family (sides and back), guitars (neck), and drum shells. It is also quite flexible and makes excellent [[Bow (archery)|archery bows]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nCanadian maple, often referred to as \"Canadian hardrock maple\", is prized for [[pool cue]]s, especially the shafts. Some production-line cues will use lower-quality maple wood with cosmetic issues, such as \"sugar marks\", which are most often light brown discolorations caused by sap in the wood. The best shaft wood has a very consistent grain, with no marks or discoloration. Sugar marks usually do not affect how the cue plays, but are not as high quality as those without it. This wood is also used in decks for its strength.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Urban planting ===\n[[File:2014-11-02 15 25 30 Sugar Maple during autumn along Patton Drive in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|Sugar maple in a suburban landscape]]\n[[File:2014-11-02 15 08 37 Sugar Maple foliage during autumn along Parkway Avenue in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|right|Closeup of autumn foliage]]\nThe sugar maple was a favorite street and park tree during the 19th century because it was easy to propagate and transplant, is fairly fast-growing, and has beautiful fall color.{{contradiction inline |reason= [[Acer saccharum#Ecology]]: \"'' However, like most climax forest species, sugar maple is not well-suited for landscaping due to its large size, relatively slow growth, and dense network of fibrous surface roots which can make gardening under it difficult due to their monopolization of moisture and soil nutrients.''\"|date=February 2015}} As noted above however, it proved too delicate to continue in that role after the rise of automobile-induced pollution and was replaced by [[Platanus occidentalis]] and other hardier species. The shade and the shallow, fibrous [[root]]s may interfere with grass growing under the trees. Deep, well-drained [[loam]] is the best rooting medium, although sugar maples can grow well on sandy soil which has a good buildup of [[humus]]. Light (or loose) clay soils are also well known to support sugar maple growth. Poorly drained areas are unsuitable, and the species is especially short-lived on flood-prone clay flats.

The [[leaf|leaves]] are opposite and simple, {{convert|6|\u2013|10|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long and wide, with 3 or 5 shallow broad lobes. They are coarsely and irregularly toothed with a light green hairless surface and a finely hairy underside.

The bark contains [[tannin]]s, which are used in tanning leather. Indigenous peoples infused the piths of young twigs to produce treatments for eye irritation and made poultices from boiled root chips.

It ranged from [[Maine]] and [[southern Ontario]] to [[Mississippi]], and from the [[Atlantic]] coast to the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and the [[Ohio Valley]]. It has several related [[chestnut]] species, such as the European [[sweet chestnut]], [[Castanea mollissima|Chinese chestnut]], and [[Japanese chestnut]], which are distinguishable from the American species by a few morphological traits, such as leaf shape, petiole length and nut size. ''C. dentata'' was once one of the most common trees in the [[Northeastern United States]]. In [[Pennsylvania]] alone, it is estimated to have comprised 25\u201330% of all hardwoods. The tree's huge population was due to a combination of rapid growth and a large annual seed crop in comparison to oaks which do not reliably produce sizable numbers of acorns every year. Nut production begins when ''C. dentata'' is 7\u20138 years old.\n\n''C. dentata'' can be best identified by the larger and more widely spaced saw-teeth on the edges of its leaves, as indicated by the scientific name ''dentata'', Latin for \"toothed\". The [[leaf|leaves]], which are {{convert|14|\u2013|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|7|\u2013|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} broad, also tend to average slightly shorter and broader than those of the sweet chestnut. The blight-resistant Chinese chestnut is now the most commonly planted chestnut species in the US, while the European chestnut is the source of commercial nuts in recent decades. It can be distinguished from the American chestnut by its hairy twig tips which are in contrast to the hairless twigs of the American chestnut. The chestnuts are in the beech family along with [[beech]] and [[oak]], but are not closely related to the horse-chestnut, which is in the family [[Sapindaceae]].\n\nThe chestnut is monoecious, producing many small, pale green (nearly white) male flowers found tightly occurring along 6 to 8 inch long catkins. The female parts are found near base of the catkins (near twig) and appear in late spring to early summer. Like all members of the Fagaceae family, American chestnut is self-incompatible and requires two trees for pollination, which can be any member of the Castanea genus.\n\nThe American chestnut is a prolific bearer of [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], usually with three nuts enclosed in each spiny, green burr, and lined in tan velvet. The nuts develop through late summer, with the burrs opening and falling to the ground near the first fall frost.\n\nThe American chestnut was a very important tree for wildlife, providing much of the fall [[mast (botany)|mast]] for species such as [[white-tailed deer]] and [[wild turkey]] and, formerly, the [[passenger pigeon]]. [[American black bear|Black bears]] were also known to eat the nuts to fatten up for the winter. The American chestnut also contains more [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[potassium]] and [[magnesium]] in its leaves when compared to other trees that share its habitat. This means they return more nutrients to the soil which helps with the growth of other plants, animals, and [[microorganism]]s.<ref name=blight>Jabr, Ferris.

The disease was first noticed on American chestnut trees in what was then the New York Zoological Park, now known as the [[Bronx Zoo]], in 1904, by chief forester [[Hermann Merkel]].

Huge planted chestnut trees can be found in [[Sherwood, Oregon]], as the [[Mediterranean climate]] of the West Coast discourages the fungus, which relies on hot, humid summer weather.  American chestnut thrives as far north as [[Revelstoke, British Columbia]].\n\nAt present, it is believed that survival of ''C. dentata'' for more than a decade in its native range is almost impossible.  The fungus uses [[northern red oak]] as a host, and while the oak itself is unaffected, any American chestnuts nearby will quickly succumb.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} In addition, the hundreds of chestnut stumps and \"living stools\" dotting eastern woodlands may still contain active pathogens.\n\n==Attempts at revitalization==\nSeveral organizations are attempting to breed blight-resistant chestnut trees. The [[American Chestnut Cooperators Foundation]] breeds surviving American chestnuts, which have shown some native resistance to blight, and the [[Canadian Chestnut Council]] is an organization attempting to reintroduce the trees in Canada, primarily in [[Ontario]]. A technique called [[backcrossing]] is being used by [[The American Chestnut Foundation]] in an attempt to restore the American chestnut to its original habitat.\n\n===Intercrossing Surviving American Chestnuts===\n[[File:Floyda.jpg|thumb|Large Surviving Blight Resistant American Chestnut in its natural range.

Both Elkins and Griffin have written extensively about the American chestnut.<ref name=griffin>[http://www.accf-online.org/biblio.html \"Bibliography.\"] ''www.accf-online.org.'' Retrieved January 11, 2016.</ref>  They believe that by making intercrosses among resistant American chestnuts from many locations, they will continue to improve upon the levels of blight resistance to make an American chestnut that can compete in the forest. Griffin, who has been involved with American chestnut restoration for many years,<ref name=griffin/> developed a scale for assessing levels of blight resistance, which made it possible to make selections scientifically. He inoculated five-year-old chestnuts with a standard lethal strain of the blight fungus and measured growth of the cankers. Chestnuts with no resistance to blight make rapid-growing, sunken cankers that are deep and kill tissue right to the wood. Resistant chestnuts make slow-growing, swollen cankers that are superficial: live tissue can be recovered under these cankers. The level of blight resistance is judged by periodic measurement of cankers. Grafts from large survivors of the blight epidemic were evaluated following inoculations, and controlled crosses among resistant American chestnut trees were made beginning in 1980. The first \"All-American intercrosses\" were planted in Virginia Tech's Martin American Chestnut Planting in [[Giles County, Virginia]], and in [[Beckley, West Virginia]]. They were inoculated in 1990 and evaluated in 1991 and 1992. Nine of the trees showed resistance equal to their parents, and four of these had resistance comparable to hybrids in the same test.<ref name=griffin/><ref name=elkins>Griffin, G.J., J.R. Elkins, D.

It is closely related to the Asian species ''[[Aralia elata]]'', a more commonly cultivated species with which it is easily confused.\n\n==Description==\n''Aralia spinosa'' is an aromatic spiny [[deciduous]] [[shrub]] or small tree growing {{convert|2|\u2013|8|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, with a simple or occasionally branched stem with very large bipinnate [[leaf|leaves]] {{convert|70|\u2013|120|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The trunks are up to {{convert|15|\u2013|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, with the plants umbrella-like in habit with open crowns. The young stems are stout and thickly covered with sharp spines. The plants generally grow in clusters of branchless trunks, although stout wide-spreading branches are occasionally produced.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nThe [[flower]]s are creamy-white, individually small (about 5&nbsp;mm or 0.2&nbsp;in across) but produced in large composite [[panicle]]s {{convert|30|\u2013|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; flowering is in the late summer. The [[fruit]] is a purplish-black [[berry (botany)|berry]] {{convert|6|\u2013|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, ripening in the fall. The roots are thick and fleshy.\n\nThe doubly or triply compound leaves are the largest of any temperate tree in the continental United States, often about a meter (three feet) long and 60&nbsp;cm (two feet) wide, with leaflets about {{convert|5|\u2013|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The petioles are prickly, with swollen bases. In the autumn the leaves turn to a peculiar bronze red touched with yellow which makes the tree conspicuous and attractive.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nThe habit of growth and general appearance of ''Aralia spinosa'' and related tree-forming ''Aralia'' species are unique. It is usually found as a group of unbranched stems, rising to the height of {{convert|3.5|\u2013|6|m|ft|abbr=on}}, which bear upon their summits a crowded cluster of doubly or triply compound leaves, thus giving to each stem a certain tropical [[palm (plant)|palm]]-like appearance. In the south it is said to reach the height of {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}}, still retaining its palm-like aspect. However, further north, the slender, swaying, palm-like appearance is most characteristic of younger plants that have not been damaged by winter storms.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n[[File:Aralia spinosa.jpg|thumb|The trunk, showing the bark, leaf scars, and spines.]]\n* Bark: Light brown, divided into rounded broken ridges. Branchlets one-half to two-thirds of an inch in diameter, armed with stout, straight or curved, scattered prickles and nearly encircled by narrow leaf scars. At first light yellow brown, shining and dotted, later light brown.\n* Wood: Brown with yellow streaks; light, soft, brittle, close-grained.\n* Winter buds: Terminal bud chestnut brown, one-half to three-fourths of an inch long, conical, blunt; axillary buds flattened, triangular, one-fourth of an inch in length.\n* Leaves: Clustered at the end of the branches, compound, bi- and tri-pinnate, three to four feet long, two and a half feet broad. The pinnae are unequally pinnate, having five or six pairs of leaflets and a long stalked terminal leaflet; these leaflets are often themselves pinnate. The last leaflets are ovate, two to three inches long, wedge-shaped or rounded at base, serrate or dentate, acute; midrib and primary veins prominent. They come out of the bud a bronze green, shining, somewhat hairy; when full grown are dark green above, pale beneath; midribs frequently furnished with prickles. Petioles stout, light brown, eighteen to twenty inches in length, clasping, armed with prickles. Stipules acute, one-half inch long.\n* Flowers: July, August. Perfect or [[polygamomonoecious]], cream white, borne in many-flowered umbels arranged in compound panicles, forming a terminal racemose cluster, three to four feet in length which rises, solitary or two or three together, above the spreading leaves. Bracts and bractlets lanceolate, acute, persistent.\n* Calyx: Calyx tube coherent with the ovary, minutely five-toothed.\n* Corolla: Petals five, white, inserted on margin of the disk, acute, slightly inflexed at the apex, imbricate in bud.\n* Stamens: Five, inserted on margin of the disk, alternate with the petals; filaments thread-like; anthers oblong, attached on the back, introrse, two-celled; cells opening longitudinally.\n* Pistil: Ovary inferior, five-celled; styles five, connivent; stigmas capitate.\n* Fruit: Berry-like drupe, globular, black, one-fourth of an inch long, five-angled, crowned with the blackened styles. Flesh thin, dark.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Aralia spinosa'' is widespread in the eastern [[United States]], ranging from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Florida]] along the Atlantic coast, and westward to [[Ohio]], [[Illinois]], and [[Texas]]. It prefers a deep moist soil.<ref name=Keeler />  The plants typically grow in the forest [[Understory]] or at the edges of forests, often forming [[vegetative reproduction|clonal]] thickets by sprouting from the roots.\n\nThis tree was admired by the [[Iroquois]] because of its usefulness, and for its rarity. The Iroquois would take the saplings of the tree and plant them near their villages and on islands, so that animals wouldn't eat the valuable fruit. The fruit was used in many of the natives' foods. The women would take the flowers and put them in their hair because of the lemony smell. The flowers could also be traded for money.\n\n==Uses==\n\nThe young leaves can be eaten if gathered before the prickles harden. They are then chopped finely and cooked as a [[potherb]].\n\n''Aralia spinosa'' was introduced into cultivation in 1688 and is still grown for its decorative foliage, prickly stems, large showy flower [[panicle]]s [clusters], and distinctive fall color. These plants are slow growing, tough and durable, do well in urban settings, but bear numerous prickles on their stems, petioles, and leaflets. These plants can be propagated from seeds or root cuttings.<ref>[[Janet Meakin Poor|Poor, Janet Meakin]], and Nancy P. Brewster. 1994. ''Plants that merit attention Vol 2, Shrubs''.

In younger trees the bark is characteristic of most [[birch]]es, with smooth bark and distinct horizontal [[lenticel]]s. It is sometimes mistakenly identified as a [[Prunus|cherry]] tree. In some older tree specimens the [[bark]] can (unlike most birches) develop vertical cracks into irregular scaly plates revealing rough darkish brown bark patterns. This, however, does not occur in all specimens.  The twigs, when scraped, have a strong scent of wintergreen due to [[methyl salicylate]], which is produced in the bark. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, ovate, {{convert|5|to(-)|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4|to(-)|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} broad, with a finely serrated margin. The [[flower]]s are [[Anemophily|wind-pollinated]] [[catkin]]s {{convert|3|to(-)|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the male catkins pendulous, the female catkins erect. The [[fruit]], maturing in fall, is composed of numerous tiny winged [[seed]]s packed between the catkin bracts. Seed production mainly occurs in trees that are between 40 and 70 years old, although light crops may occur as early as 20 years. The average lifespan of ''B. lenta'' is 100 years, with a maximum of 150.\n\n''Betula lenta'' was used commercially in the past for production of oil of wintergreen before modern industrial synthesis of the oil; the tree's name reflects the wintergreen scent of the shoots.\n\nThe [[Plant sap|sap]] flows about a month later than [[maple]] sap, and much faster. The trees can be tapped in a similar fashion, but must be gathered about three times more often. [[Birch sap]] can be boiled the same as maple sap, but its syrup is stronger (like [[molasses]]).\n\nThe leaves of this species serve as food for some [[caterpillar]]s (see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on birches]]) and the solitary leaf-cutter bee ''[[Megachile rubi]]'' cuts pieces from the leaves to line the cells of its nest.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Eickwort, George C. |author2=Matthews, Robert W. |author3=Carpenter, James |year=1981 |title=Observations on the Nesting Behavior of ''Megachile rubi'' and ''M. texana'' with a Discussion of the Significance of Soil Nesting in the Evolution of Megachilid Bees (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) |journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society  |volume=54 |issue=3 |pages=557\u2013570 |jstor=25084194 }}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nImage:BetulaLentaBark.jpg|Closeup of bark\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{Commonscat-inline|Betula lenta}}\n*[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233500250 Flora of North America: ''Betula lenta''] [http://www.efloras.org/object_page.aspx?object_id=5742&flora_id=1 RangeMap:]\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/bele.htm ''Betula lenta'' images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu]\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n[[Category:Betula|lenta]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Trees of Quebec]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Medicinal plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Trees of humid continental climate]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]",

The most southerly stand in the Western United States is located in Long Canyon in the [[Boulder, Colorado|City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks]]. This is an isolated Pleistocene [[relict]] that most likely reflects the southern reach of boreal vegetation into the area during the last Ice Age.<ref>{{cite journal|url = http://www.bouldercolorado.gov/files/openspace/pdf_gis/IndependentResearchReports/249_Cooper_David_Ecological.pdf|title = Ecological Survey of the City of Boulder, Colorado Mountain Parks|last = Cooper|first = David J.|publisher = City of [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] Parks and Recreation Department|format = PDF|page = 16|date = Spring 1984|accessdate = 2011-09-16}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nIn Alaska, paper birch often naturally grows in pure stands with itself or with [[black spruce|black]] or [[white spruce]]. In the eastern and central regions of its range it is often associated with [[red spruce]] and [[balsam fir]].<ref name=\"fed\" /> It may also be associated with [[Big-Toothed Aspen|big-toothed aspen]], [[yellow birch]], ''[[Betula populifolia]]'', and [[Acer (plant)|maples]]\n\nShrubs often associated with paper birch in the eastern part of its range include: beaked hazel (''[[Corylus cornuta]]''), common bearberry (''[[Arctostaphylos uva-ursi]]''), dwarf bush-honeysuckle (''[[Diervilla lonicera]]''), wintergreen (''[[Gaultheria procumbens]]''), wild sarsaparilla (''[[Aralia nudicaulis]]''), blueberries (''[[Vaccinium]] spp.''), raspberries and blackberries (''[[Rubus]] spp.''), elderberry (''[[Sambucus]] spp.''), and hobblebush (''[[Viburnum alnifolium]]'').\n\n=== Successional relationships ===\n[[File:Boreal forestfire.jpg|thumb|left|A prescribed fire in a black spruce-paper birch-quaking aspen community in boreal Alaska.]]\n\n''Betula papyrifera'' is a [[pioneer species]] meaning it is often one of the first trees to grow in an area after other trees are removed by some sort of disturbance. Typical disturbances colonized by paper birch are [[wildfire]], [[avalanche]], or [[windthrow]] areas where the wind has blown down all trees. When it grows in these pioneer, or early [[secondary succession|successional]], woodlands it often forms stands of trees where it is the only species.<ref name=\"fs\">{{cite web|title=Betula papyrifera|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/betpap/all.html|website=www.fs.fed.us|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nPaper birch is considered well adapted to fires it recovers quickly by means of reseeding the area or regrowth from the burned tree. The lightweight seeds are easily carried by the wind to burned areas where they quickly germinate and grow into new trees. Paper birch is adapted to ecosystems where fires occur every 50\u2013150 years<ref name=\"fs\" /> For example, it is frequently an early invader after fire in [[black spruce]] [[boreal forest]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 |title=Black Spruce (Picea mariana) |first=C.

Since these stands are fire resistant they may become seed trees to reseed the area around them which was burned. However, in dry periods paper birch is flammable and will burn rapidly.<ref name=\"fs\" /> As the bark is flammable it will often burn and may [[Girdling|girdle]] the tree.\n\n=== Wildlife ===\nBirch bark is a winter staple food for [[moose]]. The nutritional quality is poor due to the large quantities of [[lignin]], which make digestion difficult, but is important to wintering moose because of its sheer abundance.<ref name=\"fs\" /> Moose prefer paper birch over [[aspen]], [[alder]], and [[balsam poplar]] but they prefer willow (''[[salix|Salix spp.]]'') over birch and the other species listed. Although moose consume large amounts of paper birch in the winter, if they were to only eat paper birch they may die.<ref name=\"fs\" />\n\nAlthough [[white-tailed deer]] consider birch a \"secondary-choice food\", it is an important dietary component. In Minnesota, white-tailed deer eat considerable amounts of paper birch leaves in the fall. [[Snowshoe hare]]s browse paper birch seedlings.<ref name=\"fs\" /> [[North American porcupine|Porcupines]] feed on the inner bark of the tree and beavers will also feed on the tree. The seeds of paper birch are an important part of the diet of many birds and small mammals including [[chickadee]]s, [[redpoll]]s, [[vole]]s, and [[ruffed grouse]]. [[Yellow bellied sapsucker]]s drill holes in the bark of paper birch to get at the sap, this is one of their favorite trees for feeding on.<ref name=\"fs\" />\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:White birch at Acadia National Park, ME IMG 2177.JPG|200px|thumb|right|White birch at [[Acadia National Park]] in [[Maine]]]]\n\n''Betula papyrifera'' has a soft,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} yet moderately heavy, white wood.

The raw sap contains 0.9% carbohydrates ([[glucose]], [[fructose]], [[sucrose]])<ref name=\"fed\" /> as compared to 2-3% within [[sugar maple]] sap. The sap flows later in the season than maples.  Currently, only a few small scale operations in Alaska and [[Yukon]] currently produce birch syrup from this species.<ref name=\"fed\" />\n\n=== Bark ===\n[[File:Ecorce de bouleau.JPG|thumb|left|Peeling bark]]\nIts bark is an excellent fire starter; it ignites at high temperatures even when wet.

[[Nymph (biology)|Nymphs]] of the [[pineapple gall adelgid]] form galls at the base of twigs which resemble miniature pineapples and those of the [[Gall adelgid|Cooley's spruce gall adelgid]] cause cone-shaped galls at the tips of branches. The larva of the [[spruce budworm]] eat the buds and growing shoots while the [[spruce needle miner]] hollows out the needles and makes them coalesce in a webbed mass. An elongated white [[scale insect]], the [[Chionaspis pinifoliae|pine needle scale]] feeds on the needles causing fluffy white patches on the twigs and aphids also suck sap from the needles and may cause them to fall and possibly dieback. Mites can also infest the blue spruce, especially in a dry summer, causing yellowing of the oldest needles.<ref name=IFAS>{{cite web |url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/st453 |title=''Picea pungens'': Colorado Spruce |author1=Gilman, Edward F. |author2=Watson, Dennis G. |date=2011-05-01 |work=EDIS |publisher=IFAS Extension Service: University of Florida |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/insect/05514.html |title=Scale Insects Affecting Conifers |author=Cranshaw, W.

Various rust diseases also affect the tree causing yellowing of the needles as well as needle fall. [[Canker]] caused by ''[[Cytospora]]'' attacks one of the lower branches first and progressively makes its way higher up the tree. The first symptom is the needles turning reddish-brown and falling off. Meanwhile, patches of white [[resin]] appear on the bark and the branch eventually dies.<ref name=IFAS/>\n\n===Cultivars===\n[[File:Picea pungens 'Glauca globosa' in Autumn.JPG|thumb|Foliage of the cultivar 'Glauca globosa']]\n\nCommon cultivars (those marked {{smallcaps|agm}} have gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]]):- \n*'Glauca Globosa'{{smallcaps|agm}}<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Picea pungens'' 'Globosa'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1465|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref> - shrub from {{convert|3|-|5|ft|m}} in height<ref>[http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/c825/picea-pungens-glauca-globosa.aspx Missouri Botanical Garden: ''Picea pungens'' 'Glauca Globosa']</ref> \n*'Fat Albert' - compact perfect cone to {{convert|10|ft|m}} of a silver blue color<ref>[http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/e660/picea-pungens-fat-albert.aspx Missouri Botanical Garden: ''Picea pungens'' Fat Albert]</ref>\n*'Glauca Jean's Dilly' - shrub from {{convert|3|-|6|ft|m}} in height<ref>[http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/a421/picea-glauca-jean's-dilly.aspx Missouri Botanical Garden: ''Picea pungens'' 'Glauca Jean's Dilly']</ref>\n*'Glauca Pendula' - drooping branches, spreads to about {{convert|8|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|4|ft|m}} tall<ref>[http://www.finegardening.com/plantguide/picea-pungens-glauca-pendula-colorado-blue-spruce.aspx Fine Gardening Plant Guide: Picea pungens \u2018Glauca Pendula']</ref>\n*'Hoopsii' {{smallcaps|agm}}<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Picea pungens'' 'Hoopsii'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1466|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>\n*'Koster'<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector - ''Picea pungens'' 'Koster'|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=1467|accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>\n*'Baby Blue Eyes'<ref>{{cite web|title=Missouri Botanical Garden - ''Picea pungens 'Baby Blueeyes'| url=http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/plant-finder/plant-details/kc/d137/picea-pungens-baby-blueeyes.aspx}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Washington State University - ''Picea pungens 'Baby Blueeyes'| url=http://www.pnwplants.wsu.edu/PlantDisplay.aspx?PlantID=243}}</ref>\n*'Baby Blue' <ref>{{cite web|title=West Montrose Farms Ltd - ''Picea pungens 'Baby Blue'| url=http://www.babybluespruce.com/}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nThe [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Keresan languages|Keres]] Native Americans used this tree as a traditional [[medicinal plant]] and a ceremonial item, and twigs are given as gifts to bring good fortune.

The [[leaf|leaves]] are {{convert|15|-|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long, pinnate, with 7\u201311 leaflets, each leaflet lanceolate, {{convert|7|-|13|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long, with the apical leaflets the largest but only slightly so. The [[flower]]s are small wind-pollinated [[catkin]]s, produced in spring. The [[fruit]] is a very bitter [[nut (fruit)|nut]], {{convert|2|-|3|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long with a green four-valved cover which splits off at maturity in the fall, and a hard, bony shell. Another identifying characteristic is its bright sulfur-yellow winter buds. No other hickory has this distinguishing feature.\n\nIt is closely related to the [[pecan]], sharing similar leaf shape and being classified in the same section of the genus ''Carya'' sect. ''Apocarya'', but unlike the pecan, it does not have edible nuts. It is most readily distinguished from the pecan by the smaller number of leaflets, with many leaves having only 7 leaflets (rarely fewer than 9, and often 11\u201313, in the pecan). [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrids]] with the pecan are known, and named ''Carya'' \u00d7 ''brownii''. A hybrid between the shagbark hickory (''C. ovata'') is also recognized, and is known as Laney's hickory (''Carya'' \u00d7''laneyi'').<ref>http://www.freefictionbooks.org/books/n/18194-northern-nut-growers-association-report-of-the-pro?start=97</ref>\n[[File:Carya cordiformis NRCS-1.jpg|thumb|right|Bitternut leaf]]\n\n== Habitat ==\n[[File:Carya cordiformis leaves.jpg|thumb|left|Branch of a bitternut hickory with developing nuts]]\nBitternut hickory grows in moist mountain valleys along streambanks and in swamps. Although it is usually found on wet bottom lands, it grows on dry sites and also grows well on poor soils low in nutrients. The species is not included as a titled species in the Society of American Foresters forest cover types because it does not grow in sufficient numbers.\n\n== Range ==\n[[File:Bitternutrangemap.jpg|thumb|left|US range map of ''Carya cordiformis'']]\n\nBitternut hickory grows throughout the eastern United States from southwestern New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, and southern Quebec; west to southern Ontario, central Michigan, and northern Minnesota; south to eastern Texas; and east to northwestern Florida and Georgia. It is most common, however, from southern New England west to Iowa and from southern Michigan south to Kentucky. It is probably the most abundant and most uniformly distributed of all the hickories.\n\n== Uses ==\nBitternut is used for lumber and pulpwood. Because bitternut hickory wood is hard and durable, it is used for furniture, paneling, dowels, tool handles and ladders. Like other hickories, the [[wood]] is used for [[smoking (food)|smoking]] [[meat]], and by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for making [[bow (weapon)|bows]].

Other common names are '''pignut''', '''sweet pignut''', '''coast pignut hickory''', '''smoothbark hickory''', '''swamp hickory''', and '''broom hickory'''. The pear-shaped [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] ripens in September and October and is an important part of the diet of many wild animals. The [[wood]] is used for a variety of products, including fuel for home heating.\n\n==Habitat==\n\n===Native range===\nThe range of pignut hickory covers nearly all of eastern United States (11). The species grows in central [[Florida]] and westward through Louisiana and along the [[Gulf Coast]] to [[Alabama]] through [[Mississippi]]. It extends through parts of East [[Texas]] to [[Louisiana]], [[Arkansas]], [[Missouri]] and extreme southeastern [[Iowa]]. Its range further includes [[Massachusetts]] and the southwest corner of [[New Hampshire]] westward through southern [[Vermont]] to central [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan]] and [[Illinois]].\n\nThe best development of this species is in the lower [[Ohio River]] Basin. It prevails over other species of hickory in the [[Appalachia]]n forests. Pignut makes up much of the hickory harvested in [[Kentucky]], [[West Virginia]], the [[Cumberland Mountains]] of [[Tennessee]], and the hill country of the [[Ohio Valley]].\n\nPignut hickory is also found in Canada in southern [[Ontario]]. It does however have a limited range and is restricted to the [[Niagara Peninsula]], southern [[Halton Region]], the [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]\narea along western [[Lake Ontario]], and southward along the northern shore of [[Lake Erie]] and pockets of extreme southwestern Ontario.\n\n===Climate===\nPignut hickory grows in a [[humid]] [[climate]] with an average annual [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] of 760 to 2,030&nbsp;mm (30 to 80 in) of which 510 to 1,020&nbsp;mm (20 to 40 in) is [[rain]] during the growing season. Average [[snowfall]] varies from little to none in the South to 2,540&nbsp;mm (100&nbsp;in) or more in the mountains of [[West Virginia]], southeastern [[New York (state)|New York]], and southern [[Vermont]] (25).\n\nWithin the range of pignut hickory, [[average annual temperature]]s vary from 7&nbsp;\u00b0C (45&nbsp;\u00b0F) in the north to 21&nbsp;\u00b0C (70&nbsp;\u00b0F) in Florida. Average January temperature varies from -4\u00b0 to 16&nbsp;\u00b0C (25\u00b0 to 60&nbsp;\u00b0F) and average July temperature varies from 21\u00b0 to 27&nbsp;\u00b0C (70\u00b0 to 80&nbsp;\u00b0F). Extremes of 46\u00b0 and -30&nbsp;\u00b0C (115\u00b0 and -22&nbsp;\u00b0F) have been recorded within the range. The [[growing season]] varies by [[latitude]] and [[elevation]] from 140 to 300 days.\n\nMean annual [[relative humidity]] ranges from 70 to 80 percent with small monthly differences; daytime relative humidity often falls below 50% while nighttime humidity approaches 100%.\n\nMean annual [[Insolation|hours of sunshine]] range from 2,200 to 3,000. Average January sunshine varies from 100 to 200 hours, and July sunshine from 260 to 340 hours. Mean daily solar radiation ranges from 12.57 to 18.86 million J m\u00b1 (300 to 450 [[langley (unit)|langley]]s). In January daily radiation varies from 6.28 to 12.57 million J m\u00b1 (150 to 300 langleys), and in July from 20.95 to 23.04 million J m\u00b1 (500 to 550 langleys).\n\nAccording to one classification of climate (20), the range of pignut hickory south of the [[Ohio River]], except for a small area in Florida, is designated as humid, [[mesothermal]]. That part of the range lying north of the Ohio River is designated humid, mesothermal. Part of the species range in peninsular Florida is classed as subhumid, mesothermal. [[Mountain]]s in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee are classed as wet, [[microthermal]], and mountains in South Carolina and Georgia are classed as wet, mesothermal. Throughout its range, precipitation is rated adequate during all seasons.\n\n===Soils and topography===\nPignut hickory frequently grows on dry ridgetops and sideslopes throughout its range but it is also common on moist sites, particularly in the mountains and [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]]. In the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] pignut hickory has been observed on dry sandy soils at low elevations. Whittaker (27) placed pignut in a [[submesic]] class and charted it as ranging up to 1480 m (4,850&nbsp;ft)-the hickory with the greatest elevational range in the Great Smoky Mountains. In southwest Virginia, south-facing upper slopes from 975 to 1050 m (3,200 to 3,445&nbsp;ft) of [[Beanfield Mountain]] are dominated by pignut hickory, northern red oak ''[[Quercus rubra]]''), and white oak (''[[Quercus alba|Q. alba]]''). This site is the most xeric [[habitat]] on the mountain because of high [[insolation]], 70 percent slopes, and medium- to coarse-textured soils derived from [[Clinch sandstone]]. Mid-elevation slopes from 800 to 975 m (2,625 to 3,200&nbsp;ft) are dominated by chestnut oak (''[[Quercus prinus|Q. prinus]]''), northern red oak, and pignut hickory and coincide with three [[shale]] formations (12).\n\nThe range of pignut hickory encompasses 7 [[USDA soil taxonomy|orders]], 12 suborders, and 22 great groups of [[soil]]s (24,25). About two-thirds of the species range is dominated by [[Ultisols]], which are low in bases and have subsurface horizons of [[clay]] accumulation. They are usually moist but are dry during part of the warm season. [[Udults]] is the dominant suborder and [[Hapludults]] and [[Paleudults]] are the dominant great groups. These soils are derived from a variety of parent materials-[[sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rocks|metamorphic]] rocks, [[glacial till]], and in places varying thickness of [[loess]]-which vary in age from [[Precambrian]] to [[Quaternary]].\n\nA wide range of soil fertility exists as evidenced by soil orders-[[Alfisols]] and [[Mollisols]] which are medium to high in base saturation to Ultisols which are low in base saturation (24). Pignut hickory responds to increases in soil nitrogen similarly to American beech (''[[Fagus grandifolia]]''), sugar maple (''[[Acer saccharum]]''), and blackgum (''[[Nyssa sylvatica]]'') (15). These species are rated as intermediate in nitrogen deficiency tolerance and consequently are able to grow with lower levels of nitrogen than are required by \"nitrogen- demanding\" white ash (''[[Fraxinus americana]]''), yellow-poplar (''[[Liriodendron tulipifera]]''), and American basswood (''[[Tilia americana]]''). Hickories are considered \"soil improvers\" because their [[Leaf|leaves]] have a relatively high [[calcium]] content.\n\n===Associated forest cover===\nHickories are consistently present in the broad eastern upland [[Climax vegetation|climax]] forest association commonly called oak-hickory, but they are not generally abundant (18). Locally, hickories may make up to 20 to 30 percent of stand basal area, particularly in slope and cove forests below the [[escarpment]] of the [[Cumberland Plateau]] (23) and in second-growth forests in the [[Cumberland Mountains]], especially on [[Bench (geology)|benches]] (14). It has been hypothesized that hickory will replace chestnut (''[[Castanea dentata]]'') killed by the blight (''[[Cryphonectria parasitica]]'') in the [[Appalachia]]n Highlands (10,12). On [[Beanfield Mountain]] in [[Giles County, Virginia|Giles County]], [[Virginia]], the former chestnut-oak complex has changed to an oak-hickory association over a period of 50 years. This association is dominated by pignut hickory with an importance value of 41.0 (maximum value = 300), northern red oak (36.0), and chestnut oak (25.0). White oak, red maple (Acer rubrum), and sugar maple are subdominant species.\n\nPignut hickory is an associated species in 20 of the 90 forest cover types listed by the [[Society of American Foresters]] for the eastern United States (6):\n\n===Northern forest region===\n\n53 [[Pinus strobus|White Pine]]-[[Quercus prinus|Chestnut Oak]]\n\n===Central forest region===\n\n40 [[Quercus stellata|Post Oak]]-[[Quercus marilandica|Blackjack Oak]] <br/>\n44 [[Quercus prinus|Chestnut Oak]] <br/>\n45 [[Pinus rigida|Pitch Pine]] <br/>\n46 [[Juniperus virginiana|Eastern Redcedar]] <br/>\n52 [[Quercus alba|White Oak]]-[[Quercus velutina|Black Oak]]-[[Quercus rubra|Northern Red Oak]] <br/>\n53 White Oak <br/>\n55 Northern Red Oak <br/>\n57 [[Liriodendron tulipifera|Yellow-Poplar]]-[[Liriodendron|Tulip tree]] <br/>\n59 Yellow-Poplar-White Oak-Northern Red Oak <br/>\n64 [[Sassafras]]-[[Persimmon]] <br/>\n110 Black Oak\n\n===Southern forest region===\n\n75 [[Pinus echinata|Shortleaf Pine]] <br/>\n76 Shortleaf Pine-[[Oak]] <br/>\n78 [[Pinus virginiana|Virginia Pine]]-Oak <br/>\n79 Virginia Pine <br/>\n80 [[Pinus taeda|Loblolly Pine]]-[[Pinus echinata|Shortleaf Pine]] <br/>\n81 Loblolly Pine <br/>\n82 Loblolly Pine-[[Hardwood]] <br/>\n83 Longleaf Pine-[[Pinus elliottii|Slash Pine]]\n\nBecause the range of pignut hickory is so extensive, it is not feasible to list the associated [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, [[Herbaceous|herb]]s, and [[grass]]es, which vary according to [[elevation]], topographic conditions, [[edaphic]] features, and geographic locality.\n\n==Life history==\n[[Image:Pignut-hickory-nut.jpg|thumb|right|Pignut hickory nuts]]\n\n===Reproduction and early growth===\n[[Flowering]] and [[fruit]]ing- Hickories are [[monoecious]] and flower in the spring (3). The [[Stamen|staminate]] [[catkins]] of pignut hickory are 8 to 18&nbsp;cm (3 to 7 in) long and develop from [[axil]]s of leaves of the previous season or from inner scales of the terminal [[bud]]s at the base of the current growth. The [[pistil]]late flowers appear in [[Spike (botany)|spike]]s about 6&nbsp;mm (0.25&nbsp;in) long on [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]s terminating in shoots of the current year. Flowers open from the middle of March in the southeast part of the range to early June in [[New England]]. The catkins usually emerge before the pistillate flowers.\n\nThe [[fruit]] of hickory is [[pear]] shaped and enclosed in a thin husk developed from the floral [[Involucral bract|involucre]]. The fruit ripens in September and October, and [[seed]]s are dispersed from September through December. Husks are green until maturity; they turn brown to brownish-black as they ripen. The husks become dry at maturity and [[Dehiscence (botany)|split away]] from the [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] into four valves along sutures. Husks of pignut hickory split only to the middle or slightly beyond and generally cling to the nut, which is unribbed, with a thick shell.\n\n===Seed production and dissemination===\nPignut hickory begins to bear [[seed]] in quantity in 30 years, with optimum production between 75 and 200 years (16). The maximum age for seed production is about 300 years. Good seed crops occur every year or two with light crops in other years; [[frost]] can seriously hinder seed production (22). Usually less than half of the seeds are sound (2,3), but 50 to 75 percent of these will germinate. The hickory shuckworm (''Laspeyresia caryana'') can seriously reduce [[germination]]. Pignut seed, averaging 440/kg (200/lb), is lighter than the seed of other hickory species. The nuts are disseminated mainly by gravity, but the range of seeding is extended by [[squirrel]]s and [[chipmunk]]s.\n\n===Seedling development===\nHickories exhibit embryo dormancy which is overcome naturally by overwintering in the [[Forest floor|duff]] and [[Plant litter|litter]] or artificially by [[stratification (botany)|stratification]] in a moist medium at 1\u00b0 to 4&nbsp;\u00b0C (33\u00b0 to 40&nbsp;\u00b0F) for 30 to 150 days. In forest tree [[Nursery (horticulture)|nurseries]] unstratified hickory nuts are sown in the fall and stratified nuts are sown in the spring. Hickories are [[hypogeal germination|hypogeously]] germinating plants, and the nuts seldom remain viable in the forest floor for more than one winter (22).\n\nSeedling growth of hickories is slow. The following height growth of pignut hickory seedlings was reported in the Ohio Valley in the open or under light shade, on red [[clay]] soil (2):\n\n{|\n|-\n! Age\n! colspan=\"2\" | Height\n|-\n| (yr) || (cm) || (in)\n|-\n| 1    || 8    || 3.0\n|-\n| 2    || 15   || 5.8\n|-\n| 3    || 20   || 8.0\n|-\n| 4    || 30   || 12.0\n|-\n| 5    || 43   || 17.0\n|}\n\n===Vegetative reproduction===\nHickories sprout readily from [[stump (tree)|stump]]s and [[root]]s. Stump sprouting is not as prolific as in other [[deciduous]] trees species but the sprouts that are produced are vigorous and grow fairly rapidly in height. Root sprouts also are vigorous and probably more numerous than stump sprouts in cut-over areas. Small stumps sprout more frequently than large ones. Sprouts that originate at or below ground level and from small stumps are less likely to develop [[heartwood]] decay. Pignut hickory is difficult to reproduce from [[cutting (plant)|cutting]]s.\n\n===Sapling and pole stages to maturity===\nGrowth and yield- Pignut hickory often grows 24 to 27 m (80 to 90&nbsp;ft) tall and occasionally reaches 37&nbsp;m (120&nbsp;ft), with [[d.b.h.]] of 91 to 122&nbsp;cm (36 to 48 in). The [[bole (botany)|bole]] is often forked. Height and diameter by age are shown in table 1 for selected locations. Diameter growth of pignut hickory (along with [[chestnut oak]], [[white oak]], sweet birch (''[[Betula lenta]]''), and [[American beech]] is rated slow. Since hickories constitute 15 percent or less of the basal area of [[oak]]-hickory forest types, most growth and yield information is written in terms of oak rather than oak-hickory. Yields of mixed oak stands (5,7,19) and of hickory stands (2) have been reported. Tree volume tables are available (2,19).\n\n{|\n|+ Diameter and height of pignut hickory in selected geographic areas (adapted from 2)\n|-\n!Age\n![[D.b.h.]]\n! colspan=\"4\" | Height\n|-\n!\n!S.

The taproot develops early, which may explain the slow growth of seedling shoots. Taproots may develop in compact and stony soils.\n\n===Reaction to competition===\nThe hickories as a group are classed as intermediate in shade tolerance; however, pignut hickory has been classed as intolerant in the Northeast and tolerant in the Southeast. In much of the area covered by mixed oak forests, shade-tolerant [[hardwood]]s (including the hickories) are [[Climax vegetation|climax]], and the trend of [[Ecological succession|succession]] toward this climax is very strong. Although most silvicultural systems when applied to oak types will maintain a hardwood forest, the cutting methods used affects the rapidity with which other species may replace the oaks and hickories (17,18,26).\n\n==Damaging agents==\nPignut hickory is easily damaged by [[Wildfire|fire]], which causes stem degrade or loss of volume, or both. Internal discolorations called mineral streak are common and are one major reason why so few standing hickories meet trade specifications. Streaks result from [[yellow-bellied sapsucker]] pecking, pin [[Wood knot|knot]]s, worm holes, and mechanical injuries. Hickories strongly resist ice damage and seldom develop epicormic branches.\n\nThe Index of Plant Diseases in the United States lists 133 [[fungi]] and 10 other causes of diseases on Carya species (4,9). Most of the fungi are [[saprophyte]]s, but a few are damaging to foliage, produce [[canker]]s, or cause [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] or [[root]] [[Dry rot|rot]]s.\n\nThe most common disease of pignut hickory from Pennsylvania southward is a trunk rot caused by ''Poria spiculosa''. Cankers vary in size and appearance depending on their age. A common form develops around a branch wound and resembles a swollen, nearly healed wound. On large trees these may become prominent [[burl]]-like bodies having several vertical or irregular folds in the callus covering. A single trunk canker near the base is a sign that the butt log is badly infected, and multiple cankers are evidence that the entire tree may be a cull.\n\nMajor leaf diseases are [[anthracnose]] (''Gnomonia caryae'') and [[mildew]] (''Microstroma juglandis''). The former causes brown spots with definite margins on the undersides of the leaf. These may coalesce and cause widespread blotching. Mildew invades the leaves and twigs and may form witches' brooms by stimulating bud formation. Although locally prevalent, mildew offers no problem in the management of hickory.\n\nThe stem [[canker]] (''Nectria galligena'') produces depressed areas with concentric [[bark]] rings that develop on the trunk and branches. Affected trees are sometimes eliminated through breakage or competition and sometimes live to reach merchantable size with cull section at the canker. No special control measures are required, but cankered trees should be harvested in stand improvement operations.\n\nA gall-forming fungus species of ''Phomopsis'' can produce warty excrescences ranging from small twig [[gall]]s to very large trunk [[burl]]s on northern hickories and oaks. Little information is available on root diseases of hickory.\n\nMore than 100 [[insect]]s have been reported to infest hickory trees and [[wood]] products, but only a few cause death or severe damage (1). The hickory [[bark beetle]] (''Scolytus quadrispinosus'') is the most important insect enemy of hickory, and also one of the most important insect pests of hardwoods in the Eastern United States. During [[drought]] periods in the Southeast, outbreaks often develop and large tracts of timber are killed. At other times, damage may be confined to the killing of a single tree or to portions of the tops of trees. The foliage of heavily infested trees turns red within a few weeks after attack, and the trees soon die. There is one generation per year in northern areas and normally two broods per year in the South. Control consists of felling infested trees and destroying the bark during winter months or storing infested logs in ponds.\n\nLogs and dying trees of several hardwood species including pignut hickory are attacked by the [[ambrosia beetle]] (''Platypus quadridentatus'') throughout the South and north to West Virginia and North Carolina. The [[Bostrichidae|false powderpost beetle]] (''Xylobiops basilaris'') attacks recently felled or dying trees, logs, or limbs with bark in the Eastern and Southern States. Hickory, persimmon (''[[Diospyros virginiana]]''), and pecan (''[[Carya illinoinensis|C. illinoinensis]]'') are most frequently infested, but other hardwoods also are attacked. Healthy trees growing in proximity to heavily infested trees are occasionally attacked but almost always without success. Hickory and persimmon wood (useful in the manufacture of small products such as [[shuttle block]]s, [[mallet]]s, and [[Splitting maul|mauls]] is sometimes seriously damaged.\n\nHickory is one of several host species of the [[Longhorn beetle|twig girdler]] (''Oncideres cingulata''). Infested trees and seedlings are not only damaged severely but become ragged and unattractive. A few of the more common species of gall-producing insects attacking hickory are ''[[Phylloxera]] caryaecaulis'', ''[[Caryomyia]] holotricha'', ''C. sanguinolenta'', and ''C. tubicola''.\n\n==Special uses==\nHickories provide food to many kinds of wildlife (8,13). The nuts are relished by several species of [[squirrel]] and represent an estimated 10 to 25 percent of their diet. Nuts and flowers are eaten by the [[wild turkey]] and several species of [[songbird]]s. Nuts and bark are eaten by [[American black bear|black bear]]s, [[fox]]es, [[rabbit]]s, and [[raccoon]]s. Small [[mammal]]s eat the nuts and leaves; 5 to 10 percent of the diet of eastern [[chipmunk]]s is hickory nuts. [[White-tailed deer]] occasionally browse hickory leaves, [[twig]]s, and nuts.\n\nThe kernel of hickory seeds is exceptionally high in crude [[fat]], up to 70 to 80 percent in some species. Crude [[protein]], [[phosphorus]], and [[calcium]] contents are generally moderate to low. Crude [[Dietary fiber|fiber]] is very low.\n\nPignut hickory makes up a small percentage of the [[biomass]] in low-quality upland hardwood stands that are prime candidates for [[clearcutting]] for chips or fuelwood as the first step toward rehabilitation to more productive stands. Hickory has a relatively high heating value and is used extensively as a home heating fuel.\n\nPignut hickory is an important [[shade tree]] in wooded [[suburban]] areas over most of the range but is seldom planted as an [[ornamental tree]] because of its size and difficulty of transplanting, although it has spectacular orangey-red fall colors.\n\n==Genetics==\n''Carya glabra'' var. ''megacarpa'' (Sarg.) Sarg., coast pignut hickory, was once recognized as a distinct variety but is now considered to be a synonym of ''C. glabra'' (Mill.) Sweet. ''C. leiodermis'' Sarg., swamp hickory, has also been added as a synonym of ''C. glabra'' (11).\n\n''Carya glabra'' (Mill.) Sweet var. ''glabra'' distinguishes the (typical) pignut hickory from red hickory (''C. glabra'' var. ''odorata'' (Marsh.) Little). The [[taxonomic]] position of red hickory is controversial. The binomial ''C. ovalis'' (Wangenh.) Sarg. was published in 1913 for a segregate of ''C. glabra''. It was reduced to a [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of ''C. glabra'' in Little's 1953 checklist but was elevated to a [[Variety (botany)|variety]] in the 1979 edition (11). The principal difference is in the husk of the [[fruit]], opening late and only partly, or remaining closed in ''C. glabra'' but promptly [[Dehiscence (botany)|splitting]] to the base in C. ovalis. However, many trees are intermediate in this trait, and the recorded ranges are almost the same. The leaves of ''C. ovalis'' have mostly seven leaflets; those of ''C. glabra'' have mostly five leaflets. The two can be distinguished with certainty only in November. Since the two ranges seem to overlap, the distributions have been mapped together as a Carya glabra-ovalis complex (11).\n\n''Carya ovalis'' has also been treated as an interspecific hybrid between ''C. glabra'' and ''C. ovata''. ''C. ovalis'' was accepted as a polymorphic species especially variable in the size and shape of its nuts and possibly a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]. The relationships may be more complex after a long and reticulate [[phylogeny]], according to detailed [[chemical]] analyses of hickory nut oils.\n\nOne hybrid, ''C.'' x ''demareei'' Palmer (''C. glabra'' x ''cordiformis'') was described in 1937 from northeastern [[Arkansas]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Carya glabra}}\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n#Baker, Whiteford L. 1972.

It is a slow-growing, long-lived tree, hard to transplant because of its long taproot, and subject to insect damage. The nuts, largest of all hickory nuts, are sweet and edible. Wildlife and people harvest most of them; those remaining produce seedling trees readily. The wood is hard, heavy, strong, and very flexible, making it a favored wood for tool handles. A specimen tree has been reported in Missouri with {{convert|117|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} [[diameter at breast height]], {{convert|36.9|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, and a spread of {{convert|22.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Habitat ==\n=== Native range ===\nShellbark hickory is widely distributed, but is nowhere common. The range extends from western New York through southern Michigan to southeast Iowa, south through eastern Kansas into northern Oklahoma, and eastward through Tennessee into Pennsylvania. This species is most prominent in the lower Ohio River region and south along the Mississippi River to central Arkansas. It is frequently found in the great river swamps of central Missouri and the Wabash River region in Indiana and Ohio.\n\nIn part due to man's activities, shellbark hickory has become rare in its natural range. The heavy seeds do not travel far from the parent tree and many stands have been lost to forest clearing and lumber harvesting. It is also not planted much as an ornamental due to its slow growth and difficulty of transplanting.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe mean length of the frost-free period within the range of shellbark hickory is from 150 to 210 days. The average January temperature is between {{convert|-4|and|5|C|F}}, and for July the mean temperature is from {{convert|23|to|27|C|F}}. An average minimum temperature of {{convert|-26|C|F}} occurs in the northern part of the range, and an average maximum temperature of {{convert|38|C|F}} is found throughout the range. Precipitation varies between {{convert|750|and|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year including {{convert|15|to|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} of snow.\n\n=== Soils and topography ===\nShellbark hickory grows best on deep, fertile, moist soils, most typical of the order Alfisols. It does not thrive in heavy clay soils, but grows well on heavy loams or silt loams. Shellbark hickory requires moister situations than do pignut, mockernut, or shagbark hickories (''Carya glabra, C. alba,'' or ''C. ovata''), although it is sometimes found on dry, sandy soils. Specific nutrient requirements are not known, but generally the hickories grow best on neutral or slightly alkaline soils.\n\nThe species is essentially a bottomland species and is often found on river terraces and second bottoms. Land subject to shallow inundations for a few weeks early in the growing season is favorable for shellbark. However, the tree will grow on a wide range of topographic and physiographic sites.\n\n=== Associated forest cover ===\nShellbark hickory may be found in pure groups of several trees but is more frequent singly in association with other hardwoods. The species is a minor component of the forest cover types bur oak (Society of American Foresters type 42), [[pin oak\u2013sweetgum]] (type 65), and [[swamp chestnut oak\u2013cherrybark oak]] (type 91). It may also be found in one or more of the types in which hickories are included, but it is not identified at the species level.\n\nShellbark hickory commonly grows in association with [[American elm|American]] (''Ulmus americana''), [[slippery elm|slippery]] (''U. rubra''), and [[winged elm]]s (''U. alata''), [[white ash|white]] (''Fraxinus americana'') and [[green ash]] (''F. pennsylvanica''), [[American basswood|basswood]] (''Tilia americana''), [[American hornbeam]] (''Carpinus caroliniana''), [[red maple]] (''Acer rubrum''), [[blackgum]] (''Nyssa sylvatica''), [[American sweetgum|sweetgum]] (''Liquidambar styraciflua''), and [[Eastern cottonwood|cottonwood]] (''Populus deltoides''). It is found in association with four other hickories\u2013[[shagbark hickory|shagbark]], [[mockernut hickory|mockernut]], [[bitternut hickory|bitternut]] (''Carya cordiformis''), and [[water hickory|water]] (''C. aquatica''), and numerous oak species, including [[swamp white oak|swamp white]] (''Quercus bicolor''), [[pin oak|pin]] (''Q. palustris''), [[Quercus alba|white]] (''Q. alba''), [[Shumard oak|Shumard]] (''Q. shumardii''), [[water oak|water]] (''Q. nigra''), [[Delta post oak|Delta post]] (''Q. stellata'' var. ''paludosa''), [[swamp chestnut oak|swamp chestnut]] (''Q. michauxii''), and [[Nuttall oak|Nuttall]] (''Q. nuttallii'').\n\nThe herbaceous stratum includes numerous sedges and grasses. The shrub and small [[tree layer]] may be composed of [[painted buckeye]] (''Aesculus sylvatica''), [[common pawpaw|pawpaw]] (''Asimina triloba''), [[flowering dogwood]] (''Cornus florida''), [[eastern redbud]] (''Cercis canadensis''), [[possumhaw]] (''Ilex decidua''), [[poison ivy]] (''Toxicodendron radicans''), and [[trumpet-creeper]] (''Campsis radicans'').\n\n== Life history ==\n=== Sapling and pole stages to maturity ===\nGrowth and yield: The hickories as a group grow slowly in diameter, and shellbark hickory is no exception. Sapling size trees average {{convert|2|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} per year in diameter growth, increasing to {{convert|3|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} per year as poles and sawtimber. Second-growth trees show growth rates of {{convert|5|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} per year. Shellbark hickory occasionally grows to a height of {{convert|40|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} and a diameter of {{convert|100|cm|in|0}}.\n\nRooting habit: Shellbark hickory develops a large taproot that penetrates deeply into the soil. Lateral roots emerge at nearly right angles to the taproot, spreading horizontally through the soil. Major distinct lateral roots usually develop 12 inches or more below ground level and appear only after taproot is well formed. In Illinois, root growth was rapid in April, slowed during July and August, increased again in September, and ended in late November.\n\nMycorrhizal associations are formed when trees are young. The only specific fungus identified from shellbark hickory roots is an ectotrophic mycorrhiza,'' [[Laccaria ochropurpurea]]''.\n\nReaction to competition: Shellbark hickory is very shade-tolerant, exceeded only by [[sugar maple]] (''Acer saccharum'') and [[American beech|beech]] (''Fagus grandifolia''). It grows slowly under a dense canopy, however. In stands with only partial shade, it reproduces well. It is a very strong competitor in most of the species associations in which it is found.\n\nUnder forest conditions, shellbark hickory often develops a clear bole for half its length and has a narrow, oblong crown.

Washington, DC.</ref>  Heavy release sometimes results in epicormic branching.\n\nDamaging agents: Although numerous insects and diseases affect hickories, shellbark hickory has no enemies that seriously threaten its development or perpetuation as a species. Seed production can be reduced significantly, however, through attack by several insects. Two of the most important are the pecan weevil (''Curculio caryae'') and the hickory shuckworm (''[[Laspeyresia caryana]]'').\n\nThe hickory bark beetle (''[[Scolytus quadrispinosus]]'') feeds in the cambium and seriously weakens or even kills some trees. Adults of the hickory spiral borer (''[[Agrilus arcuatus]] torquatus'') feed on leaves, but the larvae feed beneath the bark and can be very destructive to hickory seedlings. The flatheaded appletree borer (''[[Chrysobothris femorata]]'') likewise is a foliage-feeder as an adult, but its larvae feed on the phloem and outer sapwood.\n\nThe living-hickory borer (''[[Goes pulcher]]'') feeds in the trunks and branches of trees. A twig girdler (''[[Oncideres cingulata]]'') can seriously affect reproduction by killing back the tops of seedlings and sprouts. Both standing dead trees and freshly cut logs are highly susceptible to attacks by numerous species of wood borers.\n\nA large number of insect species feed on hickory foliage. None of them causes serious problems for shellbark hickory, although they may be responsible for some stem deformity and growth loss.<ref>Baker, Whiteford L. 1976. Eastern forest insects. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Miscellaneous Publication 1175. Washington, DC. 642 p.</ref>\n\nShellbark hickory is free of serious diseases, but it is a host species for a variety of fungi. More than 130 fungi have been identified from species of ''Carya''. These include leaf disease, stem canker, wood rot, and root rot-causing fungi. Specific information for shellbark hickory is not available.<ref>Hepting, George H. 1971. Diseases of forest and shade trees of the United States. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Handbook 386. Washington, DC. 658 p.</ref>\n\nShellbark hickory is susceptible to bole injury from fire, and fire injuries are often invaded by wood rot fungi. It is resistant to snow and ice damage, but is susceptible to frost damage.\n\n== Special uses ==\nShellbark hickory nuts are used for food by ducks, quail, wild turkeys, squirrels, chipmunks, deer, foxes, raccoons, and white-footed mice. A few plantations of shellbark hickory have been established for nut production, but the nuts are difficult to crack, though the kernel is sweet. The wood is used for furniture, tool handles, sporting goods, veneer, fuelwood, charcoal, and drum sticks.\n\n== Genetics ==\nShellbark hickory hybridizes with the [[pecan]], ''Carya illinoensis'' (''C.'' x ''nussbaumeri'' Sarg.), and shagbark hickory,'' C. ovata'' (''C.'' x'' dunbarii'' Sarg.). Shellbark hickory has 32 chromosomes. In general, species within the genus with the same chromosome number are able to cross. Numerous hybrids among the'' Carya'' species with 32 chromosomes (pecan, [[Carya cordiformis|bitternut]], shellbark, and [[Carya ovata|shagbark]]) have been described.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Bonner, F.

It is typically found growing in dry, well drained sandy upland ridges and sloped woodlands from southern [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], and in the [[United States]] east to [[New Hampshire]], south to northern [[Florida]] west to eastern [[Texas]] and north-west to [[Nebraska]].<ref>USDA Germplasm Resources Information Network: [http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/taxon.pl?402991 ''Carya ovalis'']</ref> This species was formerly treated as a variety or northern [[ecotype]] of the [[pignut hickory]] ''C. glabra'', described as ''Carya glabra'' var. ''odorata''. This discrepancy has not yet been completely resolved, and some sources and authors still consider red hickory as a variety or synonym of pignut hickory.<ref>Flora of North America: [http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=233500317 ''Carya glabra'']</ref> However both trees are quite morphologically distinct.\n\n== Description ==\nThe red hickory is generally encountered as a medium-sized [[tree]], capable of growing to {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in height.<ref>Plants For A Future: [http://www.pfaf.org/user/Plant.aspx?LatinName=Carya+ovalis ''Carya ovalis'']</ref> The single [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] is straight and often continues for the entire height of the tree, although sometimes splits into several large limbs once the canopy has been breached. The [[branch]]es are strong, stout and long, ascending in the upper [[Crown (botany)|crown]] and drooping in the lower crown; the branches around mid-height are more or less horizontal. This creates a broad, thick, column-shaped form that casts dense shade. Individuals have been known to live from 100\u2013250 years of age.\n\n[[File:RedHickoryNuts.jpg||thumb|left||the thin shelled nuts of red hickory]]\nThe [[leaves]] are pinnately [[Compound leaves|compound]], typically producing 5-9 [[leaflet (botany)|leaflets]] (7 being the most common). The [[terminal leaflet]] is often the largest, with the auxiliary leaflets decreasing in size from the tip to the base of the [[rachis]]. Leaflets are broadest above or at their [[median]] length, with finely [[Serrate (botany)|serrated]] margins. They are dark green and smooth or [[glaucous]] above and paler and finely [[Leaf#Surface|pubescent]] underneath. the rachis of the leaves are usually bright red or purple in color, a distinctive feature of red hickory that helps to separate it from pignut hickory.<ref name=Ohio>Ohio Trees Bulletin 700-00: [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090708064229/http://ohioline.osu.edu/b700/b700_23.html ''Carya'' \u2013 Hickory]</ref>\n\n[[File:RedHickoryBark.jpg||thumb|left||The bark of a mature red hickory]]The [[bark]] of mature trees is grey, composed of tight, flat-topped intersecting ridges that can appear quite blocky but are generally strap-like. Occasionally, the ridges may separate from the trunk in peeling strips, loose at both ends, a trait characteristic of [[Carya ovata|Shagbark]] and [[Carya laciniosa|Shellbark Hickories]]. Young, vigorously growing trees are more prone to producing peeling bark than mature individuals.\n\nLike all hickories, the fruit is a small round or slightly elliptical [[nut (fruit)|nut]], born singly or in groups of 2-3 on the ends of bearing branches. When immature, the nut is encased in a thin, green [[husk]] with 4 distinct seams. Upon maturity (late September to mid-October) the husk changes from being green, fleshy and flexible to dark brown and very brittle. The seams then split from the base upwards and may or may not completely separate from the ripe nut. The nut itself is smooth, tan to beige in color and has 4 shallow ridges from the seams. The inner [[seed|kernel]] is very oily and varies in flavor from bitter and unpalatable to mildly sweet. For such as small nut, the shell is thick and the kernel difficult to extract. These nuts are relished by countless wildlife species, including many [[rodents]] and [[birds]], as well as [[raccoon]]s and [[wild turkey]]s.\n\nThe [[flowers]] emerge in the spring at the same times as the developing leaves (early to late May). The male flowers are long, green, inconspicuous drooping [[catkin]]s that develop between the base of the petiole and the developing twig. The female flowers are bizarre looking, with a tuft of sticky green tissue emerging from a swollen base. These develop individually or in groups at the end of a new twig, after the expanding leaves. All hickories are self-infertile and [[monoecious]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Carya|ovalis]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Canada]]",

The tallest measured shagbark, located in Savage Gulf, Tennessee, is over {{convert|150|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} tall.  Mature shagbarks are easy to recognize because, as their name implies, they have shaggy bark.

They are unsuitable to commercial or orchard production due to the long time it takes for a tree to produce sizable crops and unpredictable output from year to year. Shagbark hickories can grow to enormous sizes but are unreliable bearers. The nuts can be used as a substitute for the [[pecan]] in colder climates and have nearly the same culinary function.\n\n''C. ovata'' begins producing seeds at about 10 years of age, but large quantities are not produced until 40 years and will continue for at least 100. Nut production is erratic, with good crops every 3 to 5 years, in between which few or none appear and the entire crop may be lost to animal predation.\n\n[[Andrew Jackson]], the seventh president of the United States, was popularly nicknamed Old Hickory, a play on the toughness of hickory wood. In 1830, he began planning the construction of his tomb at [[The Hermitage (Nashville, Tennessee)|The Hermitage]], his plantation in [[Tennessee]]. The grave site was surrounded by a variety of trees, including six shagbark hickories. They stood there for 168 years until a storm in 1998 demolished over 1,200 trees at the site. Work on replanting them remains an ongoing project. In modern times, shagbark hickory is rarely used as an ornamental due to its large size, slow growth, difficulty of transplanting (all Juglandacaea species have large taproots) and nut litter.\n\n\"Hickory\" is derived from ''pawcohiccora'', an Algonquian Indian word for the tree's oily nutmeat.\n<ref name=Hilton />  The nuts were a food source for Native Americans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/carya/species/ovata/ovata.htm |last=Grauke |first=LJ |publisher=Texas A&M University, Department of Horticultural Science |title=Hickories: ''Carya ovata''|accessdate=2013-08-10}}</ref>\n\nShagbark hickory [[wood]] is used for [[smoking (food)|smoking]] [[meat]] and for making the [[bow (weapon)|bows]] of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] of the northern area.

However, most of the merchantable mockernut grows on moderately fertile upland soils.<ref name=\"Nelson 1965\" />\n\nMockernut hickory grows primarily on [[Ultisol]]s occurring on an estimated 65 percent of its range, including much of the southern to northeastern United States.<ref name=\"USDA 1975\">U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service 1975.

Washington, DC 754 p.</ref> These soils are low in nutrients and usually moist, but during the warm season, they are dry part of the time. Along the mid-Atlantic and in the southern and western range, mockernut hickory grows on a variety of soils on slopes of 25 percent or less, including combinations of fine to coarse [[loam]]s, clays, and well-drained quartz sands. On slopes steeper than 25 percent, mockernut often grows on coarse loams.\n\nMockernut grows on [[Inceptisol]]s in an estimated 15 percent of its range. These clayey soils are moderate to high in nutrients and are primarily in the Appalachians on gentle to moderate slopes where water is available to plants during the growing season. In the northern Appalachians on slopes of 25 percent or less, mockernut hickory grows on poorly drained loams with a [[fragipan]]. In the central and southern Appalachians on slopes 25 percent or less, mockernut hickory grows on fine loams. On steeper slopes it grows on coarse loams.<ref name=\"USDA 1975\" />\n\nIn the northwestern part of the range, mockernut grows on [[mollisol]]s. These soils have a deep, fertile surface horizon greater than {{convert|25|cm|in}} thick. Mollisols characteristically form under grass in climates with moderate to high seasonal precipitation.\n\nMockernut grows on a variety of soils including wet, fine loams, sandy textured soils that often have been burned, plowed, and pastured. [[Alfisol]]s are also present in these areas and contain a medium to high supply of nutrients. Water is available to plants more than half the year or more than 3 consecutive months during the growing season. On slopes 25 percent or less, mockernut grows on wet to moist, fine loam soils with a high carbonate content.<ref name=\"USDA 1975\" />\n\n==Associated forest cover==\nMockernut hickory is associated with the eastern [[Oak-hickory forest]] and the [[beech-maple forest]]. The species does not exist in sufficient amounts to be included as a title species in the [[Society of American Foresters]] forest cover types. Nevertheless, it is identified as an associated species in eight cover types. Three of the upland oak types and the bottom land type are subclimax to [[climax vegetation|climax]]. The types are:\n\nCentral Forest Region (upland oaks)-Post Oak-Blackjack Oak (Type 40), White Oak-Black Oak-Northern Red Oak (Type 52), White Oak (Type 53), Black Oak (Type 110).\n\nSouthern Forest Region (southern yellow pines) Shortleaf Pine (Type 75), Loblolly Pine-Shortleaf Pine (Type 80); (oak-pine type) Loblolly Pine-Hardwood (Type 82); (bottom-land type) Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak (Type 91).\n\n===In the central forest upland oak types, mockernut is commonly associated with===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[pignut hickory]] (''Carya glabra'')\n* [[shagbark hickory]] (''C. ovata'')\n* [[bitternut hickory]] (''C. cordiformis'')\n* [[Quercus velutina|black oak]] (''Quercus velutina'')\n* [[scarlet oak]] (''Q. coccinea'')\n* [[post oak]] (''Q. stellata'')\n* [[bur oak]] (''Q. macrocarpa'')\n* [[blackgum]] (''Nyssa sylvatica'')\n* [[yellow-poplar]] (''Liriodendron tulipifera'')\n* [[maple]]s (''Acer'' spp.)\n* [[white ash]] (''Fraxinus americana'')\n* [[eastern white pine]] (''Pinus strobus'')\n* [[eastern hemlock]] (''Tsuga canadensis'')\n{{Div col end}}\n\n====Common understory vegetation includes====\n{{Div col}}\n* [[flowering dogwood]] (''Cornus Florida'')\n* [[sumac]] (''Rhus'' spp.)\n* sassafras (''[[Sassafras albidum]]'')\n* [[sourwood]] (''Oxydendrum arboreum'')\n* [[Amelanchier arborea|downy serviceberry]] (''Amelanchier'' spp.)\n* [[redbud]] (''Cercis canadensis'')\n* eastern hophornbeam (''[[Ostrya virginiana]]'')\n* [[American hornbeam]] (''Carpinus caroliniana'')\n{{Div col end}}\n\n====Mockernut is also associated with====\n{{Div col}}\n* wild grapes (''[[Vitis]]'' spp.)\n* rosebay rhododendron (''[[Rhododendron maximum]]'')\n* mountain-laurel (''[[Kalmia latifolia]]'')\n* [[Smilax|greenbriers]] (''Smilax'' spp.)\n* [[blueberry|blueberries]] (''Vaccinium'' spp.)\n* witch-hazel (''[[Hamamelis virginiana]]'')\n* spicebush (''[[Lindera benzoin]]'')\n* New Jersey tea (''[[Ceanothus]] americanus'')\n* wild hydrangea (''[[Hydrangea arborescens]]'')\n* [[tick-trefoil]] (''Desmodium'' spp.)\n* bluestem (''[[Andropogon]]'' spp.)\n* poverty oatgrass (''[[Danthonia spicata]]'')\n* [[Carex|sedge]]s (''Carex'' spp.)\n* pussytoes (''[[Antennaria]]'' spp.)\n* [[goldenrod]] (''Solidago'' spp.)\n* asters (''[[Aster (genus)|Aster]]'' or other genera, depending on the classification).\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===In the southern forest, mockernut grows with===\n{{Div col}}\n* shortleaf pine\n* loblolly pine\n* pignut hickory\n* gums\n* oaks\n* sourwood\n* [[winged elm]] (''Ulmus alata'')\n* flowering dogwood\n* redbud\n* sourwood\n* [[persimmon]] (''Diospyros uirginiana'')\n* eastern redcedar (''[[Juniperus virginiana]]'')\n* sumacs\n* [[Crataegus|hawthorn]]s (''Crataegus'' spp.)\n* blueberries\n* [[honeysuckle]] (''Lonicera'' spp.)\n* mountain-laurel\n* viburnums\n* greenbriers\n* grapes\n{{Div col end}}\n\n====In the Loblolly Pine-Hardwood Type in the southern forest, mockernut commonly grows in the upland and drier sites with====\n{{Div col}}\n* [[white oak]] (''Quercus alba'')\n* post oak\n* [[northern red oak]] (''Q. rubra'')\n* [[southern red oak]] (''Q. falcata'')\n* scarlet oak\n* shagbark and pignut hickories\n* blackgum\n* flowering dogwood\n* hawthorn\n* sourwood\n* greenbrier\n* grape\n* honeysuckle\n* blueberry\n{{Div col end}}\n\n====In the southern bottom lands, mockernut occurs in the Swamp Chestnut Oak-Cherrybark Oak Type along with====\n{{Div col}}\n* [[green ash]] (''Fraxinus pennsylvanica'')\n* [[white ash]]\n* shagbark\n* [[Carya laciniosa|Shellbark hickory]] (''Carya laciniosa'')\n* bitternut hickories\n* white oak\n* Delta post oak (''[[Quercus stellata]]'' var.

Mockernut male flowers are [[catkin]]s about {{convert|10|to|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and may be produced on branches from [[axil]]s of leaves of the previous season or from the inner scales of the terminal buds at the base of the current growth. The female flowers appear in short spikes on [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]s terminating in shoots of the current year. Flowers bloom in the spring from April to May, depending on latitude and weather. Usually the male flowers emerge before the female flowers. Hickories produce very large amounts of pollen that is dispersed by the wind.\n\nFruits are solitary or paired and globose, ripening in September and October, and are about {{convert|2.5|to|9.0|cm|in|abbr=on}} long with a short necklike base. The fruit has a thick, four-ribbed husk {{convert|3|to|4|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick that usually splits from the middle to the base. The nut is distinctly four-angled with a reddish-brown, very hard shell {{convert|5|to|6|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick containing a small edible [[Seed|kernel]].\n\n====Seed production and dissemination====\nThe seed is dispersed from September through December. Mockernut hickory requires a minimum of 25 years to reach commercial seed-bearing age. Optimum seed production occurs from 40 to 125 years, and the maximum age listed for commercial seed production is 200 years.\n\nGood seed crops occur every 2 to 3 years with light seed crops in intervening years. Approximately 50 to 75 percent of fresh seed will germinate. Fourteen mockernut hickory trees in southeastern Ohio produced an average annual crop of 6,285 nuts for 6 years; about 39 percent were sound, 48 percent aborted, and 13 percent had insect damage. [[Hickory shuckworm]] (''Laspeyresia caryana'') is probably a major factor in reducing germination.\n\nMockernut hickory produces one of the heaviest seeds of the hickory species; cleaned seeds range from 70 to 250 seeds/kg (32 to 113/lb). Seed is disseminated mainly by gravity and wildlife, particularly squirrels. Birds also help disperse seed. Wildlife such as squirrels and chipmunks often bury the seed at some distance from the seed-bearing tree.\n\n====Seedling development====\nHickory seeds show embryo dormancy that can be overcome by [[Stratification (botany)|stratification]] in a moist medium at 1\u00b0 to 4&nbsp;\u00b0C (33\u00b0 to 40&nbsp;\u00b0F) for 30 to 150 days. When stored for a year or more, seed may require stratification for only 30 to 60 days. Hickory nuts seldom remain viable in the ground for more than I year. Hickory species normally require a moderately moist seedbed for satisfactory seed germination, and mockernut hickory seems to reproduce best in moist [[plant litter|duff]]. Germination is [[hypogeal germination|hypogeal]].\n\nMockernut seedlings are not fast-growing. The height growth of mockernut seedlings observed in the Ohio Valley in the open or under light shade on red clay soil was as follows:\n\n{|\n! Age\n! colspan=\"2\" | Height\n|-\n| (yr) || (cm) || (in)\n|-\n| 1    || 8    || 3.0\n|-\n| 2    || 12   || 4.7\n|-\n| 3    || 20   || 8.0\n|-\n| 4    || 32   || 12.5\n|-\n| 5    || 51   || 20.0\n|-\n| 6    || 71   || 28.0\n|}\n\n====Vegetative reproduction====\nTrue hickories sprout prolifically from stumps after cutting and fire. As the stumps increase in size, the number of stumps that produce sprouts decreases; age is probably directly correlated to stump size and sprouting. Coppice management is a possibility with true hickories. True hickories are difficult to reproduce from cuttings. Madden discussed the techniques for selecting, packing, and storing hickory propagation wood. Reed indicated that the most tested hickory species for root stock for pecan hickory grafts were mockernut and water hickory (''[[Carya aquatica]]'').\n\nHowever, mockernut root stock grew slowly and reduced the growth of pecan tops. Also, this graft seldom produced a tree that bore well or yielded large nuts.\n\n===Sapling and pole stages to maturity===\n\n====Growth and yield====\nMockernut hickory is a large, true hickory with a dense crown. This species occasionally grows to about {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|91|cm|in|abbr=on}} in [[d.b.h.]], but heights and diameters usually range from about {{convert|15|and|46|to|61|cm|in|abbr=on}}, respectively.\n\nThe relation of height to age is as follows:\n\n{|\n!\n! colspan=\"4\" | Height\n|-\n! Age\n! colspan=\"2\" | Cumberland Mountains\n! colspan=\"2\" | Mississippi Valley\n|-\n| (yr) || (m) || (ft) || (m) || (ft)\n|-\n| 10 || 1.2 || 4 || 2.7 || 9\n|-\n| 20 || 5.2 || 17 || 5.5 || 18\n|-\n| 30 || 7.9 || 26 || 7.6 || 25\n|-\n| 40 || 10.1 || 33 || 9.1 || 30\n|-\n| 60 || 13.7 || 45 || 12.2 || 40\n|-\n| 80 || 16.8 || 55 || 14.9 || 49\n|-\n| 100 || 20.1 || 66 || 17.4 || 57\n|-\n| 120 || 23.2 || 76 || 19.8 || 65\n|-\n| 160 || 28.7 || 94 || 24.4 || 80\n|-\n| 200 || 33.2 || 109 || 29.0 || 95\n|}\n\nThe current annual growth of mockernut hickory on dry sites is estimated at about 1.0 m\u00b3/ha (15&nbsp;ft\u00b3/acre). In fully stocked stands on moderately fertile soil2.1 m\u00b3 /ha (30&nbsp;ft\u00b3 /acre) is estimated, though annual growth rates of 3.1 m\u00b3/ha (44&nbsp;ft\u00b3/acre) were reported in Ohio (26). Greenwood and bark weights for commercial-size mockernut trees from mixed hardwoods in Georgia are available for total tree and saw-log stems to a 4-inch top for trees 5 to 22&nbsp;inches d.b.h..\n\nAvailable growth data and other research information is summarized for hickory species, not for individual species. Trimble compared growth rates of various Appalachian hardwoods including a hickory species category Dominant-codominant hickory trees {{convert|38|to|51|cm|in|abbr=on}} in d.b.h. on good oak sites grew slowly compared to northern red oak, yellow-poplar, [[black cherry]] (''Prunus serotina''), and [[sugar maple]] (''Acer saccharum''). Hickories were in the white oak, [[sweet birch]] (''Betula lenta''), and [[American beech]] (''Fagus grandifolia'') growth-rate category. Dominant-codominant hickory trees grew about {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}} d.b.h. per year compared to {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on}} for the moderate-growth species (black cherry) and {{convert|6|mm|in|abbr=on}} for the faster-growing species (yellow-poplar and red oak). Equations are available for predicting merchantable gross volumes from hickory stump diameters in Ohio. Also, procedures are described for predicting diameters and heights and for developing volume tables to any merchantable top diameter for hickory species in southern Illinois and West Virginia. Generally, [[epicormic shoot|epicormic branching]] is not a problem with hickory species, but a few branches do occur.\n\n====Rooting habit====\nTrue hickories such as mockernut develop a long [[taproot]] with few laterals. The species is [[windfirm]]. Early root growth is primarily into the taproot, which typically reaches a depth of {{convert|30|to|91|cm|in|abbr=on}} during the first year. Small laterals originate along the taproot, but many die back during the fall. During the second year, the taproot may reach a depth of {{convert|122|cm|in}}, and the laterals grow rapidly. After 5 years, the root system attains its maximum depth, and the horizontal spread of the roots is about double that of the crown. By age 10, the height is 4 times the depth of the taproot.\n\n====Reaction to competition====\nAt certain times during its life, mockernut hickory may be variously classified as [[Physiological tolerance|tolerant]] to intolerant. Overall it is classified as intolerant of shade. It recovers rapidly from suppression and is probably a climax species on moist sites.\n\n[[Silviculture|Silvicultural]] practices for managing the oak-hickory type have been summarized. Establishing the seedling origin of hickory trees is difficult because of seed predators. Although infrequent bumper seed crops usually provide some seedlings, seedling survival is poor under a dense canopy. Because of prolific sprouting ability, hickory reproduction can survive browsing, breakage, drought, and fire. Top dieback and resprouting may occur several times, each successive shoot reaching a larger size and developing a stronger root system than its predecessors. By this process, hickory reproduction gradually accumulates and grows under moderately dense canopies, especially on sites dry enough to restrict reproduction of more tolerant but more fire or drought-sensitive species.\n\nWherever adequate hickory advance reproduction occurs, [[clearcutting]] results in new sapling stands containing some hickories. It is difficult to attain reproduction if advance hickory regeneration is inadequate, however; then clearcutting will eliminate hickories except for stump sprouts. In theory, light thinnings or [[shelterwood]] cuts can be used to create advance hickory regeneration, but this has not been demonstrated.\n\n====Damaging agents====\nMockernut hickory is extremely sensitive to fire because of the low insulating capacity of the hard, flinty bark. Mockernut is not subject to severe loss from disease. The main fungus of hickory is ''Poria spiculosa'', a trunk rot. This fungus kills the bark, which produces a canker, causes heart rot and decay, and can seriously degrade the tree. Mineral streaks and [[sapsucker]]-induced streaks also degrade the lumber. In general, the hard, strong, and durable wood of hickories makes them relatively resistant to decay fungi. Most fungi cause little, if any, decay in small, young trees.\n\nCommon foliage diseases include leaf mildew and witches' broom (''[[Microstroma juglandis]]''), leaf blotch (''[[Mycosphaerella dendroides]]''), and pecan scab (''[[Cladosporium effusum]]''). Mockernut hickory is host to [[anthracnose]] (''Gnomonia caryae'').\n\nNuts of all hickory species are susceptible to attack by the hickory nut weevil (''[[Curculio caryae]]''). Another weevil (''[[Conotrachelus aratus]]'') attacks young shoots and leaf [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]s. The ''Curculio'' species are the most damaging and can destroy 65 percent of the hickory nut crop. Hickory shuckworms also damage nuts.\n\nThe bark beetle (''[[Scolytus quadrispinosus]]'') attacks mockernut hickory, especially in drought years and where hickory species are growing rapidly. The hickory spiral borer (''[[Argilus arcuatus]] torquatus'') and the pecan carpenterworm (''[[Cossula magnifica]]'') are also serious insect enemies of mockernut. The hickory bark beetle probably destroys more sawtimber-size mockernut trees than any other insect. The hickory spiral borer kills many seedlings and young trees, and the pecan carpenterworm degrades both trees and logs. The twig girdler (''[[Oncideres cingulata]]'') attacks both small and large trees; it seriously deforms trees by sawing branches. Sometimes these girdlers cut hickory seedlings near ground level.\n\nTwo [[casebearer]]s (''Acrobasis caryivorella'' and ''A. juglandis'') feed on buds and leaves; later they bore into succulent hickory shoots. Larvae of ''A. caryivorella'' may destroy entire nut sets. The living-hickory borer (''[[Goes pulcher]]'') feeds on hickory boles and branches throughout the East. Borers commonly found on dying or dead hickory trees or cut logs include:\n\n* the banded hickory borer (''[[Knulliana cincta]]'')\n* a long-horned beetle (''[[Saperda discoidea]]'')\n* the apple twig borer (''[[Amphicerus bicaudatus]]'')\n* the flatheaded ambrosia beetle (''[[Platypus compositus]]'')\n* the redheaded ash borer (''[[Neoclytus acuminatus]]'')\n* the false powderpost beetle (''[[Scobicia bidentata]]'')\n\nSevere damage to hickory lumber and manufactured hickory products is caused by powderpost beetles (''[[Lyctus]]'' spp. and ''[[Polycanon stoutii]]''). Gall insects (''[[Caryomyia]]'' spp.) commonly infest leaves. The fruit-tree [[leafroller]] (''[[Archips argyrospila]]'') and the hickory leafroller (''[[Argyrotaenia juglandana]]'') are the most common leaf feeders. The giant bark aphid (''[[Longistigma caryae]]'') is common on hickory bark. This aphid usually feeds on twigs and can cause branch mortality. The European fruit [[lecanium]] (''[[Parthnolecanium corni]]'') is common on hickories.\n\nMockernut is not easily injured by ice glaze or snow, but young seedlings are very susceptible to frost damage. Many birds and animals feed on the nuts of mockernut hickory. This feeding combined with insect and disease problems eliminates the annual nut production, except during bumper seed crop years.\n\n==Special uses==\n[[File:CaryaTomentosaBark.jpg|right|thumb|Closeup of Bark]]Mockernuts are preferred mast for wildlife, particularly squirrels, which eat green nuts. Black bears, foxes, rabbits, beavers, and white-footed mice feed on the nuts, and sometimes the bark. The white-tailed deer browse on foliage and twigs and also feed on nuts. Hickory nuts are a minor source of food for ducks, quail, and turkey.\n\nMockernut hickory nuts are consumed by many species of birds and other animals, including wood duck, red-bellied woodpecker, red fox, squirrels, beaver, eastern cottontail, eastern chipmunk, turkey, white-tailed deer, white-footed mice, and others. Many insect pests eat hickory leaves and bark. Mockernut hickories also provide cavities for animals to live in, such as woodpeckers, black rat snakes, raccoons, Carolina chickadees, and more. They are also good nesting trees, providing cover for birds with their thick foliage. Animals help disperse seeds so that new hickories can grow elsewhere. Chipmunks, squirrels, and birds do this best. Some fungi grow on mockernut hickory roots, sharing nutrients from the soil.<ref name=\"Mockernut hickory\">''Mockernut hickory.'' (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.fcps.edu/islandcreekes/ecology/mockernut_hickory.htm</ref>\n\nTrue hickories provide a very large portion of the high-grade hickory used by industry. Mockernut is used for lumber, [[pulpwood]], [[charcoal]], and other fuelwood products. Hickory species are preferred species for fuelwood consumption. Mockernut has the second highest heating value among the species of hickories. It can be used for [[Wood veneer|veneer]], but the low supply of logs of veneer quality is a limiting factor.\n\nMockernut hickory is used for tool handles requiring high shock resistance. It is used for ladder rungs, athletic goods, agricultural implements, dowels, gymnasium apparatus, poles, shafts, well pumps, and furniture. Lower grade lumber is used for pallets, blocking, and so on. Hickory sawdust, chips, and some solid wood are often used by packing companies to smoke meats, and mockernut is the preferred wood for smoking hams. Though mockernut kernels are edible, because of their size they are rarely eaten by humans.\n\nMockernut hickory is used for smoking meats such as ham.<ref name=\"Miller\">Miller, J.H., & Miller, K.V. (1999). ''Forest plants of the southeast and their wildlife uses''. Champaign, IL: Kings Time Printing.</ref>\n\n==Genetics==\nThe mockernut is a 64 chromosome species and therefore very rarely if ever crosses with 32 chromosome species such as pecan or shellbark hickory. There is no published information concerning population or other genetic studies of this species.\n\nHickories are noted for their variability, and many natural hybrids are known among North American species. Hickories usually can be crossed successfully within the genus. Geneticists recognize that mockernut hickory hybridizes naturally with: ''C. illinoensis'' (''Carya'' x ''schneckii'' Sarg.) and ''C. ovata'' (''Carya'' x ''collina'' Laughlin).\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{commons category|Carya tomentosa}}\n*Baker, Frederick S. 1949.

The native range is from Maryland and extreme southern [[New Jersey]] and southeast [[Pennsylvania]] south to central Florida, west to eastern Texas, and north to southern [[Missouri]] and [[Kentucky]]. The plant's habitat is dry sandy and rocky uplands and ridges mixed with [[oak]] and [[hickory]] to 1000 m elevation. It grows best on well-drained soils in full sun or partial shade.\n\n==Growth==\nIt is a spreading shrub or small tree, reaching 2\u20138 m in height at maturity. The [[bark]] is red- or gray-brown and slightly furrowed into scaly plates. The [[leaf|leaves]] are simple, narrowly elliptical or lanceolate, yellow-green above and paler and finely hairy on the underside. Each leaf is 7.5\u201315&nbsp;cm long by 3\u20135&nbsp;cm wide with parallel side veins ending in short pointed teeth. The flowers are monoecious and appear in early summer. Male flowers are small and pale yellow to white, borne on erect [[catkin]]s 10\u201315&nbsp;cm long attached to the base of each leaf. Female flowers are 3&nbsp;mm long and are located at the base of some catkins. The fruit is a golden-colored [[Calybium and cupule|cupule]] 2\u20133&nbsp;cm in diameter with many sharp spines, maturing in autumn. Each cupule contains one ovoid shiny dark brown nut that is edible.\n\n==Habitat==\nThe Allegheny chinquapin is closely related to the [[American chestnut]], ''Castanea dentata'', and both trees can be found in the same habitat. Allegheny chinquapin can be distinguished by its smaller nut (half the size of a chestnut) that is not flattened (chestnuts are flattened on one side). The leaves of the Allegheny chinquapin are smaller than the American chestnut and have less distinct teeth. Allegheny chinquapin, however, is less susceptible to the [[chestnut blight]] fungus that devastated the American chestnut. While the chinquapin does blight to some degree, it continues to send out [[basal shoot|suckers]] that will produce fruit. Chinquapins are quite vulnerable nevertheless, and there are many reports of heavily diseased and cankered trees.\n\n==Uses==\n[[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] of  [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] made the first record of the tree and its nuts in 1612, observing its use by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Native Americans made an infusion of chinquapin leaves to relieve headaches and fevers. The bark, leaves, wood, and seed husks of the plant contain [[tannin]]. The wood is hard and durable and is sometimes used in [[fence]]s and fuel, but the plant is too small for the wood to be of commercial importance.\n\nChinquapins are used in landscapes for the purpose of attracting wildlife. When the base of plant is cut or wounded at ground level the plant will grow multiple stalks producing a thick cover used by turkeys. The nuts are consumed by squirrels and rabbits while white tail deer graze upon the foliage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wildlife Gardening: Chinquapin Tree |url=http://www.preppergarden.biz/Chinquapin-Bush-for-Preppers-p/nut-chinquapin.htm|publisher=Prepper Gardens|accessdate=January 23, 2014}}</ref>{{Verify credibility|date=October 2014}}\n==References==\n{{more footnotes|date=October 2014}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Little, Elbert L.

Common names include '''sugarberry''', '''Southern hackberry''', or in the southern U.S. '''sugar hackberry''' or just '''hackberry'''.\n\nSugarberry is easily confused with common hackberry (''[[Celtis occidentalis|C. occidentalis]]'') where the range overlaps.  Sugarberry has narrower leaves which are smoother above.  The species can also be distinguished by habitat: where the ranges overlap, common hackberry occurs primarily in upland areas, whereas sugarberry occurs mainly in bottomland areas.\n\nSugarberry's range extends from the [[Eastern United States]] west to [[Texas]] and south to northeastern [[Mexico]].<ref name=\"GRIN\"/> It is also found on the island of [[Bermuda]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conservation.bm/southern-hackberry/ |title=Southern Hackberry (''Celtis laevigata'') |work=Bermuda's Species |publisher=Department of Conservation Services, Government of Bermuda |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n\nSugarberry occurs primarily along streams and in moist soils on [[floodplain]]s.  Its fruit are eaten by [[bird]]s, helping to [[Seed dispersal#By animals|disperse]] the [[seed]]s.  The leaves are eaten by a number of insects, for example [[caterpillar]]s of the Io moth (''[[Automeris io]]'').\n\nSugarberry's [[Plant litter|leaf litter]] contains [[Allelopathy|allelopathic chemicals]] that inhibit seed germination and growth in many other plant species.<ref>M.A.K.

The  remarkable bark pattern is even more pronounced in younger trees, with the irregularly-spaced ridges resembling long geologic palisades of sedimentary [layered] rock formations when viewed edge-wise [cross-section]. Coins as large as USA quarters can easily be laid flat against the valleys, which may be as deep as an adult human finger.\n\nThe leaves are distinctly asymmetrical and coarse-textured.  It produces small fruits that turn orange-red to dark purple in the [[autumn]], often staying on the trees for several months.  The common hackberry is easily confused with the [[sugarberry]] (''[[Celtis laevigata]]'') and is most easily distinguished by range and habitat.

The leaves are eaten by four gall-producing insects of the ''[[Pachypsylla]]'' genus, which do not cause serious damage to the tree.  A number of insects and fungi cause rapid decay of dead branches or roots of the tree.\n\nThe small berries, hackberries, are eaten by a number of birds and mammals.  Most seeds are dispersed by animals, but some seeds are also dispersed by water.\n\nThe tree serves as a butterfly larval host particularly the [[hackberry emperor]].<ref>http://www.nativeplantcenter.net/?q=plants/1211</ref>\n\n== Cultivation and uses ==\n[[File:Bodjos sombor.jpg|thumb|right|One of the streets with 'bo\u0111o\u0161' in Sombor, Serbia]]\nHackberry's wood is light yellow; heavy, soft, coarse-grained, not strong.

It is the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[Oklahoma]].\n\n[[Image:Memorial Chapel Cercis canadensis redbud.JPG|thumb|left|240px|[[University of Maryland Arboretum & Botanical Garden]] with the [[Memorial Chapel (University of Maryland)]] in the background]]\n[[Image:Redbud.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Eastern redbud blossoms]]\n[[Image:RedbudsOhio.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Detail of buds]]\n\n==Description==\nIt typically grows to {{convert|6|-|9|m|0|abbr=on}} tall with an {{convert|8|-|10|m|0|abbr=on}} spread. It generally has a short, often twisted [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] and spreading [[branch]]es. A 10-year-old tree will generally be around {{convert|5|m|0|abbr=on}} tall. The [[bark]] is dark in color, smooth, later scaly with ridges somewhat apparent, sometimes with maroon patches. The [[twig]]s are slender and zigzag, nearly black in color, spotted with lighter [[lenticel]]s. The winter buds are tiny, rounded and dark red to chestnut in color. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, simple, and heart shaped with an entire margin, {{convert|7|\u2013|12|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and wide, thin and papery, and may be slightly hairy below.\n\nThe [[flower]]s are showy, light to dark magenta pink in color, {{convert|1.5|cm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}} long, appearing in clusters from Spring to early Summer, on bare stems before the leaves, sometimes on the trunk itself. The flowers are pollinated by long-tongued bees such as blueberry bees and carpenter bees. Short-tongued bees apparently cannot reach the nectaries. The [[fruit]] are flattened, dry, brown, [[pea]]-like pods, {{convert|5|\u2013|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long that contain flat, elliptical, brown [[seed]]s {{convert|6|mm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long, maturing in August to October.\n\nIn some parts of southern Appalachia, green twigs from the eastern redbud are used as seasoning for wild game such as venison and opossum. Because of this, in these mountain areas the eastern redbud is sometimes known as the spicewood tree.\n\nIn the wild, eastern redbud is a frequent native understory tree in mixed forests and hedgerows. It is also much planted as a [[landscape]] [[ornamental plant]]. The leaves are eaten by the [[caterpillar]]s of some [[Lepidoptera]], for example the [[Automeris io|Io moth]] (''Automeris io'').\n\n[[File:Cercis canadensis 'Forest Pansy' JPG1Fe.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''Cercis canadensis'' 'Forest Pansy' leaves.]]\n[[File:Cercis Canadensis Leaf.png|thumb|''C. canadensis'' Leaf]]\n[[Image:Xylocopa 9789.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Carpenter bee]] (''[[Eastern carpenter bee|Xylocopa virginica]]'') on redbud flowers.]]\n[[File:Cardinalis cardinalis in Cercis canadensis.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''[[Northern cardinal|Cardinalis cardinalis]]'' male feeding female, in a white-flowered ''C. canadensis'']]\n\nIn the United States, this tree is difficult to grow further west into arid areas west of western [[Kansas]] and [[Colorado]], as there is not sufficient annual precipitation. Its far northern range of growth is the lower Midwest, Ohio Valley, to the south of Boston. There has been success with growing the tree in [[Columbus, Wisconsin]], which has become known as the \"Columbus Strain\" and a seed source for nurseries.\n\n* Bark: Red brown, with deep fissures and scaly surface. Branchlets at first lustrous brown, later become darker.\n* Wood: Dark reddish brown; heavy, hard, coarse-grained, not strong. Sp. gr., 0.6363; weight of cu. ft. 39.65&nbsp;lbs.\n* Winter buds: Chestnut brown, obtuse, one-eighth inch long.\n* Leaves: Alternate, simple, heart-shaped or broadly ovate, two to five inches long, five to seven-nerved, chordate or truncate at the base, entire, acute. They come out of the bud folded along the line of the midrib, tawny green; when they are full grown they become smooth, dark green above, paler beneath. In autumn they turn bright clear yellow. Petioles slender, terete, enlarged at the base. Stipules caduceous.\n* Flowers: April, May, before and with the leaves, papilionaceous. Perfect, rose color, borne four to eight together, in fascicles which appear at the axils of the leaves or along the branch and sometimes on the trunk itself.\n* Calyx: Dark red, campanulate, oblique, five-toothed, imbricate in bud.\n* Corolla: Papilionaceous, petals five, nearly equal, pink or rose color, upper petal the smallest, enclosed in the bud by the wings, and encircled by the broader keel petals.\n* Stamens: Ten, inserted in two rows on a thin disk, free, the inner row rather shorter than the others.\n* Pistil: Ovary superior, inserted obliquely in the bottom of the calyx tube, stipitate; style fleshy, incurved, tipped with an obtuse stigma.\n* Fruit: Legume, slightly stipitate, unequally oblong, acute at each end. Compressed, tipped with the remnants of the style, straight on upper and curved on the lower edge. Two and a half to three inches long, rose color, full grown by midsummer, falls in early winter. Seeds ten to twelve, chestnut brown, one-fourth of an inch long -can be made to germinate by first dipping in boiled (99C) water (very hot) for a minute and then sowing in a pot (do not boil the seeds); cotyledons oval, flat.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book| last =Keeler| first =Harriet L.| title =Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them| publisher =Charles Scriber's Sons| year =1900| location =New York| pages =104\u2013108}}</ref>\n\n==Cultivation==\n''C. canadensis'' is grown in parks and gardens, with several [[cultivars]] being available.

It prefers habitats where the soil is saturated with water at least during the majority of the growing season. The soils in these regions have a thick organic layer, often classified as a [[soil horizon#Diagnostic surface horizons of mineral soils|histic surface horizon]], with sandy material at greater depths and poor drainage. Atlantic white cedar wetlands are acidic and there is little oxygen stored in the soil because water has displaced the air.  Plants that live in these environments must be specially adapted to such conditions.\n\nThough the tree is not listed as threatened, Atlantic white cedar wetlands are considered a globally threatened ecosystem, and often serve as [[carbon sinks]] because of their [[peat]]-building abilities.<ref name=\"mylecraine_rangewide\" /><ref name=\"biological_report\" /><ref name=\"crawford\">{{cite journal|author=Crawford ER|title=Influence of environment and substrate quality on root decomposition in naturally regenerating and restored Atlantic white cedar wetlands|journal=Wetlands|date=2007|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1\u201311|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1672/0277-5212(2007)27[1:ioeasq]2.0.co;2}}</ref>\n\n===Ecology===\n[[Red maple]] and [[Nyssa sylvatica|black gum]] trees are often found in the canopy along with Atlantic white cedar throughout its range.

This keep the tree from being underwater year-round and helps to protect from floods.

Too frequent or intense fires or flooding are damaging to seedlings stored in the top layer of soil and full-grown trees.<ref name=\"plantsprofile\" />\n\n==Description==\n''C. thyoides'' is an [[evergreen]] [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] [[tree]] usually growing to 20\u201328 m (but may grow up to 35 m) tall with an average diameter of 0.8 m (up to 2 m) and feathery foliage in moderately flattened sprays, green to [[glaucous]] blue-green in color. The [[leaf|leaves]] are scale-like, 2\u20134&nbsp;mm long, and produced in opposite [[decussate]] pairs on somewhat flattened shoots; seedlings up to a year old have needle-like leaves. The tree is bare of branches for 3/4 of the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] height and the [[bark]] can be ash-gray to reddish brown.  Bark is smooth on juveniles, but mature trees have deep ridges and bark as thick as 5&nbsp;cm. ''C. thyoides'' is [[monoecious]], so a single tree will carry both the pollen and seeds needed for reproduction in cones.  The [[conifer cone|seed cones]] are [[globose]], 4\u20139&nbsp;mm diameter, with 6-10 scales (1-2 seeds per scale), green or purple, maturing to brown in 5\u20137 months after pollination. The pollen cones are yellow but turn brown as the tree matures, 1.5\u20133&nbsp;mm long and 1\u20132&nbsp;mm broad, releasing their yellow pollen once a year in spring.<ref name=farjon/><ref name=rushforthc>Rushforth, K.

The most common use of white cedar wood is lumber, for which stands usually require 70 years of growth from [[germination]] to harvest.  The lumber may be used in house construction, though scarcity of Atlantic white cedar makes it difficult to be used as the primary material.  The wood was favored for use as roof shingles because it is lightweight, but has since been replaced by cheaper and more fire-resistant materials such as asphalt.  The durability of the [[heartwood]] makes it popular for use as siding and paneling, and the less resistant sapwood has been used for interior finishes. White cedar lumber has also been used in [[Boat building|boat construction]], but this requires much older, larger trees.  [[North Carolina]] is the greatest producer of lumber for boat construction because it has the greatest number of [[Old-growth forest|old-growth]] ''C. thyoides'' forests.

In the 1630s, a delegation of local Indians is said to have approached Samuel Wyllys, the early settler who owned and cleared much of the land around it, encouraging its preservation and describing it as planted ceremonially, for the sake of peace, when their tribe first settled in the area.\n\n{{quote|text=It has been the guide of our ancestors for centuries as to the time of planting our corn; when the leaves are the size of a mouse's ears, then is the time to put the seed into the ground.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book| last =Keeler\n  | first =Harriet L.\n  | title =Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them\n  | publisher =Charles Scriber's Sons\n  | year =1900\n  | location =New York\n  | pages =328\u2013332 }}</ref>}}\n\n===Charter Oak incident===\n{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}\nThe name \"Charter Oak\" stems from the local legend in which a cavity within the tree was used in late 1687 as a hiding place for the Charter of 1662. \n\nThis much regarding the charter is history:\n* [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] granted the [[Connecticut Colony]] an unusual degree of autonomy in 1662.\n* His successor [[James II of England|James II]] consolidated several colonies into the [[Dominion of New England]] in 1686, in part to take firmer control of them.\n* He appointed Sir [[Edmund Andros]] as governor-general over it, who stated that his appointment had invalidated the charters of the various constituent colonies. He went to each colony to collect their charters, presumably seeing symbolic value in physically reclaiming the documents.\n* Andros arrived in Hartford late in October 1687, where his mission was at least as unwelcome as it had been in the other colonies.\n\nAccording to the dominant tradition, Andros demanded the document and it was produced, but the lights were suddenly doused during ensuing discussion. The [[parchment]] was spirited out a window and thence to the Oak by Captain Joseph Wadsworth, ancestor of [[Elijah Wadsworth]].\n\nTwo documents{{cn|date=August 2016}} raise less dramatic possibilities, one contemporaneous and one from early in the next century, by suggesting that a parchment copy had been made of the true charter as early as June, in anticipation of Andros's arrival:\n* It has been suggested that the copy was surreptitiously substituted for the original and the original secreted in the oak lest Andros find it in any search of buildings, and that Andros left believing that he had succeeded.\n* Logically, such a copy (whether hidden in the oak or not) might instead have been the one kept, for the value it might have in [[propaganda]], for [[morale]], or in [[petition]]ing for its reinstatement.\n\nThe Museum of Connecticut History (a subdivision of the [[Connecticut State Library]]) credits the idea that Andros never got the original charter, and displays a parchment that it regards as the original.  (The [[Connecticut Historical Society]] is said{{by whom?|date=August 2015}} to possess a \"fragment\" of it.)\n\nAndros was overthrown in Boston two years later in the [[1689 Boston revolt]].  The Dominion of New England was then dissolved.\n\n==Relics==\n\n[[File:Charter Oak Chair, made from the historical Charter Oak Tree, Hartford, Conn (68389).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Charter Oak Chair shown on a postcard]]\n\nThe oak was blown down in a violent storm on August 21, 1856 and timber from it was made into a number of chairs now displayed in the Hartford Capitol Building.  The desk of the Governor of Connecticut and the chairs for the Speaker of the House of Representatives and President of the Senate in the state capitol were made from wood salvaged from the Charter Oak.\n\nA wooden baseball made from the Charter Oak was presented by the Charter Oak Engine Co.

Found principally on the limestone cliffs of Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina, but it is hardy at the north to zone 4.\n\nThe largest specimen known is at [[Spring Grove Cemetery]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], 22 m tall and 2.2 m trunk diameter; the tallest known is a slender tree 27 m tall but only 0.55 m trunk diameter, at [[Plott Cove Research Natural Area]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (Spongberg & Ma 1997; Eastern Native Trees Society).\n\nPlants from Alabama have the leaves more densely hairy underneath than those from further north, and are distinguished as ''Cladrastis kentukea'' f. ''tomentosa'' (Steyermark) Spongberg.\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Cladrastis kentukea'' is widely grown as an [[ornamental tree]] for its attractive flowers, and is locally [[naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] in many areas of the eastern United States outside of its restricted [[native plant|native]] range.<ref name=Keeler /> It thrives in full sunlight and in well-drained soil,  tolerates high pH soils as well as acid situations. The Yellowwood can withstand urban settings and is attractive to birds. A number of [[cultivar]]s have been selected, including 'Perkin's Pink' (syn. 'Rosea', an invalid name) with pink flowers.\n\nKentucky yellowwood is recommended as one of the best medium-sized trees for cultivation as an [[ornamental plant]] in [[garden]]s.  The only quality that is mentioned is a tendency of the trunk to divide very near the ground, as a multi-trunked tree.<ref name=Keeler /> [[File:Yellow_WoodTree_Bark_and_low_branching-Cladrastis_kentukea,_family_Fabaceae.jpg|thumb|right|bark and low branching habit]]\n\n==Uses==\nThe name yellowwood derives from its yellow [[heartwood]], used in small amounts for specialist [[furniture]], [[stock (firearm)|gunstocks]] and decorative [[woodturning]].\n==Distinctions==\n\nThe [[Society of Municipal Arborists]] selected the yellowwood (''Cladrastis kentukea'' or ''C. lutea'') as its Urban Tree of the Year for 2015. \n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Andrews, S.

The tree is extremely showy when in bloom, but what appear to be four, white petals are actually four spreading [[bract]]s below the cluster of inconspicuous yellow-green flowers. The blossoms appear in late spring, weeks after the tree leafs out.\n\nIt can be distinguished from the flowering dogwood (''[[Cornus florida]]'') of eastern North America by its more upright habit, flowering about a month later, and by the pointed rather than rounded flower bracts.\n\nThe [[fruit]] is a globose pink to red compound [[berry (botany)|berry]] 2\u20133&nbsp;cm in diameter, though these berries tend to grow larger towards the end of the season and some berry clusters that do not fall from the tree exceed 4&nbsp;cm. It is edible, a sweet and delicious addition to the tree's ornamental value. The fruit is sometimes used for making wine.<ref>[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&taxon_id=242443980 \"''Cornus kousa'' subsp. ''chinensis''\"] at eFloras.org.

The tree grows wild but has been cultivated for its fruit and wood since prehistoric times by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].\n\n''Diospyros virginiana'' grows through {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}}, in well-drained soil. In summer, this species produces fragrant flowers which are [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], so one must have both male and female plants to obtain fruit. Most cultivars are [[parthenocarpic]] (setting seedless fruit without pollination). The flowers are [[Pollination|pollinated]] by insects and wind. Fruiting typically begins when the tree is about 6 years old.\n\nThe fruit is round or oval and usually orange-yellow, sometimes bluish, and from 2 to 6&nbsp;cm (0.79 to 2.4 in) in diameter. In the U.S. South and Midwest, the fruits are referred to as simply persimmons or \"'simmons\", and are popular in desserts and cuisine.\n\nCommercial varieties include the very productive Early Golden, the productive John Rick, Miller, Woolbright and the Ennis, a seedless variety. Another nickname of the American persimmon, 'date-plum' also refers to a persimmon species found in South Asia, ''[[Diospyros lotus]]''.\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Persimmon.jpg|thumb|left|American persimmon tree bearing fruit in the fall]]\n[[File:Persimmon 0375.jpg|thumb|right|Flower]]\nIt is a small tree usually 30 through 80 feet (10 through 24 meters) in height, with a short, slender trunk and spreading, often pendulous branches, which form a broad or narrow, round-topped canopy.

In the male flowers, which are numerous, the stamens are sixteen in number and arranged in pairs; the female flowers are solitary, with traces of stamens, and a smooth ovary with one ovule in each of the eight cells\u2014the ovary is surmounted by four styles, which are hairy at the base. The fruit-stalk is very short, bearing a [[subglobose]] fruit an inch in diameter or a bit larger, of an orange-yellow color, ranging to bluish, and with a sweetish astringent pulp.  It is surrounded at the base by the persistent calyx-lobes, which increase in size as the fruit ripens.  The astringency renders the fruit somewhat unpalatable, but after it has been subjected to the action of frost, or has become partially rotted or \"[[bletting|bletted]]\" like a [[medlar]], its flavor is improved.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Persimmon |inline=1 |volume=21 |page=252}}</ref>\n* Bark: Dark brown or dark gray, deeply divided into plates whose surface is scaly.  Branchlets slender, zigzag, with thick pith or large pith cavity; at first light reddish brown and pubescent.  They vary in color from light brown to ashy gray and finally become reddish brown, the bark somewhat broken by longitudinal fissures.  Astringent and bitter.\n* Wood: Very dark; sapwood yellowish white; heavy, hard, strong and very close grained.  Specific gravity, 0.7908; weight of cubic foot, {{convert|49.28|lb|abbr=on}}.  The heartwood is a true [[ebony]].  Forestry texts indicate that about a century of growth is required before a tree will produce a commercially viable yield of ebony wood.\n* Winter buds: Ovate, acute, one-eighth of an inch long, covered with thick reddish or purple scales.  These scales are sometimes persistent at the base of the branchlets.\n* Leaves: Alternate, simple, four to six inches (152&nbsp;mm)  long, oval, narrowed or rounded or cordate at base, entire, acute or acuminate.  They come out of the bud revolute, thin, pale, reddish green, downy with ciliate margins, when full grown are thick, dark green, shining above, pale and often pubescent beneath.  In autumn they sometimes turn orange or scarlet, sometimes fall without change of color.  Midrib broad and flat, primary veins opposite and conspicuous.  Petioles stout, pubescent, one-half to an inch in length.\n* Flowers: May, June, when leaves are half-grown; di\u0153cious or rarely polygamous.  Staminate flowers borne in two to three-flowered cymes; the pedicels downy and bearing two minute bracts.  Pistillate flowers solitary, usually on separate trees, their pedicels short, recurved, and bearing two bractlets.\n* Calyx: Usually four-lobed, accrescent under the fruit.\n* Corolla: Greenish yellow or creamy white, tubular, four-lobed; lobes imbricate in bud.\n* Stamens: Sixteen, inserted on the corolla, in staminate flowers in two rows.  Filaments short, slender, slightly hairy; anthers oblong, introrse, two-celled, cells opening longitudinally.  In pistillate flowers the stamens are eight with aborted anthers, rarely these stamens are perfect.\n* Pistil: Ovary superior, conical, ultimately eight-celled; styles four, slender, spreading; stigma two-lobed.\n* Fruit: A juicy berry containing one to eight seeds, crowned with the remnants of the style and seated in the enlarged calyx; depressed-globular, pale orange color, often red-cheeked; with slight bloom, turning yellowish brown after freezing.

However, as it is attractive to raccoons, rodents, and smaller animals, the loss of large grazing herbivores and omnivores in historical times has not seriously affected the tree's survival strategy as compared to [[Kentucky Coffeetree]] and [[Osage Orange]] which are inedible to most extant wildlife and saw their ranges greatly diminish without [[mastodon]]s and other dispersal agent fauna.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  A 2015 study supports the notion that elephants would have been a more effective disperser of the seeds than living North American mammals <ref>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1656/058.014.0109</ref>\n\n==Uses==\nThe peculiar characteristics of its fruit have made the tree well known.  This fruit is a globular berry, with variation in the number of seeds, sometimes with eight and sometimes without any.  It bears at its apex the remnants of the styles and sits in the enlarged and persistent calyx.  It ripens in late autumn, is pale orange with a red cheek, often covered with a slight glaucous bloom.  One joke among Southerners is to induce strangers to taste unripe persimmon fruit, as its very astringent bitterness is shocking to those unfamiliar with it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  Folklore states that frost is required to make it edible, but fully ripened fruit lightly shaken from the tree or found on the ground below the tree is sweet, juicy and delicious.  The peculiar astringency of the fruit is due to the presence of a tannin similar to that of ''[[Cinchona]]''.  The seeds were used as buttons during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BeA1AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA234&dq=persimmon+seed+buttons&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vQ27UZeGL8bw0QGGjoCIDg&ved=0CEgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=persimmon%20seed%20buttons&f=false|title=Domestic Economy in the Confederacy|first=David|last=Dodge|year=1886|journal=The Atlantic Monthly |volume=58|issue=August|pages=229\u2013241}}</ref>\n\nThe fruit is high in [[vitamin C]]. The unripe fruit is extremely [[astringent]]. The ripe fruit may be eaten raw, cooked or dried. [[Molasses]] can be made from the fruit pulp. A [[Herbal tea|tea]] can be made from the leaves and the roasted seed is used as a [[coffee]] substitute. Other popular uses include desserts such as persimmon [[pie]], [[persimmon pudding]], or [[persimmon candy]].\n\nThe fruit is also fermented with [[hops]], [[cornmeal]] or [[wheat bran]] into a sort of beer or made into brandy.  The wood is heavy, strong and very close-grained and used in [[woodturning]].<ref name=EB1911 />\n\n==Cultivation==\nThe tree prefers light, sandy, well-drained soil, but will grow in rich, southern, bottom lands.  It can be grown in northern Ohio only with the greatest of care, and in southern Ohio its fruit is never edible until after frost.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nThe tree is greatly inclined to vary in the character and quality of its fruit, in size this varies from that of a large cherry to a small apple.  Some trees in the south produce fruit that is delicious without the action of the frost, while adjoining trees produce fruit that never becomes edible.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nIt was brought to England before 1629 and is cultivated, but rarely if ever ripens its fruit.  It is easily raised from seed and can also be propagated from [[stolon]]s, which are often produced in great quantity.  The tree is hardy in the south of England and in the Channel Islands.<ref name=EB1911 />\n\nIn respect to the power of making [[heartwood]], the persimmon rarely develops any heartwood until it is nearly one hundred years old.  This heartwood is extremely close-grained and almost black, resembling [[ebony]] (of which it is a true variety).<ref name=Keeler /><ref>The ebony of commerce is derived from five different tropical species of the genus, two from [[India]] and one each from [[Africa]], [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] and [[Mauritius]].  The beautiful variegated [[Calamander wood|coromandel wood]] is the product of a species found in [[Ceylon]].</ref>\n\nIt is a common misconception persimmon fruit needs frost to ripen and soften, called [[bletting]]. Some, such as the early-ripening varieties \"pieper\" and \"NC21\"(also known as \"supersweet\"), easily lose astringency and become completely free of it when slightly soft at the touch\u2014these are then very sweet, even in the British climate. On the other hand, some varieties (like the very large fruited \"yates\", which is a late ripening variety) remain astringent even when the fruit has become completely soft (at least in the British climate). Frost, however, destroys the cells within the fruit, causing it to rot instead of ripen. Only completely ripe and soft fruit can stand some frost; it will then dry and become even sweeter (hence the misconception). The same goes for the Oriental persimmon (''[[Diospyros kaki]]''), where early frost can severely damage a fruit crop.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikispecies}}\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=divi5 USDA Plants Profile for ''Diospyros virginiana'' (common persimmon)]\n*[http://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=DIVI5 Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center\u2014Native Plant Information Network (NPIN): ''Diospyros virginiana'' (Common persimmon, Eastern persimmon)]\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/divi5.htm Bioimages.vanderbilt.edu: ''Diospyros virginiana'' images]\n*[http://www.persimmonpudding.com Persimmonpudding.com - dedicated to growing, education, and use of ''Diospyros virginiana'', the Common or American persimmon]\n*[http://www.treetrail.net/diospyros.html Treetrail.net: ''Diospyros virginiana'' (American Persimmon) Native Range Distribution Map]\n{{Commons category|position=left}}\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n[[Category:Diospyros|virginiana]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Crops originating from the United States]]\n[[Category:Dioecious plants]]\n[[Category:Plants used in Native American cuisine]]\n[[Category:Native American cuisine of the Southeastern Woodlands]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]",

The genus name ''[[wikt:fagus#Latin|Fagus]]'' is [[Latin]] for \"beech\", and the species name ''[[wikt:grandifolius#Latin|grandifolia]]'' comes from ''grandis'' \"large\" and ''folium'' \"leaf\".\n\n==Distribution and varieties==\nThe American beech is native to eastern [[North America]], from [[Nova Scotia]] west to [[Southern Ontario|southern]] [[Ontario]] in southeastern [[Canada]], west to [[Wisconsin]] and south to eastern [[Texas]] and northern [[Florida]] in the [[United States]].\n\nTrees in the southern half of the range are sometimes distinguished as a variety, ''F. grandifolia'' var. ''caroliniana'', but this is not considered distinct in the Flora of North America. The Mexican beech (''Fagus mexicana''), native to the mountains of central [[Mexico]], is closely related, and is sometimes treated as a subspecies of American beech, but more often as a distinct species. The only ''Fagus'' species found in the Western Hemisphere (assuming ''F. mexicana'' is treated as a subspecies), ''F. grandifolia'' is believed to have spanned the width of the North American continent all the way to the Pacific coast before the [[Quaternary glaciation|last ice age]].\n\n== Description ==\nIt is a [[deciduous]] [[tree]] growing to {{convert|20|-|35|m|abbr=on}} tall, with smooth, silver-gray [[bark]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] are dark green, simple and sparsely-toothed with small teeth that terminate each vein, {{convert|6|-|12|cm|abbr=on}} long (rarely {{convert|15|cm}}), with a short [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]. The winter twigs are distinctive among North American trees, being long and slender ({{convert|15|-|20|mm|abbr=on}} by {{convert|2|-|3|mm|abbr=on}}) with two rows of overlapping scales on the buds. Beech buds are distinctly thin and long, resembling cigars; this characteristic makes beech trees relatively easy to identify. The tree is [[plant sexuality|monoecious]], with flowers of both sexes on the same tree. The [[fruit]] is a small, sharply-angled [[nut (fruit)|nut]], borne in pairs in a soft-spined, four-lobed husk. It has two means of reproduction: one is through the usual dispersal of seedlings, and the other is through root sprouts (new trees sprout from the roots in different locations).<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Emad |last1=Farahat |first2=Martin J. |last2=Lechowicz |title=Functional Ecology of Growth in Seedlings Versus root Sprouts of Fagus grandifolia Ehrh. |journal=Trees |year=2013 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=337\u2013340 |doi=10.1007/s00468-012-0781-9}}</ref>\n\nThe American beech is a shade-tolerant species, favoring shade more than other trees{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}, commonly found in forests in the final stage of [[Ecological succession|succession]].

Near its southern limit, it often shares canopy dominance with [[Magnolia grandiflora|Southern Magnolia]]. Although it has a reputation for slow growth (sometimes only 13 feet in 20 years), rich soil and ample moisture will greatly speed the process up. American beech favors a well-watered, but also well-drained spot and is intolerant of urban pollution, salt, and soil compaction. It also casts dense shade and has an extensive network of shallow, fibrous surface roots that make gardening underneath it almost impossible. Because American beech needs plenty of moisture and rich soil to thrive, it naturally occurs in bottomland forests. Early settlers often looked for beeches as a sign of a good potential place to clear the forest for farming.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFagus grandifolia, beltsville, md 2014-04-16-16.01.20 ZS PMax (13902703865).jpg|The long and thin winter bud of a beech\nFagus grandifolia beech leaves close.jpg|Spring leaves\nFile:2014-10-30 13 24 34 American Beech foliage during autumn in the woodlands along the West Branch Shabakunk Creek in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|Autumn foliage\nAmerican Beech.jpg|Beech leaf and nut\n2014-12-30 12 23 58 American Beech sapling in the woods near Metzger Drive at the College of New Jersey in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|In the winter, some fall leaves stay on beech trees ([[marcescence]])\nFile:American Beech Fagus grandifolia Bark.JPG|Bark\nFile:American Beech Fagus grandifolia Feet.JPG|The foot of the tree\n</gallery>\n\n== Disease ==\n[[Beech bark disease]] has become a major killer of beech trees in the Northeastern United States. This disease occurs when the beech scale insect, ''[[Cryptococcus fagisuga]]'', attacks the bark, creating a wound that is then infected by one of two different species of [[Fungus|fungi]] in the genus ''[[Nectria]]''. This causes a canker to develop and the tree is eventually killed.\n\n[[Beech blight aphid]]s colonize branches of the tree, but without serious harm to otherwise healthy trees. Below these colonies, deposits of [[sooty mold]] develop caused by the fungus ''[[Scorias spongiosa]]'' growing [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophytically]] on the [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]] the insects exude. This is also harmless to the trees.<ref>[http://tomvolkfungi.net/ Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month]</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:American Beech Fagus grandilolia Trunk.JPG|thumb|right|A carving in the bark of the tree]]\nAmerican beech is an important tree in [[forestry]]. The wood is heavy, hard, tough and strong, and until the advent of power tools in the 20th century, lumbering beech trees were often left uncut to grow. As a result, many areas today still have extensive groves of old beeches that would not otherwise occur. Today, the wood is harvested for uses such as flooring, containers, furniture, handles and woodenware.\n\nLike [[European beech]] bark, the American beech bark is smooth and uniform, making it an attraction for vandals to carve names, dates, gang symbols, and other material into its surface.<ref>David Martin, [http://www.dcdave.com/poet15/091130.htm Smooth Bark Compulsion]</ref> One such beech tree in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], in what is now the southern part of [[Iroquois Park]], bore the legend \"[[Daniel Boone|D. Boone]] kilt a [[bear|bar]]\" and the year in the late 18th century. This carving was first reported in the 19th century, but is believed to have not been produced by Boone since he was an educated man who would not have written something so semi-literate. The beech finally fell over in 1916 during a storm; its age was estimated at around 325 years. Its trunk is now on display at [[The Filson Historical Society]].\n\nIt is sometimes planted as an ornamental tree, but even within its native area, it is planted much less often than the European beech. Although American beech can handle hotter climates,<ref>Gardening with Native Plants of the South by Sally and Andy Wasowski, p.44</ref> its European variant is faster-growing and more pollution-tolerant, in addition to being easier to propagate.\n\nAmerican beech can take up to 40 years to begin producing seeds. Large crops are produced by 60 years and the tree's total lifespan may be up to 300 years. The fruit is a triangle-shaped shell containing 2-3 nuts inside, but many of them do not fill in, especially on solitary trees. Beech nuts are edible to humans, although too small to be commercially valuable.\n\nThe [[mast (botany)|mast]] (crop of nuts) from American beech provides food for numerous species of animals. Among [[vertebrate]]s alone, these include ruffed grouse, wild turkeys, raccoons, red/gray foxes, white-tailed deer, rabbits, squirrels, opossums, pheasants, black bears, porcupines, and humans. For [[lepidoptera]]n [[caterpillar]]s feeding on American beech, see [[list of Lepidoptera that feed on beeches]]. Beech nuts were one of the primary foods of the now-extinct [[passenger pigeon]]; the clearing of beech and [[oak]] forests are pointed to as one of the major factors that may have contributed to the bird's extinction.<ref>[http://rmmc.asu.edu/abstracts/nrm/vol18-4/conrpag1.pdf] Jon M.

It is found in [[mesophytic]] [[hardwood]] [[forest]]s from [[Nova Scotia]] west to [[Minnesota]], south to northern [[Florida]], and southwest to eastern [[Texas]]. Isolated populations have also been found in western [[Texas]], [[Wyoming]] and [[Colorado]], and the species is reportedly naturalized in [[Hawaii]].<ref name=grin>{{GRIN|316687|Fraxinus americana}}</ref><ref>[http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id=369468 Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families,  ''Fraxinus americana'']</ref><ref>{{BONAP|ref|genus=Fraxinus|species=americana}}</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe name White Ash derives from the [[glaucous]] undersides of the leaves. It is similar in appearance to the [[Green Ash]], making identification difficult. The lower sides of the leaves of White Ash are lighter in color than their upper sides, and the outer surface of the twigs of White Ash may be flaky or peeling. Green Ash leaves are similar in color on upper and lower sides, and twigs are smoother. Despite some overlap, the two species tend to grow in different locations as well; White Ash is a forest tree that commonly occurs alongside [[Sugar Maple]] while Green Ash is a [[pioneer species]] that inhabits [[riparian zones]] and disturbed areas.<ref name=ncp>Common Trees of the North Carolina Piedmont: [http://www.ibiblio.org/openkey/intkey/web/FRAM2.htm ''Fraxinus americana'']</ref><ref name=nb>New Brunswick tree and shrub: [http://scf.rncan.gc.ca/subsite/mx-212/whiteash ''Fraxinus americana'']</ref>\n\n[[File:2015-10-21 10 57 30 White Ash foliage during autumn along Pennington Road (New Jersey Route 31) in Ewing, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|left|Autumn foliage]]\n\n== Cultivation and uses ==\n\nWhite ash is one of the most used trees for everyday purposes and, to keep up with high demand, is cultivated almost everywhere it can be. The wood is white and quite dense (within 20% of 670&nbsp;kg/m3),<ref name=\"White Ash\">[http://www.nichetimbers.co.uk/north-american-hardwood/ash/ White Ash], ''Niche Timbers''. Retrieved on 2009-07-24.</ref> strong, and straight-grained. It is the timber of choice for production of [[baseball bat]]s and tool handles. The wood is also favorable for furniture and [[Wood flooring|flooring]]. Woodworkers use the timber mainly for interior uses due to high perishability in contact with ground soil.<ref name=\"White Ash\" /> It is also used to make [[lobster trap]]s. Since the 1950s, it has also become a popular choice for solid [[electric guitar]] bodies.<ref name=\"Tech Talk: Ash and Alder\">[http://www2.fender.com/experience/tech-talk/tech-talk-ash-and-alder/]</ref> It makes a very servicable [[longbow]] if properly worked. The wood was used in ceiling fan blades from the 1970s through the mid-1980s, though cane was sometimes simulated with plastic then. It is no longer used for ceiling fan blades in most countries.\n\nWhite Ash is not seen in cultivation as often as Green Ash due to its preference for undisturbed forest sites away from urban pollution and soil compaction, but sometimes has been planted for its consistently reliably autumn colors, which typically are bright orange and red hues as opposed to other species of ash that produce a uniform yellow color.\n\nA related species, Biltmore Ash, is sometimes treated as a variety of White Ash. However, other taxonomists argue that Biltmore Ash is its own species (''Fraxinus biltmoreana'').<ref>Nesom, G.L. (2010) \"Fraxinus biltmoreana and Fraxinus smallii (Oleaceae): forest trees of the eastern United States\".

University of North Carolina Herbarium, Chapel Hill, NC</ref>\n\n== Emerald ash borer ==\n{{Main|Emerald ash borer}}\nThe emerald ash borer (''Agrilus planipennis''), also commonly known by the [[acronym]] EAB, is a green [[beetle]] native to Asia.\n\nIn [[North America]] the [[emerald ash borer]] is an invasive species, highly destructive to ash trees in its introduced range. The damage of this insect rivals that of [[Chestnut blight]] and [[Dutch Elm Disease]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Bruce Schlink|title=Americans Held Hostage by the Environmentalist Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7mkXBaIFpuAC&pg=PA494&lpg=PA4940|year=2012|publisher=Dorrance Publishing|page=494|isbn=978-1-4349-7536-2}}</ref> To put its damage in perspective, the number of [[chestnuts]] killed by the [[Chestnut blight]] was around 3.5 billion chestnut trees while there are 3.5 billion ash trees in [[Ohio]] alone. [[Dutch Elm Disease]] killed only 200 million elm trees while EAB threatens 7.5 billion ash trees in the United States. The insect threatens the entire North American genus ''Fraxinus'', while past invasive tree pests have only threatened a single species within a genus. Since its accidental introduction into the United States and Canada in the 1990s, and its subsequent detection in 2002, it has spread to eleven states and adjacent parts of Canada. It has killed at least 50 million ash trees so far and threatens to kill most of the ash trees throughout North America. The green ash and the black ash trees are affected. White ash is also killed rapidly, but usually only after green and black ash trees are eliminated. Blue ash displays some resistance to the emerald ash borer by forming callous tissue around EAB galleries; however, they are usually killed. White ash has been less affected by emerald ash borer due to its small population (unlike its cousin, ''F. americana'' is not commonly seen in cultivation) compared to green ash, which was planted in huge numbers as an ornamental.<ref>[http://joa.isa-arbor.com/request.asp?JournalID=1&ArticleID=3011&Type=2 Andrea C.

Its fall foliage is yellow. Black ash is one of the first trees to lose its leaves in the fall.  It is very closely related to [[Fraxinus mandschurica|Manchurian ash]], and will easily hybridize with it. Some consider the two to be geographic isolates of each other.\n\nBlack ash is a food plant for the [[larva]]e of several species of [[Lepidoptera]]; see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on ashes]].\n\nThe species was considered abundant and its survival of little concern prior to the invasion of the [[emerald ash borer]], first detected in North America in 2002.  However, since that time this invasive insect has spread throughout most of the tree's range, and within a few years black ash is expected to be all but extirpated; a similar fate awaits green ash.  In 2014, a U.S. Forest Service agent estimated that \"ninety-nine percent of the ashes in North America are probably going to die.\"  [[Blue ash]] and [[white ash]] are only slightly less affected.<ref>{{cite newspaper |title=After the Trees Disappear |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=30 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\nThis wood is used by Native Americans of the North East for making baskets and other devices. The [[Shakers]] also made extensive use of the Black Ash for creating baskets. Also called Basket Ash, Brown Ash, Swamp Ash, hoop ash, and water ash.\nIt is also a popular wood for making electric guitars and basses, due to its good resonant qualities.<ref>[http://www.jemsite.com/jem/wood.htm Guitar Wood FAQ \u2013 Wood Types & Tones<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n== Creating basket strips ==\n[[File:Kelly church black ash basket.jpg|thumb|left|Black ash splint basket by [[Kelly Church]] ([[Odawa]]-[[Ojibwe]])]]\nBlack ash is unique among all trees in North America in that it does not have fibers connecting the growth rings to each other. This is a useful property for basket makers. By pounding on the wood with a mallet, the weaker spring wood layer is crushed, allowing the tougher and darker summer wood layer to be peeled off in long strips. The long strips are trimmed, cleaned, and used in [[basket weaving]]. [[Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands]] also make bark baskets from black ash, traditionally used for berry-gathering.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Fraxinus|nigra]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Western Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of humid continental climate]]\n[[Category:Least concern plants]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]",

That epidemic was the result of a similar overuse of elms in urban environments, leading to a [[monoculture]] that lacked any disease or pest resistance. Scientifically for red ash this is because modern cultivars utilized regionally were parented from sometimes only four individual trees selected for unique traits and male seedless flowering. Proclaiming a harsh lesson learned, cities like Chicago did not replace dead elms with a 1:1 ash:elm ratio. Instead, Norway, silver, red and sugar maples, honey locust, linden/basswood, redbud, crabapples and hackberry, among others, were also utilized during this recovery period and in new urban and suburban areas. Fortunately, with these additional species, many cities were able to reduce the percent of ash and other species to much lower levels (20% average) than during the Dutch elm disease era where from 56% to 100% of the trees were elm.\n\nBoth American elm and green ash were extremely popular due to rapid growth and tolerance of urban pollution and road salt, so many housing developments in [[Michigan]] were lined from end to end with ashes, a result of which the beetles had an enormous food supply to boost their population well above Infestation thresholds. The tree was also extensively propagated and sold by local nurseries. According to the American Nursery Industry, \"Back in the late 1980s, Dr. Frank Santamour Jr., then a research geneticist with the U.S. National Arboretum, proposed the 10-20-30 formula for diversity in the urban forest, limiting the plantings in a community to no more than 10 percent within a single species, 20 percent within a genus and 30 percent within a family.\"\"\u00a0Because of EAB today, many communities  are using a more strict 20 -10-5 rule.\n\nThe emerald ash borer proved to be a far worse and potentially more serious threat than epidemics of the past such as chestnut blight and Dutch elm disease because those diseases spread at a slower rate, only affected one species, and did not kill the trees before they could attain reproductive maturity. Many areas have banned the sale of ash seedlings in nurseries, although seeds may be sold as they are not a vector for the insect.\n\n== Uses ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== Urban ornamental trees ===\n[[File:2014-10-29 13 12 58 Green Ash foliage during autumn coloration in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|thumb|right|Autumn leaf color]]\nGreen ash is one of the most widely planted [[ornamental plant|ornamental trees]] throughout the [[United States]] and much of [[Canada]] but mostly [[Alberta]], including in western areas where it is not native.

Modernizing cities in [[Russia]] and [[China]] then began using imported green ash a century ago to line streets and landscape new public parks.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} When one Chinese city's original collection, which had survived into late 1980's suddenly all died, city fathers used trees by sending them back to America as wooden crates containing Chinese made parts supplying the American auto industry.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Advantages of green ash include its tolerance of harsh urban environmental conditions, ease of propagation, and (in eastern North America) its value for wildlife as a native [[keystone species]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ash Tree Identification|url=http://www.nyis.info/?action=eab_ash_tree_identification|website=New York Invasive Species Information|publisher=Cornell University Cooperative Extension|accessdate=5 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\nGreen ash [[wood]] is similar in properties to [[Fraxinus americana|white ash]] wood, and is marketed together as \"white ash\". The commercial supply is mostly in the South. It is very popular, used in making [[electric guitar]]s because it can be somewhat lighter than white ash without sacrificing too much in tone. It has a bright sound with long sustain, plus the wood grain is aesthetically desirable to many guitar players.

The leaflets are {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2.5|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} (smaller on bipinnate leaves) and bright green. They turn yellow in the fall ([[autumn]]). Honey locusts leaf out relatively late in spring, but generally slightly earlier than the [[black locust]] (''[[Robinia pseudoacacia]]''). The strongly scented cream-colored [[flower]]s appear in late spring, in clusters emerging from the base of the [[leaf axil]]s.\n\nThe [[fruit]] of the honey locust is a flat [[legume]] (pod) that matures in early autumn. The pods are generally between {{convert|15|\u2013|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}. The pulp on the insides of the [[legume|pods]] is edible, unlike the [[black locust]], which is toxic. The seeds are dispersed by grazing [[herbivore]]s such as [[cattle]] and [[horse]]s, which eat the pod pulp and excrete the seeds in droppings; the animal's digestive system assists in breaking down the hard seed coat, making germination easier. In addition, the seeds are released in the host's manure, providing fertilizer for them. Honey locust seed pods ripen in late spring and germinate rapidly when temperatures are warm enough.\n\nHoney locusts commonly have [[spine (botany)|thorns]] {{convert|3|\u2013|10|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long growing out of the branches, some reaching lengths over {{convert|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}; these may be single, or branched into several points, and commonly form dense clusters. The thorns are fairly soft and green when young, harden and turn red as they age, then fade to ash grey and turn brittle when mature. These thorns are thought to have evolved to protect the trees from browsing [[Pleistocene megafauna]] which may also have been involved in seed dispersal, but the size and spacing of them is useless in defending against smaller extant herbivores such as deer. Thornless forms (''Gleditsia triacanthos'' var. ''inermis'') are occasionally found growing wild and are available as nursery plants. Hybridization of honey locust with [[Gleditsia aquatica|water locust]] (''G. aquatica'') has been reported.<ref>{{Cite web | author = Sullivan J. | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/gletri/all.html | title = ''Gleditsia triacanthos'' | date = 1994 | accessdate = August 13, 2014 | website = U.S. Forest Service | publisher = U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory}}</ref>\n\n== Cultivation and history ==\nIts [[cultivar]]s are popular [[ornamental plant]]s, especially in the northern plains of North America where few other trees can survive and prosper. It tolerates urban conditions, compacted soil, road salt, alkaline soil, heat, and drought. The popularity is in part due to the fact that it transplants so easily. The fast growth rate and tolerance of poor site conditions make it valued in areas where shade is wanted quickly, such as new parks or housing developments, and in disturbed and reclaimed environments, such as mine tailings. It is resistant to [[gypsy moth]]s but is defoliated by another pest, the [[mimosa webworm]]. [[Spider mite]]s, [[canker]]s, and [[gall]]s are a problem with some trees. Many cultivated varieties do not have thorns.\n\n== Food ==\n[[File:Unripe honey locust pods.jpg|thumb|right|Unripe honey locust pods]]\nDespite its name, the honey locust is not a significant [[honey]] plant.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} The name derives from the sweet taste of the legume pulp, which was used for food by Native American people, and can also be fermented to make [[beer]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} The long pods, which eventually dry and ripen to brown or maroon, are surrounded in a tough, leathery skin that adheres very strongly to the pulp within. The pulp\u2014bright green in unripe pods\u2014is strongly sweet, crisp and succulent in ripe pods. Dark brown tannin-rich beans are found in slots within the pulp.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n== Timber ==\nHoney locusts produce a high quality, durable wood that polishes well, but the tree does not grow in sufficient numbers to support a bulk industry; however, a niche market exists for honey locust furniture. It is also used for posts and rails since it takes a long time to rot. In the past, the hard thorns of the younger trees were used as [[nail (engineering)|nails]] while the wood itself was used to fashion [[treenail]]s for shipbuilding.\n\n== Agriculture ==\n[[File:Gleditsia triacanthos MHNT.BOT.2006.0.1274.JPG|thumb|''Gleditsia triacanthos'' \u2013 [[MHNT]]]]\nThe species is a major invasive environmental and economic weed in agricultural regions of Australia. The plant forms thickets and destroys the pasture required for livestock to survive. The thickets choke waterways and prevent both domestic and native animals from drinking and also harbour [[vermin]].

Some jack pines are shrub-sized, due to poor growing conditions. They do not usually grow perfectly straight, resulting in an irregular shape similar to [[pitch pine]] (''Pinus rigida''). This pine often forms pure stands on sandy or rocky soil.  It is fire-adapted to stand-replacing fires, with the cones remaining closed for many years, until a forest fire kills the mature trees and opens the cones, reseeding the burnt ground.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are in fascicles of two, needle-like, twisted, slightly yellowish-green, and {{convert|2|-|4|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long.\n\nJack pine cones are usually {{convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and curved at the tip.<ref name=\"Moore2008\">{{cite book |author1=Moore, Gerry |author2=Kershner, Bruce |author3=Craig Tufts |author4=Daniel Mathews |author5=Gil Nelson |author6=Spellenberg, Richard |author7=Thieret, John W. |author8=Terry Purinton |author9=Block, Andrew |title=National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Trees of North America |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |year=2008 |page=68 |isbn=1-4027-3875-7}}</ref> The [[conifer cone|cones]] are {{convert|3|-|5|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} long, the scales with a small, fragile prickle that usually wears off before maturity, leaving the cones smooth.\n\nUnusually for a pine, the cones normally point forward along the branch, sometimes curling around it. That is an easy way to tell it apart from the similar lodgepole pine in more western areas of North America. The cones on mature trees are [[serotiny|serotinous]].  They open when exposed to intense heat, greater than or equal to {{convert|50|C|F}}. The typical case is in a fire, however cones on the lower branches can open when temperatures reach {{convert|27|C|F}} due to the heat being reflected off the ground.  Additionally, when temperatures reach {{convert|-46|C|F}}, the cones will open, due to the nature of the resin.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} {{clear|left}}\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Pinus banksiana forest.jpg|thumb|left|''P. banksiana'' forest with ''[[Vaccinium]]'' groundcover]]\n\n[[Kirtland's warbler]] (''Setophaga kirtlandii''), an [[endangered species|endangered]] [[bird]], depends on pure stands of young jack pine in a very limited area in the north of the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower]] and [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsulas]] of [[Michigan]] for breeding. Mature jack pine forests are usually open, and the fall of their needles creates acidic soil, so [[blueberries]] are often abundant in the [[understory]].\n\nYoung jack pines are an alternate host for [[Cronartium|sweet fern blister rust]] (''Cronartium comptoniae''). Infected [[Comptonia (plant)|sweet ferns]] (''Comptonia peregrina'') release powdery orange spores in the summer and nearby trees become infected in the fall. Diseased trees show vertical orange cankers on the trunk and galls on the lower branches. The disease does not tend to affect older trees.<ref name=\"eclectic\">Blouin, Glen. ''An Eclectic Guide to Trees: east of the rockies''. 2001. Boston Mills Press, Erin, Ontario. pp 152-159.</ref>\n\nJack pines are also susceptible to [[scleroderris canker]] (''Gremmeniella abietina''). This disease manifests by yellowing at the base of the needles. Prolonged exposure may lead to eventual death of the tree.<ref name=\"eclectic\" />\n\nInsects that attack jack pine stands include [[Pissodes strobi|white pine weevil]] (''Pissodes strobi''), jack pine sawfly, and jack pine budworm.<ref name=\"eclectic\" />\n\n== Commercial uses ==\nLike other species of pine, ''Pinus banksiana'' has use as timber, although its wood tends to be knotty and not highly resistant to decay.

Trees with {{convert|7|ft|m|disp=or|abbr=on}} (over mature) class range diameter at breast height were noted in the Imnaha River drainage as late as January 26, 2015.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n== Description ==\n''J. cinerea'' is a [[deciduous]] [[tree]] growing to {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, rarely {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Butternut is a slow-growing species, and rarely lives longer than 75 years.  It has a {{convert|40|\u2013|80|cm|in|abbr=on}} stem diameter, with light gray [[bark]].\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are [[pinnate]], {{convert|40|\u2013|70|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long, with 11\u201317 leaflets, each leaflet {{convert|5|\u2013|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|\u2013|5|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad. The whole leaf is downy-pubescent, and a somewhat brighter, yellower green than many other tree leaves.\n\n=== Flowering and fruiting ===\n[[File:Butternut nut.jpg|left|thumb|A butternut]]\nButternut flowers from April to June, depending upon location, about the same time as the new leaves appear. The species is [[monoecious]]. Male ([[staminate]]) flowers are inconspicuous, yellow-green slender [[catkin]]s that develop from auxiliary buds and female ([[pistillate]]) flowers are short terminal spikes on current year's shoots. Each female flower has a light pink [[stigma (botany)|stigma]]. Flowers of both sexes do not usually mature simultaneously on any individual tree.\n\nThe [[fruit]] is a lemon-shaped [[nut (fruit)|nut]], produced in bunches of two to six together; the nut is oblong-ovoid, {{convert|3|\u2013|6|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|\u2013|4|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad, surrounded by a green husk before maturity in midautumn.\n\nKey characteristics:\n* [[Alternate (botany)|Alternate]], [[compound leaves]]\n* Odd number of [[leaflet (botany)|leaflets]] \u2013 has a terminal leaflet\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n=== Soil and topography ===\nButternut grows best on stream banks and on well-drained soils. It is seldom found on dry, compact, or infertile soils. It grows better than [[black walnut]], however, on dry, rocky soils, especially those of limestone origin.\n\nButternut is found most frequently in coves, on stream benches and terraces, on slopes, in the talus of rock ledges, and on other sites with good drainage. It is found up to an elevation of {{convert|1500|m|ft}} in the Virginias \u2013 much higher altitudes than black walnut.\n\n=== Associated forest cover ===\nButternut is found with many other tree species in several hardwood types in the mixed mesophytic forest. It is an associated species in the following four northern and central forest cover types: sugar maple\u2013basswood, yellow poplar\u2013white oak\u2013northern red oak, beech\u2013sugar maple, and river birch\u2013sycamore. Commonly associated trees include [[basswood]] (''Tilia'' spp.), [[black cherry]] (''Prunus serotina''), [[beech]] (''Fagus grandifolia''), [[black walnut]] (''Juglans nigra''), [[elm]] (''Ulmus'' spp.), [[Tsuga|hemlock]] (''Tsuga canadensis''), [[hickory]] (''Carya'' spp.), [[oak]] (''Quercus'' spp.), [[red maple]] (''Acer rubrum''), [[sugar maple]] (''Acer saccharum''), [[yellow poplar]] (''Liriodendron tulipifera''), [[white ash]] (''Fraxinus americana''), and [[yellow birch]] (''Betula alleghaniensis''). In the northeast part of its range, it is often found with [[sweet birch]] (''Betula lenta'') and in the northern part of its range it is occasionally found with [[white pine]] (''Pinus strobus''). Forest stands seldom contain more than an occasional butternut tree, although in local areas, it may be abundant. In the past, [[West Virginia]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Indiana]], and [[Tennessee]] have been the leading producers of butternut timber.\n\n==== Canopy competition ====\nAlthough young trees may withstand competition from the side, butternut does not survive under shade from above. It must be in the overstory to thrive. Therefore, it is classed as intolerant of shade and competition.\n\n=== Diseases ===\n[[File:Dead Butternuts.jpg|left|thumb|Butternuts killed by [[butternut canker]]]]\n\n==== Butternut canker ====\nThe most serious disease of ''J. cinerea'' is butternut decline or butternut [[canker]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Butternut Canker|url=http://dontmovefirewood.org/gallery-of-pests/butternut-canker.html|work=Gallery of Pests|publisher=Don't Move Firewood|accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref>  In the past, the causal organism of this disease was thought to be a fungus, ''Melanconis juglandis''. Now this fungus has been associated with secondary infections and the primary causal organism of the disease has been identified as another species of fungus, ''[[Sirococcus clavigignenti-juglandacearum]]''. The fungus is spread by wide-ranging [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]],{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} so isolation of a tree offers no protection.\n\nSymptoms of the disease include dying branches and stems. Initially, cankers develop on branches in the lower crown. Spores developing on these dying branches are spread by rainwater to tree stems. Stem cankers develop 1 to 3 years after branches die. Tree tops killed by stem-girdling cankers do not resprout. Diseased trees usually die within several years. Completely free-standing trees seem better able to withstand the fungus than those growing in dense stands or forest. In some areas, 90% of the butternut trees have been killed. The disease is reported to have eliminated butternut from North and South Carolina.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The disease is also reported to be spreading rapidly in Wisconsin. By contrast, black walnut seems to be resistant to the disease.\n\n==== Hybrid resistance ====\nThe hybrid between butternut and the [[Juglans ailantifolia|Japanese walnut]] is commonly known as the 'buartnut' and shows resistance to the butternut canker.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Researchers are back-crossing butternut to buartnut, creating 'butter-buarts\" which should have more butternut traits than buartnuts. They are selecting for resistance to the butternut canker.\n\n==== Other pests ====\n[[Bunch disease]] also attacks butternut. Currently, the causal agent is thought to be a [[mycoplasma]]-like organism. Symptoms include a yellow [[witches' broom]] resulting from sprouting and growth of auxiliary buds that would normally remain dormant. Infected branches fail to become dormant in the fall and are killed by frost; highly susceptible trees may eventually be killed. Butternut seems to be more susceptible to this disease than black walnut.\n\nThe common [[grackle]] has been reported to destroy immature fruit and may be considered a butternut pest when populations are high.\n\nButternut is very susceptible to fire damage, and although the species is generally wind firm, it is subject to frequent storm damage.\n\n=== Conservation ===\nThe species is not listed as threatened federally in the US, but is listed as \"Special Concern\" in [[Kentucky]], \"Exploitably Vulnerable\" in [[New York State]], and \"Threatened\" in [[Tennessee]].<ref>[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=JUCI PLANTS Profile for Juglans cinerea (butternut) | USDA PLANTS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe [[Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada]] placed the butternut on the endangered species list in Canada in 2005.<ref name=\"SAR Registry\" />\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Butternut_sections.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Cross-sections from ''[[The American Woods]]'']]\n=== Lumber ===\nButternut wood is light in weight and takes polish well, and is highly rot resistant, but is much softer than [[black walnut]] wood. Oiled, the grain of the wood usually shows much light.  It is often used to make [[furniture]], and is a favorite of woodcarvers.\n\n=== Fabric dye ===\nButternut bark and nut rinds were once often used to dye cloth to colors between light yellow<ref>Snow, Charles Henry. ''The Principal Species of Wood: Their Characteristic Properties''.  2nd ed.  New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1908. Page 56.</ref> and dark brown.<ref>Saunders, Charles Francis.

Page 227.</ref>  To produce the darker colors, the bark is boiled to concentrate the color. This appears to never have been used as a commercial dye, but rather was used to color homespun cloth.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, inhabitants of areas such as [[southern Illinois]] and southern Indiana&nbsp;\u2013 many of whom had moved there from the Southern United States&nbsp;\u2013 were known as \"butternuts\" from the butternut-dyed homespun cloth that some of them wore.  Later, during the [[American Civil War]], the term \"butternut\" was sometimes applied to [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers. Some Confederate uniforms apparently faded from gray to a tan or light brown.  It is also possible that butternut was used to color the cloth worn by a small number of Confederate soldiers.<ref>Saunders, Charles Francis. ''Useful Wild Plants of the United States and Canada''. New York: [[Robert M. McBride]] & Co., 1920. Page 227.</ref>  The resemblance of these uniforms to butternut-dyed clothing, and the association of butternut dye with home-made clothing, resulted in this derisive nickname.\n\n=== Medicinal ===\nButternut bark has mild [[cathartic]] properties {{citation needed|date=October 2011}} and was once used medicinally in place of [[jalap]], a more expensive cathartic which was imported from Mexico.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, a butternut extract made from the inner bark of the tree was used in an attempt to prevent [[smallpox]], and to treat [[dysentery]] and other stomach and intestinal discomfort.<ref>Thatcher, James, M.D. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fHG1rHriGM0C&pg=PA251 ''A Military Journal During the American Revolutionary War''.] Boston: Cottons & Barnard, 1827.

It grows mostly in [[riparian zone]]s, from southern [[Ontario]], west to southeast [[South Dakota]], south to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], northern [[Florida]] and southwest to central [[Texas]]. Wild trees in the upper [[Ottawa Valley]] may be an isolated native population or may have derived from planted trees.\n\nBlack walnut is an important tree commercially, as the wood is a deep brown color and easily worked.  The fruits, walnuts, are cultivated for their distinctive and desirable taste. Often, trees are grown for both lumber and walnuts simultaneously and many cultivars have been developed for improved quality nuts or wood. Black walnut is currently under pressure from the [[thousand cankers disease]] which is causing decline of walnuts in some areas. Black walnut is also [[Allelopathy|allelopathic]] which means that it releases chemicals from roots and other tissues which harm other organisms and give the tree a competitive advantage; this is often undesirable as it can harm garden plants and grasses.\n\n== Description ==\n*'''Odor''' Most parts of the tree including leaves, stems, and fruit [[husk]]s have a very characteristic pungent or spicy odor. This odor is lacking in the nut itself.<ref name=\"peters\" /><ref name=\"dirr\" />\n*'''Trunk''' Height {{convert|30|-|40|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}. Under forest competition, it develops a tall and straight [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]].

The '''male''' ([[staminate]]) flowers are in drooping [[catkins]] {{convert|8|\u2013|10|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long. These are borne from axilary buds on the previous year's growth. The '''female''' ([[pistillate]]) flowers are terminal, in clusters of two to five on the current year's growth.<ref name=\":1\" />\n*'''Fruit''' Ripens during the autumn into a fruit (nut) with a brownish-green, semifleshy husk and a brown, corrugated nut. The whole fruit, including the husk falls in October or November; the seed is relatively small and very hard.\n\nThe fruit production tends to occur irregularly with some years producing larger crops than others (see [[mast year]]). Fruiting may begin when the tree is 4\u20136 years old, however large crops take 20 years. Total lifespan of ''J. nigra'' is about 130 years. Black walnut does not leaf out until late spring when the soil has warmed and all frost danger is past. Like other trees of the order [[Fagales]], such as oaks, hickories, chestnuts, and birches, it is monoecious, with wind-pollinated catkins. Male and female flowers are in separate [[spike (botany)|spikes]], and the female flowers typically appear before the male on a single tree ([[dichogamy]]). As a consequence, [[self-pollination]] is unlikely. However, individual trees usually are not self-sterile; if they are not pollinated by neighboring trees, they may set self-fertilized seeds.<ref name=\":1\" /> For maximum seed germination, the seeds should be [[cold-moist stratified]] for 3\u20134 months, although the exact time depends on the seed source.<ref name=\":1\" /> The seedlings emerge in April or May and typically grow {{convert|90|cm|in|round=5|abbr=on}} their first year and even more in the 2nd year.<ref name=\":1\" /> Black walnut often loses its leaves earlier than other deciduous trees growing in the same area after having a growing period of 115\u2013135 days.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBlack walnut has a strong [[taproot]] which makes the seedlings resilient, but difficult to transplant.\n\nBlack walnut is more resistant to frost than the [[English walnut|English]] or [[Persian walnut]], but thrives best in the warmer regions of fertile, lowland soils with high water tables, although it will also grow in drier soils, but much more slowly.<ref name=\"dirr\" /> Some soils preferred by black walnut include A[[Alfisol|lfisol]] and [[Entisol]] soil types.<ref name=\":1\">{{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Juglans |species=nigra |first=Robert D. |last=Williams |access-date=2016-06-29}}</ref> Walnut grows best on sandy loam, loam, or silt loam type soils but will also grow well on silty clay loam soils. It prefers these soils due to the fact that these soils hold large quantities of water which the tree draws from during dry periods.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nVisually, black walnut is similar to the [[butternut tree|butternut]] (''Juglans cinerea'') in leaf shape, and the range also overlaps significantly. The fruits are quite different, and their presence makes an identification easy, as black walnut fruits are round and butternuts are more oval-oblong shaped. When a fruit is not available, two species can be differentiated based on the [[leaf scar]]s, or the place where the leaf meets the stem: butternut has a leaf scar with a flat upper edge and with a velvety ridge above that flat part, but black walnut has an indented leaf scar with no hairy ridge.<ref>{{eFloras|1|116860|Juglans nigra}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nBlack walnut is primarily a [[pioneer species]] similar to [[red maple|red]] and [[silver maple]] and [[black cherry]]. Because of this, black walnut is a common weed tree found along roadsides, fields, and forest edges in the eastern US. It will grow in closed forests, but is classified as shade intolerant, this means it requires full sun for optimal growth and nut production .\n\nThe nuts are food for many rodents and make up to 10% of the diet of [[eastern fox squirrel]]s.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/jugnig/all.html|title=Juglans nigra|website=www.fs.fed.us|access-date=2016-06-29}}</ref> The nuts are also eaten by species of birds. The leaves are browsed by [[white tailed deer]],<ref name=\":0\" /> although they are not a preferred food. Squirrels benefit this species by distributing and burying the seeds; if the seeds are not reclaimed by the squirrel, they will germinate and help disperse the species.\n\nWhere the range of the eastern black walnut overlaps that of the Texas black walnut (''[[Juglans microcarpa|J.&nbsp;microcarpa]]''), the two species sometimes interbreed, producing populations with characteristics intermediate between the two species.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/jugmic/all.html|title=Juglans microcarpa|website=www.fs.fed.us|access-date=2016-06-29}}</ref> ''J.nigra'' and ''J. cinerea'' often grow in the same range as well but they do not hybridize naturally.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe tree's roots often form [[endomycorrhiza]]l relationships with fungi in the genus [[Glomus (fungus)|''Glomus'']]. Some endomycorrhizal relations improve the plant's growth.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nSpecies often associated with ''J. nigra'' include [[yellow-poplar]] (''Liriodendron tulipifera''), [[white ash]] (''Fraxinus americana''), [[black cherry]] (''Prunus serotina''), [[basswood]] (''Tilia americana''), [[American beech]] (''Fagus grandifolia''), [[sugar maple]] (''Acer saccharum''), [[oak]]s (''Quercus'' spp.), and [[hickory|hickories]] (''Carya'' spp.). Near the western edge of its range, black walnut may be confined to floodplains, where it grows either with [[American elm]] (''Ulmus americana''), [[common hackberry]] (''Celtis occidentalis''), [[green ash]] (''Fraxinus pennsylvanica''), and [[boxelder]] (''Acer negundo''), or with basswood and [[red oak]] (''Quercus rubra'') on lower slopes and other favorable sites.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Uses ==\n{{Nutritional value\n| name            = Walnut, black (''J.&nbsp;nigra'')\n| image           = Black Walnut Juglans nigra Nut 2400px.jpg\n| caption         = Black walnut\n| serving_size    = 100 grams\n| kJ              = 2586\n| carbs           = 9.91&nbsp;g\n| fat             = 59.00&nbsp;g\n| protein         = 24.06&nbsp;g\n| sugars          = 1.10&nbsp;g\n| sucrose         = 1.00&nbsp;g\n| glucose         = 0.05&nbsp;g\n| fructose        = 0.05&nbsp;g\n| satfat          = 3.368&nbsp;g\n| monofat         = 15.004&nbsp;g\n| polyfat         = 35.077&nbsp;g\n| omega3fat       = 2.006&nbsp;g\n| omega6fat       = 33.072&nbsp;g\n| fiber           = 6.8&nbsp;g\n| starch          = 0.24&nbsp;g\n| water           = 4.56&nbsp;g\n| calcium_mg      = 61\n| iron_mg         = 3.12\n| phosphorus_mg   = 513\n| magnesium_mg    = 201\n| manganese_mg    = 3.896\n| sodium_mg       = 2\n| potassium_mg    = 523\n| zinc_mg         = 3.37\n| vitA_ug         = 2\n| vitA_iu         = 40\n| thiamin_mg      = 0.057\n| riboflavin_mg   = 0.130\n| niacin_mg       = 0.470\n| pantothenic_mg  = 1.660\n| vitB6_mg        = 0.583\n| folate_ug       = 31\n| vitB12_ug       = 0\n| vitC_mg         = 1.7\n| vitD_ug         = 0\n| vitD_iu         = 0\n| vitE_mg         = 1.80\n| vitK_ug         = 2.7\n| source          = \n| source_usda     = 1\n}}\n\n=== Planting ===\nWhile its primary native region is the Midwest and east-central United States, the black walnut was introduced into Europe in 1629 and is also cultivated in Hawaii.<ref name=\":0\" /> It is cultivated there and in North America as a forest tree for its high-quality wood. Black walnut plantings can be made to produce timber, nuts, or both timber and nuts.  Patented timber-type trees were selected and released from [[Purdue University]] in the early 1990s.  These trees have been sporadically available from [[Plant nursery|nurseries]]. Varieties include Purdue #1, which can be used for both timber and nut production, though nut quality is poor compared to varieties selected specifically as nut producers.\n\n[[File:2014-10-30 10 16 45 Black Walnut foliage during autumn along Fireside Avenue in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|thumb|left|Autumn foliage]]\n[[Grafting|Grafted]], nut-producing trees are available from several nurseries operating in the U.S.  Selections worth considering include Thomas, Neel #1, Thomas Myers, Pounds #2, Stoker, Surprise, Emma K, Sparrow, S127, and McGinnis.  Several older varieties, such as Kwik Krop, are still in cultivation; while they make decent nuts, they would not be recommended for commercial planting.  A variety index and characteristics guide is available from [http://extension.missouri.edu/p/XM1001 Missouri Extension].\n\nPollination requirements should be considered when planting black walnuts.  As is typical of many species in Juglandaceae, ''Juglans nigra'' trees tend to be [[Sequential hermaphroditism|dichogamous]], i.e.. produce [[pollen]] first and then [[Gynoecium#Pistil|pistillate flowers]] or else produce pistillate flowers and then pollen. An early pollen-producer should be grouped with other varieties that produce pistillate flowers so all varieties benefit from overlap.  Cranz, Thomas, and Neel #1 make a good pollination trio.  A similar group for more northern climates would be Sparrow, S127, and Mintle.\n\nSometimes black walnut is planted as part of reclaiming mines.<ref name=\":0\" /> When growing young trees weed control is critical for healthy establishment of the trees, without weed control the young trees are harmed significantly in their growth rate.\n\n''J. nigra'' is also grown as a specimen ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, growing to {{convert|30|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall by {{convert|20|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} broad.<ref name=RHSAZ>{{cite book|title=RHS A-Z encyclopedia of garden plants|year=2008|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=United Kingdom|isbn=1-4053-3296-4|pages=1136}}</ref> It has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref>{{cite web|title=''Juglans nigra''|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=6235|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society|accessdate=23 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Food ===\nBlack walnut nuts are shelled commercially in the United States. About 65% of the annual wild harvest comes from the U.S. state of [[Missouri]], and the largest processing plant is operated by Hammons Products in [[Stockton, Missouri]]. The nutmeats provide a robust, distinctive, natural flavor and crunch as a food ingredient.  Popular uses include ice cream, bakery goods and confections.  Consumers include black walnuts in traditional treats, such as [[cake]]s, [[cookie]]s, [[fudge]], and [[pie]]s, during the fall holiday season.  The nuts' nutritional profile leads to uses in other foods, such as [[salad]]s, [[fish]], [[pork]], [[chicken]], vegetables and pasta dishes.\n\nNutritionally similar to the milder-tasting English walnut, the black walnut kernel is high in unsaturated fat and protein.  An analysis of nut oil from five named ''J.&nbsp;nigra'' cultivars (Ogden, Sparrow, Baugh, Carter and Thomas) showed the most prevalent fatty acid in ''J.&nbsp;nigra'' oil is [[linoleic acid]] (27.80\u201333.34&nbsp;g/100g dry kernel), followed (in the same units) by [[oleic acid]] (14.52\u201324.40), [[linolenic acid]] (1.61\u20133.23), [[palmitic acid]] (1.61\u20132.15), and [[stearic acid]] (1.07\u20131.69).<ref>Senter, S.

The juvenile leaves are found on young plants up to 3 years old, and as scattered shoots on adult trees, usually in shade. The [[conifer cone|seed cones]] are {{convert|3|-|7|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} long, [[Berry (botany)|berry]]-like, dark purple-blue with a white wax cover giving an overall sky-blue color (though the wax often rubs off); they contain one to three (rarely up to four) [[seed]]s, and are mature in 6\u20138 months from pollination. The [[juniper berry]] is an important winter food for many [[bird]]s, which disperse the wingless seeds. The [[pollen]] cones are {{convert|2|-|3|mm|in|frac=16|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1.5|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} broad, shedding pollen in late winter or early spring. The trees are usually [[plant sexuality|dioecious]], with pollen and seed cones on separate trees.<ref name=farjon /><ref name=gd /><ref name=adams />\n\nThere are two varieties,<ref name=fna /> which intergrade where they meet:<ref name=farjon /><ref name=gd /><ref name=adams />\n*''Juniperus virginiana'' var. ''virginiana'' is called eastern juniper / redcedar. It is found in eastern North America, from [[Maine]], west to southern [[Ontario]] and [[South Dakota]], south to northernmost [[Florida]] and southwest into the post oak savannah of east-central [[Texas]]. Cones are larger, {{convert|4|\u2013|7|mm|frac=16|abbr=on}}; scale leaves are acute at apex and bark is red-brown.\n*''Juniperus virginiana'' var. ''silicicola'' (Small) E.Murray (syn. ''Sabina silicicola'' Small, ''Juniperus silicicola'' (Small) L.H.Bailey) is known as southern or sand juniper / redcedar. Habitat is along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from the extreme Southeastern corner of [[Virginia]],<ref>http://www.dof.virginia.gov/infopubs/_outside-pubs/USDA-FS-SRS-155_outpub.pdf</ref> south to central [[Florida]] and west to southeast [[Texas]]. Cones are smaller, {{convert|3|\u2013|4|mm|frac=16|abbr=on}}; scale leaves are blunt at apex and the bark is orange-brown. It is treated by some authors at the lower rank of variety, while others treat it as a distinct species.\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Juniperus virginiana near Oxford, Ohio.jpg|left|thumb|Characteristic shape in old field succession]]\nEastern juniper is a [[pioneer species]], which means that it is one of the first trees to repopulate cleared, eroded, or otherwise damaged land.  It is unusually long lived among pioneer species, with the potential to live over 900 years. It is commonly found in [[prairie]]s or oak barrens, old pastures, or [[limestone]] hills, often along highways and near recent construction sites.<ref name=farjon /><ref name=gd /><ref name=\"NW-Barlow\" /> It is an alternate host for [[Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae|cedar\u2013apple rust]], an economically significant [[fungal disease]] of apples, and some management strategies recommend the removal of ''J. virginiana'' near apple orchards<ref name=wvu>[[West Virginia University]]: [http://www.caf.wvu.edu/kearneysville/disease_descriptions/omcar.html Cedar-Apple Rust, ''Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae'']</ref>\n\nIn many areas it is considered an [[invasive species]], even if native. It is [[fire-intolerant]], and was previously controlled by periodic [[wildfire]]s. Low branches near the ground burn and provide a ladder that allows fire to engulf the whole tree. Grasses recover quickly from low severity fires that are characteristic of prairies that kept the trees at bay. With the urbanization of prairies, the fires have been stopped with roads, plowed fields, and other fire breaks, allowing ''J. virginiana'' and other trees to invade.<ref>[http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/marktwain/projects/forest_plan/86_plan/Appendix_E.pdf Forest Plan]</ref> Trees are destructive to grasslands if left unchecked, and are actively being eliminated by cutting and [[prescribed burning]].<ref>Noble Foundation: [http://www.noble.org/Press_Release/Ag/EasternRedCedar/ArbuckleRestoration.html News Release]</ref> The trees also burn very readily, and dense populations were blamed for the rapid spread of wildfires in drought stricken [[Oklahoma]] and [[Texas]] in 2005 and 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0601/01/bn.02.html|title=Wildfires Rip Through Oklahoma|agency=[[CNN]]|date=January 1, 2006|accessdate=April 11, 2007}}</ref>\n\nEastern juniper benefits from increased [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] levels, unlike the grasses with which it competes.  Many grasses are [[C4 carbon fixation|C4 plants]] that concentrate CO<sub>2</sub> levels in their bundle sheaths to increase the efficiency of [[RuBisCO]], the enzyme responsible for [[photosynthesis]], while junipers are [[C3 carbon fixation|C3 plants]] that rely on (and may benefit from) the natural CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of the environment, although they are less efficient at fixing CO<sub>2</sub> in general.<ref>McKinley, Duncan C., and John M. Blair. \"Woody Plant Encroachment by ''Juniperus virginiana'' in a Mesic Native Grassland Promotes Rapid Carbon and Nitrogen Accrual.\" Ecosystems 11.3 (Apr. 2008): 454-468.</ref>\n\nDamage done by ''J. virginiana'' includes outcompeting forage species in pastureland. The low branches and wide base occupy a significant portion of land area.  The thick foliage blocks out most light, so few plants can live under the canopy. The needles that fall raise the [[Soil pH|pH of the soil]], making it [[alkali]]ne, which holds nutrients such as phosphorus, making it harder for plants to absorb them.  ''Juniperus virginiana'' has been shown to remove [[nitrogen]] from the soil after invading prairies.<ref>Norris, Mark D., John M. Blair, and Loretta C. Johnson. \"Altered Ecosystem Nitrogen Dynamics as a Consequence of Land Cover Change in Tallgrass Prairie.\" American Midland Naturalist 158.2 (Oct. 2007): 432-445.</ref> It has also been found to reduce carbon stores in the soil.  This reduction in soil nutrients also reduces the amount and diversity of microbial activity in the soil.<ref>McKinley, Duncan C., and John M.

It takes about 12 minutes for their seeds to pass through the birds' guts, and seeds that have been consumed by this bird have levels of germination roughly three times higher than those of seeds the birds did not eat.

They thrive under adverse conditions \u2013 both drought tolerant and cold tolerant, they grow well in rocky, sandy, and clay substrates. Competition between trees is minimal, so they can be planted in tightly spaced rows, and the trees still grow to full height, creating a solid windbreak in a short time.<ref>[http://hort.ufl.edu/trees/JUNVIRA.pdf USDA Fact Sheet]</ref>\n\nA number of [[cultivar]]s have been selected for garden planting, including 'Canaertii' (narrow conical; female) 'Corcorcor' (with a dense, erect crown; female), 'Goldspire' (narrow conical with yellow foliage), and 'Kobold' (dwarf). Some cultivars previously listed under this species, notably 'Skyrocket', are actually cultivars of ''J. scopulorum''.<ref>Welch, H., & Haddow, G. (1993). ''The World Checklist of Conifers''. Landsman's. ISBN 0-900513-09-8.</ref>\n\nIn the Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas Ozarks, eastern juniper is commonly used as a [[Christmas tree]].\n\n== Allergen ==\nThe pollen is a known [[allergen]], although not as potent as that of the related ''[[Juniperus ashei]]'' (Ashe juniper), which sheds pollen a month earlier. People allergic to one are usually allergic to both. ''J. virginiana'' sheds pollen as early as late winter and through early spring. Consequently, what begins as an allergy to Ashe juniper in the winter may extend into spring, since the pollination of the eastern juniper follows that of the Ashe juniper.\n\nContact with the leaves or wood can produce a mild skin rash in some individuals.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Cedar wood]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikispecies}}\n* [http://www.pollenlibrary.com/index.php?view=species.php&state=&county=&genus=Juniperus&common=Eastern%20Red-Cedar&species=Juniperus%20virginiana PollenLibrary.com \u2013 Red Cedar distribution map and allergen information]\n* [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_1/juniperus/virginiana.htm USDA Forest Service: Silvics of Trees of North America: ''Juniperus virginiana'']<!--\nRef: {{Silvics |volume=1 |genus=Juniperus |species=virginiana |first=Edwin R. |last=Lawson }} -->\n\n*[http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/juniperus-virginiana-eastern-redcedar-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map of ''Juniperus virginiana'']\n{{Commons category|position=left}}\n\n\n{{Cupressaceae}}\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Juniperus|virginiana]]\n[[Category:Dioecious plants]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Plains-Midwest (United States)]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Plants used in bonsai]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

The lighter brown cones are from the current season; the darker brown cones are mature cones from previous seasons.]]\nTamaracks are very cold tolerant, able to survive temperatures down to at least {{convert|-65|C|F|0}}, and commonly occurs at the [[Arctic]] [[tree line]] at the edge of the [[tundra]]. Trees in these severe climatic conditions are smaller than farther south, often only {{convert|5|m|ft|round=5|abbr=on}} tall. They can tolerate a wide range of soil conditions but grow most commonly in [[swamp]]s, [[bog]]s, or [[muskeg]] in wet to moist organic soils such as [[sphagnum]] [[peat]] and woody peat. They are also found on mineral soils that range from heavy clay to coarse sand; thus texture does not seem to be limiting. Although tamarack can grow well on [[calcareous]] soils, it is not abundant on the [[limestone]] areas of eastern [[Ontario]].\n\n[[File:2015-08-20 17 12 36 Tamarack seedling in a sphagnum bog adjacent to Taborton Road (Rensselaer County Route 42) in Sand Lake, New York.jpg|thumb|upright|Tamarack sapling in a sphagnum bog]]\nTamarack is commonly an early invader.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=44751 |title = Black Spruce |first = C. Michael |last = Hogan |work = GlobalTwitcher.com |date = November 24, 2008 |accessdate = 2011-05-28}}</ref> Tamarack is generally the first forest tree to invade filled-lake bogs. In the lake states, tamarack may appear first in the [[sedge mat]], sphagnum moss, or not until the bog shrub stage. Farther north, it is the pioneer tree in the bog shrub stage. Tamarack is fairly well adapted to reproduce successfully on burns, so it is one of the common [[pioneer species|pioneers]] on sites in the boreal forest immediately after a fire.\n\nThe central [[Alaska]]n population, separated from the eastern [[Yukon]] populations by a gap of about {{convert|700|km|mi}}, is treated as a distinct variety ''Larix laricina'' var. ''alaskensis'' by some botanists, though others argue that it is not sufficiently distinct to be distinguished.\n\n== Associated forest cover ==\n[[File:Tamarack.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Young tree with fall colors]]\nTamarack forms extensive pure stands in the [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] region of [[Canada]] and in northern [[Minnesota]]. In the rest of its [[United States]] range and in the [[Maritime Provinces]], tamarack is found locally in both pure and mixed stands. It is a major component in the [[Society of American Foresters]] (SAF) [[forest cover type]]s Tamarack and [[black spruce\u2013tamarack]].\n\n[[Black spruce]] (''Picea mariana'') is usually tamarack's main associate in mixed stands on all sites. The other most common associates include [[balsam fir]] (''Abies balsamea''), [[white spruce]] (''Picea glauca''), and [[quaking aspen]] (''Populus tremuloides'') in the boreal region. In the better organic soil sites in the northern forest region, the most common associates are the [[northern white-cedar]] (''Thuja occidentalis''), balsam fir, [[Fraxinus nigra|black ash]] (''Fraxinus nigra''), and [[red maple]] (''Acer rubrum''). In [[Alaska]], quaking aspen and tamarack are almost never found together. Additional common associates are [[American elm]] (''Ulmus americana''), [[balsam poplar]] (''Populus balsamifera''), [[jack pine]] (''Pinus banksiana''), [[paper birch]] (''Betula papyrifera''), [[Kenai birch]] (''B. papyrifera'' var. ''kenaica''), and [[yellow birch]] (''B. alleghaniensis'').\n\nTamarack stands cast light shade and so usually have a dense undergrowth of shrubs and herbs. Because the tree has an extensive range, a great variety of shrubs is associated with it. Dominant tall shrubs include [[American dwarf birch|dwarf]] and [[swamp birch]] (''Betula glandulosa'' and ''Betula pumila''), [[willow]]s (''Salix'' spp.), [[speckled alder]] (''Alnus rugosa''), and [[red-osier dogwood]] (''Cornus stolonifera''). Low shrubs include [[bog Labrador tea]] (''Ledum groenlandicum''), [[bog-rosemary]] (''Andromeda glaucophylla''), [[leather leaf]] (''Chamaedaphne calyculata''), and [[small cranberry]] (''Vaccinium oxycoccos''). Characteristically the herbaceous cover includes [[Carex|sedges]] ''(Carex'' spp.), [[cottongrass]] ''(Eriophorum'' spp.), [[three-leaved false Solomonseal]] (''Maianthemum trifolium''), [[marsh cinquefoil]] (''Potentilla palustris''), [[Caltha palustris|marsh-marigold]] (''Caltha palustris''), and [[bogbean]] (''Menyanthes trifoliata''). Ground cover is usually composed of [[sphagnum moss]] ''([[Sphagnum]]'' spp.) and other mosses.\n\n== Flowering and fruiting ==\nTamarack is [[monoecious]].  Male and female flowers are small, either solitary or in groups of 2 or 3, and appear with the needles. Male flowers are yellow and are borne mainly on 1- or 2-year-old branchlets. Female flowers resemble tiny roses.  They are reddish/maroon, have needles at their base which are shorter and bluer than the other needles on the tree.  They are borne most commonly on 2 to 4-year-old branchlets, but may also appear on branchlets 5 or more years old. Cones usually are produced on young growth of vigorous trees. On open-grown trees, cones are borne on all parts of the crown. Ripe cones are brown, oblong-ovoid, and 13 to 19&nbsp;mm (\u00bd to \u00be in) long.\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Larix laricina bonsai by Nick Lenz.jpg|thumb|upright|''Larix laricina'' bonsai]]\nThe [[wood]] is tough and durable, but also flexible in thin strips, and was used by the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] people for making [[snowshoe]]s and other products where toughness was required. The natural crooks located in the stumps and roots are also preferred for creating [[Knee (construction)|knees]] in wooden boats. Currently, the wood is used principally for [[pulpwood]], but also for posts, poles, rough lumber, and fuelwood; Not a major commercial timber species.<ref name=FEIS>{{cite web |title=Larix laricina |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/larlar/all.html |last=Uchytil |first=Ronald J. |year=1991 |publisher=US Forest Service |work=[http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/ Fire Effects Information System]}}</ref>\n\nIt is also grown as an [[ornamental tree]] in gardens in cold regions.

Tamarack trees were used before 1917 in [[Alberta]] to mark the northeast corner of sections surveyed within townships. They were used by the surveyors because at that time the very rot-resistant wood was readily available in the bush and was light to carry.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Their rot resistance was also why they were often used in early water distribution systems.\n\nThe aboriginal peoples of Canada's northwest regions used the inner bark as a poultice to treat cuts, infected wounds, [[frostbite]], boils and hemorrhoids.  The outer bark and roots are also said to have been used with another plant as a treatment for [[arthritis]], cold and general aches and pains.<ref>{{cite book |title=Aboriginal Plant Use in Canada's Northwest Boreal Forest |first=Robin James |last=Marles |publisher=Canadian Forest Service |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-660-19869-9 |page=<!--missing-->}}</ref>\n\nWildlife use the tree for food and nesting. Porcupines eat the inner bark, snowshoe hares feeds on tamarack seedlings, and red squirrels eat the seeds.<ref>{{Silvics |volume=1 |genus=Larix |species=laricina |first=William F. |last=Johnston|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}</ref> Birds that frequent tamaracks during the summer include the white-throated sparrow, song sparrow, veery, common yellow throat, and Nashville warbler.<ref>Dawson, Deanna K. 1979.

North Central Forest Experiment Station, St. Paul, MN.</ref>\n\n== Reaction to competition ==\nTamarack is very intolerant of shade. Although it can tolerate some shade during the first several years, it must become dominant to survive. When mixed with other species, it must be in the over story. The tree is a good self-pruner, and boles of 25- to 30-year-old trees may be clear for one-half or two-thirds their length.\n\nBecause tamarack is very shade-intolerant, it does not become established in its own shade. Consequently, the more tolerant black spruce eventually succeeds tamarack on poor bog sites, whereas northern white-cedar, balsam fir, and swamp hardwoods succeed tamarack on good swamp sites. Recurring [[sawfly]] outbreaks throughout the range of tamarack have probably speeded the usual succession to black spruce or other associates.\n\nVarious tests on planting and natural reproduction indicate that competing vegetation hinders tamarack establishment.\n\nThe shade-intolerance of tamarack dictates the use of even-aged management. Some adaptation of clear cutting or seed-tree cutting is generally considered the best [[silvicultural]] system because tamarack seeds apparently germinate better in the open, and the seedlings require practically full light to survive and grow well. Tamarack is also usually wind-firm enough for the seed-tree system to succeed. Satisfactory reestablishment of tamarack, however, often requires some kind of site preparation, such as slash disposal and [[herbicide]] spraying.\n\n== Damaging agents ==\nThe tamarack has thin bark and is therefore highly susceptible to fire damage, except perhaps in older, upland stands. However, the habitat of tamarack, especially south of the [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] forest, is normally wet enough to protect the tree from fire. The tamarack is also susceptible to high winds. Strong winds can uproot large tamarack trees growing in swamps or other wet-land sites where rooting is shallow. It has also been discovered that abnormally high water levels often kill tamarack stands. Those that survive under such conditions usually grow very slowly. Other effects of high water include dieback and the development of adventitious roots and shoots. Wetland road crossings and beaver damming are the primary causes of flooding.\n\nMany insect species are known to be destructive to tamaracks. The [[larch sawfly]] is the most destructive. Epidemics occur periodically across [[Canada]] and the northern [[United States]] and have caused tremendous losses of merchantable tamarack throughout most of the tree's range. Indications are that radial increment declines markedly after 4 to 6 years of outbreak. After 6 to 9 years of moderate to heavy defoliation, the trees die. In southeastern [[Manitoba]] and northern [[Minnesota]], however, imported parasites of the sawfly have become established and should reduce the frequency and duration of future outbreaks. Another serious defoliator is the [[larch casebearer]] ''[[Coleophora laricella]]''. The [[larch casebearer]] attacks tamarack of all ages, and several severe outbreaks have caused extensive mortality in some areas. Outbreak severity has lessened in recent years, however, probably due to imported parasites of the casebearer that have become widely established.\n\nOnly a few other insects and related organisms (such as [[mites]]) that feed on tamarack are known to sometimes cause serious injury. During an outbreak, the [[spruce budworm]] (''[[Choristoneura fumiferana]]'') can severely damage tamarack. The [[larch-bud moth]] (''[[Zeiraphera improbana]]'') has had occasional short epidemics, and the [[spruce spider mite]] (''[[Oligonychus ununguis]]'') is occasionally found in large numbers on tamarack. The [[Argyresthia laricella|larch-shoot moth]] ''([[Argyresthia laricella]])'' is widely distributed, but serious injury is unusual. One of the most common bark beetles attacking tamarack is the [[eastern larch beetle]] (''[[Dendroctonus simplex]]''), but it feeds mainly on weakened, dying, or dead trees.\n\nTamarack is a host to many pathogens, but only one cause diseases serious enough to have an economic impact on its culture, the ''[[Lachnellula willkommii]]'' fungus. It is a relatively new pathogen in Canada, first recorded in 1980 and originating in Europe. The fungus cause large [[canker]]s to form and a disease known as [[Larch#Diseases|Larch Canker]] which is particularly harmful to the tamarack larch, killing both young and mature trees.<ref>[http://www.exoticpests.gc.ca/es-details/disease/1000096 European larch canker] Natural Resources Canada</ref> Apart from this, the only common foliage diseases are rusts, such as the leaf rust in eastern and central North America. However, this rust, caused by the fungus ''[[Melampsora medusae]]'', and other rusts do little damage to tamarack. The [[needle-cast fungus]] ''[[Hypodermella laricis]]'' has attacked tamarack in [[Ontario]] and has the potential for local damage.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Larch ball]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n* ''This article incorporates text from the http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/silvics_manual/Volume_1/larix/laricina.htm, freely-licensed as a work of the US Fed.

In Ray's ''Historia Plantarum'' (1686) it is called ''Styrax liquida''. However, the first mention of any use of the amber is described by Juan de Grijalva, the nephew of the Govorner of Cuba, in the year 1517.\nJuan de Grijalva tells of gift exchanges with the Mayas \"who presented them with, among other things, hollow reeds of about a span long filled with dried herbs and sweet-smelling liquid amber which, when lighted in the way shown by the natives, diffused an agreeable odour.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Corti|first1=Count|title=A History of Smoking|date=1931|publisher=George G.

Limber and Cash reported that leaf spots produced by this pathogen on several different genera of forest trees were 2\u20135&nbsp;mm diameter with regular margins. During the summer of 1994 in the Nacogdoches County area of Texas, a prominent leaf spot on Sweet Gum was widespread. Infected leaves had numerous necrotic lesions, each surrounded by a reddish halo. The lesions tended to merge resulting in large areas of dead tissue. Infection and fungal development of ''D.&nbsp;dryina'' were investigated on leaves of sweet gum using a combination of microscopic techniques. ''D.&nbsp;dryina'' infection on Sweet Gum has been associated with the disease red leaf spot. Results of this investigation indicate that ''D.&nbsp;dryina'' can penetrate leaf tissue directly, thus having the ability to initiate infection on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. In other regions of the U.S., Sweet Gum populations may not be as susceptible to local populations of this fungus. Environmental stress factors may also be involved, as reports have indicated that herbicide application and [[chlorosis]] caused by iron deficiency may increase susceptibility of ''[[Dicarpella dryina]]''. [[Tannin]]s (a type of biomolecule found in trees to protect it from fire, insects, and bacteria) have been reported to occur in healthy tissue of a variety of plants including sweet gum. They may prevent pathogen invasion by inhibiting fungal enzyme activity. Although cells of healthy sweet gum tissue appear rich in tannins, these materials apparently were not effective in preventing fungal colonization by ''D.&nbsp;dryina''.<ref name=Taylor>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Josephine|author2=Shane Clark |title=Infection and Fungal Development of ''Dicarpella dryina'' on Sweet Gum (''Liquidambar styraciflua'')|journal=Mycologia|date=July\u2013August 1996|volume=88|series=Search Wise|issue=4|pages=613\u2013618|<!-- accessdate=17 September 2012 -->|doi=10.2307/3761156}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n* {{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Liquidambar |species=styraciflua }}\n* {{eFloras|1|220007687|Liquidambar styraciflua}}\n{{1728}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|Liquidambar styraciflua}}{{wikispecies}}\n* {{PLANTS |symbol=LIQUI |name=Liquidambar styraciflua}}\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/liquidambar-styraciflua-sweetgum-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map for ''Liquidambar styraciflua'']\n* [http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Liquidambar+styraciflua University of Michigan - Dearborn: Native American Ethnobotany of  ''Liquidambar styraciflua'']\n* [http://esp.cr.usgs.gov/data/atlas/little/liqustyr.pdf USGS Species Distribution Maps: ''Liquidambar styraciflua''] (pdf file).\n* [http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/list2.htm Bioimages.vanderbilt.edu: ''Liquidambar styraciflua'' images]\n* [http://landscaping.about.com/od/fallfoliagetrees/p/sweetgum_trees.htm Landscaping.about.com: American Sweetgum Trees]\n* {{IUCN2006|assessor=Americas Regional Workshop (Conservation|assessor2=Sustainable Management of Trees, Costa Rica, November 1996)|last-assessor-amp=yes|year=1998|id=33966|title=Liquidambar styraciflua|downloaded=12 May 2006}}\n <!-- Most of Florida, as opposed to the continental trees of \"Trees of Northern Florida\" -->\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Altingiaceae]]\n[[Category:Trees of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Southern Mexico]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of Belize]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guatemala]]\n[[Category:Trees of Honduras]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nicaragua]]\n[[Category:Trees of Chiapas]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Hidalgo (state)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puebla]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Veracruz]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Least concern plants]]\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

Growth is fairly rapid, and the typical form of its head is conical.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book\n  | last =Keeler\n  | first =Harriet L.\n  | title =Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them\n  | publisher =Charles Scriber's Sons\n  | year =1900\n  | location =New York\n  | pages =14\u201319 }}</ref>\n\nThe bark is brown, and furrowed. The branchlets are smooth, and lustrous, initially reddish, maturing to dark gray, and finally brown. Aromatic and bitter.\nThe wood is light yellow to brown, and the sapwood creamy white; light, soft, brittle, close, straight-grained. Specific gravity: 0.4230; density: {{convert|26.36|lb/cuft|g/dm3|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n* Winter buds: Dark red, covered with a bloom, obtuse; scales becoming conspicuous stipules for the unfolding leaf, and persistent until the leaf is fully grown. Flower-bud enclosed in a two-valved, caducous bract.\n[[File:Liriodendron tulipifera tulip close.jpg|thumb|left|''Liriodendron tulipifera'' \"tulip\" flower]]\nThe alternate leaves are simple, pinnately veined, measuring five to six inches long and wide. They have four lobes, and are heart-shaped or truncate or slightly wedge-shaped at base, entire, and the apex cut across at a shallow angle, making the upper part of the leaf look square; midrib and primary veins prominent. They come out of the bud recurved by the bending down of the [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] near the middle bringing the apex of the folded leaf to the base of the bud, light green, when full grown are bright green, smooth and shining above, paler green beneath, with downy veins. In autumn they turn a clear, bright yellow.  [[Petiole (botany)|Petiole]] long, slender, angled.\n[[File:Plodovi Liriodendron tulipifera.jpg|thumb|''Liriodendron tulipifera'' golden autumn leaves and seed cones]]\n* Flowers: May. Perfect, solitary, terminal, greenish yellow, borne on stout [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncles]], an inch and a half to two inches long, cup-shaped, erect, conspicuous. The bud is enclosed in a sheath of two triangular bracts which fall as the blossom opens.\n* Calyx: Sepals three, imbricate in bud, reflexed or spreading, somewhat veined, early deciduous.\n* Corolla: Cup-shaped, petals six, two inches long, in two rows, imbricate, hypogynous, greenish yellow, marked toward the base with yellow. Somewhat fleshy in texture.\n* Stamens: Indefinite, imbricate in many ranks on the base of the receptacle; filaments thread-like, short; anthers extrorse, long, two-celled, adnate; cells opening longitudinally.\n* Pistils: Indefinite, imbricate on the long slender receptacle. Ovary one-celled; style acuminate, flattened; stigma short, one-sided, recurved; ovules two.\n* Fruit: Narrow light brown cone, formed from many [[Samara (fruit)|samaras]] which are dispersed by wind, leaving the axis persistent all winter. September, October.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nA description from ''[[Our native trees and how to identify them]]'' by [[Harriet Louise Keeler]]:<ref name=Keeler />\n{{quote|The leaves are of unusual shape and develop in a most peculiar and characteristic manner. The leaf-buds are composed of scales as is usual, and these scales grow with the growing shoot. In this respect the buds do not differ from those of many other trees, but what is peculiar is that each pair of scales develops so as to form an oval envelope which contains the young leaf and protects it against changing temperatures until it is strong enough to sustain them without injury. When it has reached that stage the bracts separate, the tiny leaf comes out carefully folded along the line of the midrib, opens as it matures, and until it becomes full grown the bracts do duty as stipules, becoming an inch or more in length before they fall. The leaf is unique in shape, its apex is cut off at the end in a way peculiarly its own, the petioles are long, angled, and so poised that the leaves flutter independently, and their glossy surfaces so catch and toss the light that the effect of the foliage as a whole is much brighter than it otherwise would be.\nThe flowers are large, brilliant, and on detached trees numerous. Their color is greenish yellow with dashes of red and orange, and their resemblance to a tulip very marked. They do not droop from the spray but sit erect. The fruit is a cone {{convert|2|to|3|in|cm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} long, made of a great number of thin narrow scales attached to a common axis. These scales are each a carpel surrounded by a thin membranous ring. Each cone contains sixty or seventy of these scales, of which only a few are productive. These fruit cones remain on the tree in varied states of dilapidation throughout the winter.}}\n[[File:Liriodendron-tulipifera-bud.jpg|thumb|''Liriodendron tulipifera'', large gray-green flower bud with yellow bract]] [[File:Liriodendron tulipifera MHNT.BOT.2004.0.jpg|thumb|''Liriodendron tulipifera'' seeds]]\n[[File:Liriodendron tulipifera folded new leaves.jpg|thumb|Tulip tree, unfolding leaves]]\n[[File:Tulip Tree Leaf-vector.svg|thumb|Tulip tree leaf]]\n\n== Distribution ==\nOne of the largest and most valuable hardwoods of eastern North America, it is native from Connecticut and southern New York, westward to southern Ontario and northern Ohio, and south to Louisiana and northern Florida.<ref>\"Tulip tree.\" McGraw-Hill Concise Encyclopedia of Science and Technology. New York:  McGraw-Hill, 2006. Credo Reference. Web. 26 September 2012.</ref> It is found sparingly in New England, it is abundant on the southern shore of Lake Erie and westward to Illinois. It extends south to north Florida, and is rare west of the Mississippi River, but is found occasionally for ornamentals. Its finest development is in the Southern Appalachian mountains, where trees may exceed {{convert|170|ft|m|-1|abbr=on|order=flip}} in height.\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Liriodendron tulipifera columnar trunk.JPG|thumb|Liriodendron columnar trunk in streambank woods, North Carolina]]\n''Liriodendron tulipifera'' is generally considered to be a [[shade tolerance|shade-intolerant]] species that is most commonly associated with the first century of forest [[ecological succession|succession]]. In Appalachian forests, it is a dominant species during the 50\u2013150 years of succession, but is absent or rare in stands of trees 500 years or older. On [[mesic habitat|mesic]], fertile soils, it often forms pure or nearly pure stands.

The seeds typically travel a distance equal to 4\u20135 times the height of the tree, and remain viable for 4\u20137 years. The seeds are not one of the most important food sources for wildlife, but they are eaten by a number of birds and mammals.<ref name=\"silvics\">{{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Liriodendron |species=tulipifera |first=Donald E. |last=Beck |accessdate=2014-04-07}}</ref>\n\nVines, especially [[Vitis|wild grapevines]], are known to be extremely damaging to young trees of this species. Vines are damaging both due to blocking out solar radiation, and increasing weight on limbs which can lead to bending of the trunk and/or breaking of limbs.<ref name=\"silvics\" />\n\n== Taxonomy and naming ==\n[[File:Eiteljorg Museum--'Oonseentia by Gerald Clarke--20 May 2012.JPG|thumb|Tulip tree sign at [[Eiteljorg Museum]], [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], with [[Miami-Illinois language]] name, \"oonseentia\"]]\nOriginally described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], ''Liriodendron tulipifera'' is one of two species (see also ''L.chinense'') in the genus ''[[Liriodendron]]'' in the magnolia family. The name ''Liriodendron'' is Greek for \"lily tree\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nature Ramblings|journal=Science News-Letter|date=12 May 1951|volume=59|issue=19|page=300|doi=10.2307/3928783|jstor=3928783}}</ref> It is also called the tuliptree Magnolia, or sometimes, by the lumber industry, as the tulip poplar or yellow poplar. However, it is not closely related to true [[lilium|lilies]], [[tulips]] or [[populus|poplars]].\n\nThe tulip tree has impressed itself upon popular attention in many ways, and consequently has many common names. The tree's traditional name in the [[Miami-Illinois language]] is \"oonseentia\". Native Americans so habitually made their [[dugout canoe]]s of its trunk that the early settlers west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] called it Canoewood. The color of its wood gives it the name Whitewood. In areas near the [[Mississippi River]] it is called a [[Populus|poplar]] largely because of the fluttering habits of its leaves, in which it resembles trees of that genus. It is sometimes called \"fiddle tree,\" because its peculiar leaves, with their arched bases and in-cut sides, suggest the violin shape.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nature Ramblings|journal=Science News-Letter|date=17 June 1961|volume=79|issue=24|page=384|doi=10.2307/3942819|jstor=3942819}}</ref>  The external resemblance of its flowers to [[tulip]]s named it the Tulip-tree.<ref name=Keeler /> In their internal structure, however, they are quite different. Instead of the triple arrangements of stamens and pistil parts, they have indefinite numbers arranged in spirals.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nature Ramblings|journal=Science News-Letter|date=7 May 1955|volume=67|issue=19|page=302|doi=10.2307/3934969|jstor=3934969}}</ref>\n\n== East Central Florida ecotype ==\nParts of east-central [[Florida]] near [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] have an ecotype with similar-looking leaves to the coastal plain variant of the Carolinas; it flowers much earlier (usually in March, although flowering can begin in late January), with a smaller yellower bloom than other types. This east central Florida ecotype seems to have the best ability to tolerate very wet conditions, where it may grow short pencil-like root structures (pneumatophores) similar to those produced by other swamp trees in warm climates. Superior resistance to drought, pests and wind is also noted. Some individuals retain their leaves all year unless a hard frost strikes. Places where it may be seen include [[Dr. Howard A. Kelly Park]], [[Lake Eola Park]], [[Spring Hammock Preserve]], and\nthe [[University of Central Florida Arboretum]].\n\n== Cultivation and use ==\n''Liriodendron tulipifera'' grows readily from seeds, which should be sown in a fine soft mould, and in a cool and shady situation. If sown in autumn they come up the succeeding spring, but if sown in spring they often remain a year in the ground.  [[John Claudius Loudon|Loudon]] says that seeds from the highest branches of old trees are most likely to germinate. It is readily propagated from cuttings and easily transplanted.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n=== In landscaping ===\n[[File:Willmaturepoplar.jpg|thumb|Mature example of the east central Florida ecotype [[Dr. Howard A. Kelly Park]] near [[Apopka]], [[Florida]].]]\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:ECF Liriodendron.jpg|thumb|Flower of east central Florida ecotype near [[Lake Worth, Florida]]. Flower is smaller and yellower than in most northern upland types.]]  -->\nTulip trees make magnificently shaped specimen trees, and are very large, growing to about {{convert|35|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} in good [[soil]]. They grow best in deep well-drained [[loam]] which has thick dark [[topsoil]]. They show stronger response to [[fertilizer]] compounds (those with low salt index are preferred) than most other trees, but soil structure and organic matter content are more important. In the wild it is occasionally seen around [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] outcrops.<ref>http://www.coacommunity.net/downloads/serpentine08/serpentinegeoecology.pdf</ref> The southeastern coastal plain and east central Florida ecotypes occur in wet but ''not stagnant'' soils which are high in organic matter. All tulip trees are unreliable in clay flats which are subject to ponding and flooding. Like other members of the [[Magnolia]] family, they have fleshy roots that are easily broken if handled roughly. Transplanting should be done in early spring, before leaf-out; this timing is especially important in the more northern areas. Fall planting is often successful in Florida. The east central Florida ecotype may be more easily moved than other strains because its roots grow over nine or ten months every year\u2014several months longer than other ecotypes. Most tulip trees have low tolerance of [[drought]], although Florida natives (especially the east central ecotype) fare better than southeastern coastal plain or northern inland specimens.\n\nIt is recommended as a shade tree.<ref name=Keeler /> The tree's tall and rapid growth is a function of its shade intolerance. Grown in the full sun, the species tends to grow shorter, slower, and rounder, making it adaptable to landscape planting. In forest settings, most investment is made in the trunk (i.e., the branches are weak and easily break off, a sign of axial dominance) and lower branches are lost early as new, higher branches closer to the sun continue the growth spurt upward. A tree just 15 years old may already reach {{convert|40|ft|m|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} in height with no branches within reach of humans standing on the ground.\n\n==== Cultivars ====\n* 'Ardis' \u2013 dwarf, with smaller leaves than wild form.

It is very widely used where a cheap, easy-to-work and stable wood is needed. The [[Heartwood|sapwood]] is usually a creamy off-white color. While the heartwood is usually a pale green, it can take on streaks of red, purple, or even black; depending on the extractives content (i.e. the soil conditions where the tree was grown, etc.). It is clearly the wood of choice for use in [[organ (music)|organs]], due to its ability to take a fine, smooth, precisely cut finish and so to effectively seal against [[organ pipe|pipes]] and [[valve]]s. It is also commonly used for siding clapboards. Its wood may be compared in texture, strength, and softness to [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]].\n\nUsed for interior finish of houses, for siding, for panels of carriages, for coffin boxes, pattern timber, and wooden ware. During scarcity of the better qualities of white pine, tulip wood has taken its place to some extent, particularly when very wide boards are required.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nIt also has a reputation for being resistant to termites, and in the Upland South (and perhaps elsewhere) house and barn sills were often made of tulip poplar beams.\n\n=== Arts ===\nThe tulip tree has been referenced in many poems and the namesakes of other poems, such as [[William Stafford (poet)|William Stafford]]'s \"Tulip Tree.\"<ref>Stafford, William. Stories That Could Be True. New York: Harper & Row, 1977. Print.</ref>\n\nAnother form of art that the tulip tree is a major part of is wood carving. The tulip poplar can be very useful and has been one of the favorite types of trees for wood carving by sculptors such as Wilhelm Schimmel and Shields Landon Jones.<ref>\"SCHIMMEL, WILHELM (1817\u20131890).\" The Encyclopedia of American Folk Art.

The specific epithet ''pomifera'' means \"fruit-bearing\".<ref name=USDA_FS/> The common name ''Osage'' derives from [[Osage Nation|Osage Native Americans]] from whom young plants were first obtained, as told in the notes of Meriwether Lewis in 1804.<ref name=smith/>\n\n== Description ==\n\n===General habit===\nMature trees range from {{convert|40|to(-)|60|ft|m|disp=flip}} tall with short trunks and round-topped canopies. The roots are thick, fleshy, and covered with bright orange bark. The tree's mature bark is dark, deeply furrowed and scaly.\n\nThe wood of ''M. pomifera'' is bright orange-yellow with paler yellow sapwood. The wood is heavy, hard, strong, and flexible, capable of receiving a fine polish and very durable in contact with the ground. It has a [[specific gravity]] of 0.7736, or {{convert|773.6|kg/m3|lb/ft3|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Leaves and branches===\nLeaves are [[leaf arrangement|arranged alternately]] in a slender growing shoot {{convert|3|to(-)|4|ft|cm|-1|disp=flip}} long. In form they are [[simple leaf|simple]], a long oval terminating in a slender point. The leaves are {{convert|3|to(-)|5|in|cm|0|disp=flip}} long and {{convert|2|to(-)|3|in|cm|0|disp=flip}} wide, and are thick, firm, dark green, shining above, and paler green below when full grown. In autumn they turn bright yellow. The [[leaf axil]]s contain formidable spines which when mature are about {{convert|1|in|cm|disp=flip}} long.\n\nBranchlets are at first bright green and pubescent; during their first winter they become light brown tinged with orange, and later they become a paler orange brown. Branches contain a yellow pith, and are armed with stout, straight, axillary spines. During the winter, the branches bear lateral buds that are depressed-globular, partly immersed in the bark, and pale chestnut brown in color.\n\n===Flowers and fruit===\nAs a [[Dioecy#In botany|dioecious]] plant, the inconspicuous [[pistillate]] (female) and [[staminate]] (male) flowers are found on different trees. Staminate flowers are pale green, small, and arranged in [[raceme]]s borne on long, slender, drooping [[peduncle (botany)|peduncle]]s developed from the axils of crowded leaves on the spur-like branchlets of the previous year. They feature a hairy, four-lobed [[sepal|calyx]]; the four stamens are inserted opposite the lobes of calyx, on the margin of a thin disk. Pistillate flowers are borne in a dense spherical many-flowered head which appears on a short stout peduncle from the axils of the current year's growth. Each flower has a hairy four-lobed calyx with thick, concave lobes that invest the ovary and enclose the fruit. [[Ovary (botany)|Ovaries]] are [[Ovary (botany)#Superior ovary|superior]], ovate, compressed, green, and crowned by a long slender [[style (botany)|style]] covered with white stigmatic hairs. The [[ovule]] is solitary.\n\nThe mature multiple fruit's size and general appearance resembles a large, yellow-green [[orange (fruit)|orange]], {{convert|4|to(-)|5|in|cm|disp=flip}} in diameter, with a roughened and tuberculated surface. The compound fruit is a [[syncarp]] of numerous small [[drupe]]s, in which the [[carpel]]s (ovaries) have grown together. Each small drupe is oblong, compressed and rounded; they contain a milky juice which oozes when the fruit is damaged or cut. The seeds are oblong. Although the flowering is dioecious, the pistillate tree when isolated will still bear large oranges, perfect to the sight but lacking the seeds.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book |last=Keeler |first=Harriet L. |title=Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them |url=https://archive.org/stream/ournativetreesa00keelgoog#page/n300/mode/2up |publisher=Charles Scriber's Sons |year=1900 |location=New York |pages=258\u2013262}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nImage:Maclura pomifera 001.JPG|<center>Mature tree\nImage:Maclura pomifera 008.jpg|<center>Mature bark\nImage:Maclura pomifera 002.JPG|<center>Leaves\nImage:Maclura pomifera 003.JPG|<center>Female inflorescence\nImage:Osage orange 1.jpg|<center>Mature multiple fruit\nImage:Osage orange 2.jpg|<center>Multiple fruit, sliced\n</gallery>\n\n== Distribution ==\n[[File:Maclura pomifera range map.png|thumb|right|Natural range of ''M. pomifera'' in pre-Columbian era America.]]\nOsage orange's pre-Columbian range was largely restricted to the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] drainage of [[Oklahoma]], [[Texas]], and [[Arkansas]], as well as the [[Texas blackland prairies|Blackland Prairies]] and [[Oak savanna|Post Oak Savannas]].

One hypothesis is that the Osage orange fruit was eaten by a giant [[ground sloth]] that became extinct shortly after the first human settlement of North America.

It is a large forest [[tree]] of the [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] [[United States]] and [[Southern Ontario]], [[Canada]]. It is a tree that tends to occur singly as scattered specimens, rather than in groves.<ref name=sternberg>Sternberg, G., & Wilson, J. (2004). Native Trees for North American Landscapes. Portland, Oregon:Timber Press</ref>\n\nThe cucumber tree is native primarily within the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] belt, including the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and [[Cumberland Plateau]], up to western [[Pennsylvania]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. There are also numerous disconnected outlying populations through much of the southeastern U.S., and a few small populations in [[Southern Ontario|Southern]] [[Ontario]]. In Canada, the cucumber tree is listed as an [[endangered]] species and is protected under the Canadian [[Species at Risk Act]].<ref name=white>White, D.J. (2000). Update COSEWIC Status Report on the Cucumber Tree ''Magnolia acuminata'' in Canada. Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada.

They are typically small, yellow-green, and borne high in the tree in April through June. The leaves of Magnolia acuminata are pointed at the tip and provide it with its name - 'acuminate' means tapering to a fine point. The name Cucumber Tree refers to the unripe [[fruit]], which is green and often shaped like a small [[cucumber]]; the fruit matures to a dark red color and is 6\u20138&nbsp;cm long and 4&nbsp;cm broad, with the individual carpels splitting open to release the bright red [[seed]]s, 10-60 per fruit. The ripe fruit is a striking reddish orange color.\n\n== Uses and cultivation ==\nCucumber trees are excellent shade trees for [[park]]s and [[garden]]s, though they are not recommended for use as street trees.

It was the first magnolia to be scientifically described under modern rules of botanical [[nomenclature]], and is the type species of the genus ''Magnolia''; as ''Magnolia'' is also the type genus of all [[flowering plant]]s (magnoliophytes), this species in a sense typifies all flowering plants.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Catesby Natural History of Carolina plate 39 Magnolia virginiana and Blue Grosbeak.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mark Catesby]] (1731), ''Natural History of Carolina'' etc., plate 39, with Magnolia lauri folio, subtus albicante, the Sweet Bay (Magnolia virginiana) and ''Coccothraustes coeruleus'', the [[Blue Grosbeak]] (Passerina caerulea).]]\n\n''Magnolia virginiana'' is an [[evergreen]] or [[deciduous]] [[tree]] to 30 m (100 ft) tall, native to the lowlands and swamps of the Atlantic coastal plain of the eastern [[United States]]. The original native range is thought to be from the eastern Gulf Coast to Long Island, New York. Whether it is deciduous or evergreen depends on climate; it is evergreen in areas with milder winters in the south of its range (zone 7 southward), and is semi-evergreen or deciduous further north. The leaves are alternate, simple (not lobed or pinnate), with entire margins, 6-12 cm long, and 3-5 cm wide. The bark is smooth and gray, with the inner bark mildly scented, the scent reminiscent of the [[bay laurel]] spice.\n\nThe flowers are creamy white, 8-14 cm diameter, with 6-15 petal-like [[tepal]]s. The flowers carry a very strong vanilla scent that can sometimes be noticed several hundred yards away.  The fruit is a fused aggregate of follicles, 3-5 cm long, pinkish-red when mature, with the follicles splitting open to release the 1 cm long seeds. The [[seeds]] are black but covered by a thinly fleshy red coat, which is attractive to some [[fruit]]-eating [[bird]]s; these swallow the seeds, digest the red coating, and disperse the seeds in their droppings.\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Magnolia virginiana'' is often grown as an ornamental tree in gardens, and used in horticultural applications to give an architectural feel to landscape designs.  It is an attractive tree for [[park]]s and large [[garden]]s, grown for its large, conspicuous, scented flowers, for its clean, attractive foliage, and for its fast growth. In warmer areas Magnolia virginiana is valued for its evergreen foliage. \n\nThe English botanist and missionary [[John Banister (naturalist)|John Banister]] collected ''Magnolia virginiana'' in the southeastern United States in 1678<!--1688 in Coats--> and sent it to [[England]], where it flowered for [[Henry Compton (bishop) |Bishop Henry Compton]].  This species was the first magnolia to be cultivated in England, although it was soon overshadowed by the evergreen, larger-flowered southern magnolia (''[[Magnolia grandiflora|M. grandiflora]]'')<ref>{{cite book|last=Aitken|first=Richard|title=Botanical Riches: Stories of Botanical Exploration|publisher=Miegunyah Press: State Library of Victoria|location=Melbourne, Victoria|year=2008|pages=112|isbn=9780853319559}}; {{cite book|last=Coats|first=Alice M.|title=Garden Shrubs and Their Histories|publisher= |location= |orig-year=1964|year=1992|pages=''s.v.'' \"Magnolia\"|isbn= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=byLxAAAAMAAJ&q=Garden+Shrubs+and+Their+Histories&dq=Garden+Shrubs+and+Their+Histories}}</ref>  \n\nThe sweetbay magnolia has been hybridized [[horticulture|horticulturally]] with a number of species within [[Magnolia#Subgenus_Magnolia|subgenus Magnolia]].

First recognized for its age and size in 1931, the Mingo Oak was the oldest and largest living white oak tree in the world until its death in 1938.\n\nThe Mingo Oak stood in [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo County]], West Virginia, in a [[Cove (Appalachian Mountains)|cove]] at the base of Trace Mountain near the headwaters of the Trace Fork of Pigeon Creek, a tributary stream of [[Tug Fork]]. The tree reached a height of over {{convert|200|ft|m}}, and its [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] was {{convert|145|ft|m}} in height. Its [[Crown (botany)|crown]] measured {{convert|130|ft|m}} in [[diameter]] and {{convert|60|ft|m}} in height. The tree's trunk measured {{convert|9|ft|10|in|m}} in diameter and the [[circumference]] of its base measured {{convert|30|ft|9|in|m}}. Assessments of its potential board [[lumber]] ranged from {{convert|15000|ft|m}} to {{convert|40000|ft|m}}. Following the tree's [[felling]] in 1938, it was estimated to weigh approximately {{convert|5500|t|LT|disp=flip}}.\n\nWhile the tree had long been known about for its size, the unique status of the Mingo Oak was not recognized until 1931, when John Keadle and Leonard Bradshaw of [[Williamson, West Virginia|Williamson]] took measurements of the tree, and found it to be the largest living white oak in the world. Various estimates place the Mingo Oak's seeding between 1354 and 1361 AD. Using borings from the tree, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] determined that the Mingo Oak was the oldest tree of its species. The Island Creek Coal Company, the North East Lumber Company, and the Cole and Crane Real Estate Trust leased {{convert|1.5|acre|ha}} encompassing the tree to the [[West Virginia Division of Natural Resources|West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission]] for it to be managed as a [[state park]] for the life of the tree. The commission cleared the surrounding land and made improvements such as seating and picnic accommodations for visitors.\n\nBy the spring of 1938, the Mingo Oak failed to produce leaves, and on May of that year, West Virginia state forester D.&nbsp;B. Griffin announced the tree's death. The prevailing theory is that the tree died from the release of poisonous gases and [[sulfur]] fumes from a burning [[spoil tip]] in nearby Trace Gap. The tree was felled with fanfare on September 23, 1938, with transections being sent to the Smithsonian Institution and the West Virginia State Museum. Under the terms of the Island Creek Coal Company's lease with the West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission, the land's lease around the former tree reverted to the company following the tree's felling.\n\n== Geography and setting ==\n[[File:Cumberlandplateaumap.png|upright|thumb|right|A map illustrating the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and the [[Allegheny Mountains|Allegheny]] and

Vanscoy wrote in ''[[Castanea (journal)|Castanea]]'' that the tree was \"almost dead\" due to the release of poisonous gases and [[sulfur]] fumes from a coal [[spoil tip]] of the Island Creek Coal Company, which had been burning nearby in Trace Gap.<ref name = \"BPH1\"/><ref name = \"Vanscoy1\"/><ref name = \"Clarkson1\">{{Harvnb|Clarkson|1964|p=7.}}</ref> In the spring of 1938, the tree failed to produce any leaves.<ref name = \"HHA1\"/><ref name = \"NYT1\"/><ref name = \"Chafin1\"/> White oaks flower in the spring at approximately the same time as their leaves form, between late March and late May.<ref name = \"USFS1\"/> On May 4, 1938, West Virginia's state forester, D.&nbsp;B. Griffin, announced that the Mingo Oak was dead.<ref name = \"Randall1\"/><ref name = \"NYT1\"/> Griffin also noted that a [[fungus]] that only lived on dead or dying trees had been present on the tree for several months prior to its death.<ref name = \"NYT1\"/> The prevailing theory is that the tree died as a result of suffocation from the fumes of the burning pile of coal waste;<ref name = \"BPH1\"/><ref name = \"Vanscoy1\"/><ref name = \"Clarkson1\"/> however, local media initially reported that the tree was killed as a result of fungal growth.<ref name = \"HHA1\"/>\n\n== Felling ==\nIn preparation for the tree's felling, some preliminary cutting was undertaken in the tree's north side in the afternoon hours of September 22. This work was done in order to manipulate the course of the tree's fall, and to estimate the length of time it would take to cut through the remainder of the trunk. After a saw had been worked approximately {{convert|2|ft|m}} into the trunk, it was discovered that the tree was [[decomposition|decomposing]] and open in its center. The lumber crews trimmed the tree's initial cut, and the further work to topple the tree was adjourned until the following morning.<ref name = \"HHA2\"/>\n\nThe tree was felled on September 23 during a ceremony attended by between 2,500 and 3,000 people.<ref name = \"BPH1\"/><ref name = \"HHA1\"/><ref name = \"Chafin1\"/> Among those in attendance were state forester D.&nbsp;B. Griffin, the president of the Island Creek Coal Company, E.&nbsp;P. Rice, and representatives from other companies that had previously owned and leased the land where the tree was located.<ref name = \"BPH1\"/><ref name = \"HHA1\"/><ref name = \"HHA2\"/> In addition to standard cameras photographing the event, two [[movie camera]]s were brought to capture the felling and its associated events. Uniformed West Virginia Game, Fish, and Forestry Commission officers, Mingo County sheriffs' deputies, and other law enforcement personnel were also on hand to provide security and direct traffic.<ref name = \"HHA2\"/>\n\nTwo lumberman were brought in to facilitate the cutting and toppling of the tree: Paul Criss of Charleston and Ed Meek of [[Indianapolis]].<ref name = \"HHA2\"/><ref name = \"RE1\">{{cite news| last = | first =  | author-link =| title =Largest White Oak Tree to Be Cut Down | newspaper =Reading Eagle | publication-place = [[Reading, Pennsylvania]] | volume = | issue = | date = September 23, 1938 | page = 14 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=phkxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=luEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2394%2C4369147 | accessdate = October 6, 2015| via = [[Google News Archive]]}}</ref> Criss brought with him a team of [[Woodchopping|woodchopper]]s and [[Sawyer (occupation)|sawyer]]s representing the Kelly Ax and Tool Works Company.<ref name = \"HHA2\"/><ref name = \"SGM1\"/> Criss was a [[public relations]] spokesperson for the Kelly Ax and Tool Works Company.<ref name = \"SGM1\"/> Meek arrived with his own crew from the E.&nbsp;C. Atkins and Company, a [[saw]] manufacturer. Griffin also enlisted the assistance of a crew of [[game warden]]s and [[Park ranger|ranger]]s. A nearby [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] camp also provided a team to assist in the felling and dismemberment of the tree. The E.&nbsp;C. Atkins and Company also brought a {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}} saw. Most of the readily available [[crosscut saw]]s measured {{convert|6|ft|m}} in length, thus rendering them ineffective at cutting through the tree's wide trunk, which measured over {{convert|6|ft|m}} in diameter {{convert|3|ft|m}} from the ground.<ref name = \"HHA2\"/>\n\nPrior to the tree's cutting, Criss shaved Meek's face with his [[axe]]. He lathered Meek's face and neck and moved his axe blade over Meek's bristles, drawing blood at his chin line. Criss commented: \"That's the trouble with having a lot of officials around. I've shaved a thousand men with that axe and that's the first time I ever drew blood. These officials get me a little nervous.\"<ref name = \"HHA2\"/>\n\nBy 09:00, hundreds of people had arrived to observe the tree's toppling. At 10:00, the final cutting commenced. Criss decided to topple the tree downhill onto a ledge, which narrowed between the two ravines that emptied into Trace Fork. While it was assessed that the shelf was not long enough for the tree to land on, it was agreed upon by all the participants that given the rotten nature of the tree's top section, it would fracture notwithstanding the orientation of its fall. Prior to Criss cutting further into the tree, he assured the crews: \"I can put her anywhere you want her gentlemen. Lay a [[United States ten-dollar bill|$10 bill]] anywhere you like and I'll guarantee the trunk will cover it.\"<ref name = \"HHA2\"/>\n\nThe cutting of the tree began when the {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}} saw, operated by six men, was positioned across the trunk. The saw penetrated the trunk, and the adjacent area was cleared of bystanders. The spectators were repositioned up the hillside to the south and across the ravine to land that had previously been cleared by the Civilian Conservation Corps camp. The men moved the saw backward and forward, as woodchoppers widened the open wedge. After approximately 30 minutes, Criss yelled, \"We're through boys.\"<ref name = \"HHA2\"/> The men removed the saw, and the woodchoppers continued to pick at the open wedge. The tree made a crackling sound, its upper limbs dipped, and the Mingo Oak crashed onto its designated felling location.<ref name = \"HHA2\"/> While it had been intended that the tree be down by 10:30, it was not until 11:00 that this occurred.<ref name = \"Chafin1\"/> To assist in the segmentation of the collapsed tree, competitions were held in woodchopping and log sawing. Saw manufacturer E.&nbsp;C. Atkins and Company furnished saws for the competitors.<ref name = \"HHA1\"/>\n\nBecause of the tree's advanced decomposition within the center of its base, the trunk's lowest {{convert|24|ft|m}} were assessed to be worthless; however, {{convert|66|ft|m}} of the trunk was salvaged in one entire piece. Another cutting yielded a {{convert|40|ft|m|adj=on}} log in length, that averaged {{convert|54|in|cm}} in diameter. The Island Creek Coal Company sent the {{convert|66|ft|m|adj=on}} log to the [[Meadow River Lumber Company]] plant in [[Rainelle, West Virginia|Rainelle]], which had the largest [[Miter saw|cutoff saw]] in the Eastern United States. From this log, transections were cut, and other divisions of it produced lumber, tabletops, and novelty items.<ref name = \"HHA2\"/> Various segments of the tree were cut and given to the West Virginia State Museum and the Smithsonian Institution.<ref name = \"BPH1\"/><ref name = \"Chafin1\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:MingoOak1.jpg|thumb|upright|Cross section of the Mingo Oak's trunk on display at [[West Virginia University]]|alt=Cross section of an oak tree's trunk on display]]\nThe Mingo Oak was the largest living white oak;<ref name = \"Core1\"/><ref name = \"Vanscoy1\"/><ref name = \"Lamb1\">{{Harvnb|Lamb|1939|p=153.}}</ref> and with the exception of the state's [[Gaylussacia brachycera|box huckleberries]] (''Gaylussacia brachycera''), it was the oldest living flora specimen in West Virginia.<ref name = \"Core1\"/><ref name = \"BPH1\"/><ref name = \"Vanscoy1\"/> The tree was referred to as the \"mighty monarch of the mountains\".<ref name = \"BPH1\"/> Biologist Earl M.

The name \"tupelo\" is used primarily in the [[Southern United States|American South]]; northward and in [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachia]], the tree is more commonly called the '''black gum''' or the '''sour gum''', although no part of the plant is particularly gummy.<ref name=Werthner /> Both of these names contrast it with a different tree species with a broadly overlapping range, the [[Liquidambar styraciflua|sweet gum ''(Liquidambar styraciflua)'']], which does produce an aromatic resin.<ref name=Werthner />  Another common name used occasionally in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] is ''pepperidge.''<ref name=Werthner />\n\nOn [[Martha's Vineyard]], in [[Massachusetts]], this species is called \"beetlebung\", perhaps for its use in making the mallet known as a beetle, used for hammering [[bung]]s (stoppers) into barrels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://extension.psu.edu/natural-resources/forests/news/2014/why-do-they-call-it-a-gum-tree| author=Paxton, William C. |date=2014|title=Why Do They Call It a Gum Tree?|publisher=Penn State Extension|accessdate=2014-09-14}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n<!---Overlapping parallel descriptions text should be integrated--->\n[[Image:Nyssa sylvatica JPG1b.jpg|right|thumb|''Nyssa sylvatica'' leaves in the autumn.]]\n[[File:NyssaSylvaticaTrunk.jpg|thumb|right|Trunk of a mature ''Nyssa sylvatica'' tree]]\n''Nyssa sylvatica'' grows to {{convert|20|-|25|m|ft}} tall, rarely to {{convert|35|m|ft}}, with a trunk diameter of {{convert|50|-|100|cm|in}}, rarely up to {{convert|170|cm|in}}. These trees typically have a straight trunk with the branches extending outward at right angles.<ref name=Werthner />  The [[bark]] is dark gray and flaky when young, but it becomes furrowed with age, resembling [[alligator]] hide on very old stems. The twigs of this tree are reddish-brown, usually hidden by a greyish skin. The pith is chambered with greenish partitions.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] of this species are variable in size and shape. They can be oval, elliptical, or obovate, and {{convert|5|\u2013|12|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long. They have lustrous upper surfaces, with entire, often wavy margins. The foliage turns purple in autumn, eventually becoming an intense bright scarlet. Deer are extremely fond of the leaves on seedlings and saplings, to the point where large populations of them can make establishment of the tree almost impossible. For comparison, mature trees are largely left alone.\n\nThe [[flower]]s are very small, in greenish-white in clusters at the top of a long stalk and a rich source or nectar for bees. They are often [[dioecious]] so a male and female tree in proximity is required to set seed, however, many trees are also [[Polygamo-dioecious#Polygamous|polygamo-dioecious]], which means they have both male and female flowers on the same tree. The [[fruit]] is a black-blue, ovoid stone fruit, about 10&nbsp;mm long with a thin, oily, bitter-to-sour tasting flesh and very popular with small bird species. There are from one to three fruits together on a long slender stalk. They are a valuable energy food for birds, especially the [[American robin]].\n\n''Nyssa sylvatica'' forms a large deep taproot when young that makes transplanting difficult. Because of this, it is fairly uncommon in cultivation and the nursery trade.\n\nAdditional characteristics include:\n* Bark: Light reddish brown, deeply furrowed and scaly. Branchlets at first pale green to orange, sometimes smooth, often downy, later dark brown.\n* Wood: Pale yellow, sapwood white; heavy, strong, very tough, hard to split, not durable in contact with the soil. Used for turnery. Sp. gr., 0.6353; weight of cu. ft., 39.59.\n* Winter buds: Dark red, obtuse, one-fourth of an inch long. Inner scales enlarge with the growing shoot, becoming red before they fall.\n* Leaves: Alternate, often crowded at the end of the lateral branches, simple, linear, oblong to oval, two to five inches (127&nbsp;mm)  long, one-half to three inches (76&nbsp;mm)  broad, wedge-shaped or rounded at base, entire, with margin slightly thickened, acute or acuminate. They come out of the bud conduplicate, coated beneath with rusty tomentum, when full grown are thick, dark green, very shining above, pale and often hairy beneath. Feather-veined, midrib and primary veins prominent beneath. In autumn they turn bright scarlet, or yellow and scarlet. Petioles one-quarter to one-half an inch long, slender or stout, terete or margined, often red.\n* Flowers: May, June, when leaves are half grown. Polygamodi\u0153cious, yellowish green, borne on slender downy peduncles. Staminate in many-flowered heads; pistillate in two to several flowered clusters.\n* Calyx: Cup-shaped, five-toothed.\n* Corolla: Petals five, imbricate in bud, yellow green, ovate, thick, slightly spreading, inserted on the margin of the conspicuous disk.\n* Stamens: Five to twelve. In staminate flowers exserted, in pistillate short, often wanting.\n* Pistil: Ovary inferior, one to two-celled; style stout, exserted, reflexed above the middle. Entirely wanting in sterile flower. Ovules, one in each cell.\n* Fruit: Fleshy drupe, one to three from each flower cluster. Ovoid, two-thirds of an inch long, dark blue, acid. Stone more or less ridged.

Its flowers are an important source of [[honey]] and its [[fruit]]s are important to many [[bird]] species. Hollow trunks provide nesting or denning opportunities for [[bee]]s and various [[mammals]]. It is the longest living non-clonal flowering plant in Eastern North America, capable of obtaining ages of over 650 years.<ref>http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~adk/oldlisteast/#spp Eastern OLDLIST</ref>\n\n===Habitats===\n''Nyssa sylvatica'' is found in a wide range of climates, due to its extensive distribution. It commonly grows in both the creek bottoms of the southern coastal plains, to altitudes of about {{convert|900|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in the [[Appalachian Mountains|Southern Appalachians]].<!---Elevation range in Mexico?--->  These trees grow best on well-drained, light-textured soils on the low ridges of second bottoms and on the high flats of silty alluvium. In the uplands it grows best on the loams and clay loams of lower slopes and coves.\n\nThe species occurs 35 different forest cover types.<ref name=\"Black Tupelo\"/> When found on drier upper slopes and ridges, it is seldom of log size or quality.<ref name=\"Black Tupelo\"/><!---But of log size in richer habitats?--->\n\n===Wildlife===\n[[Image:Nyssa sylvatica with mature fruit.jpg|right|thumb|''Nyssa sylvatica'' with mature fruit, starting to show fall coloring]]\n''Nyssa sylvatica'' is an important food source for many migrating birds in the fall. Its early color change ([[foliar fruit flagging]]) is thought to attract birds to the available fruit, which ripen before many other fall fruits and berries. The fruit is quite marked, dark blue, in clusters of two or three. The sour fruits are eagerly sought by many kinds of birds, including: [[American robin]], [[Swainson's thrush]], [[gray-cheeked thrush]], [[hermit thrush]], [[wood thrush]], [[northern cardinal]], [[northern mockingbird]], [[blue jay]], [[red-bellied woodpecker]], [[yellow-bellied sapsucker]], [[northern flicker]], [[pileated woodpecker]], [[eastern phoebe]], [[brown thrasher]], [[eastern bluebird]], [[European starling]], [[scarlet tanager]], [[gray catbird]], [[cedar waxwing]], and [[American crow]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} all primarily eastern North American birds migrating or residing year-round within the tree's range.\n\nThe limbs of these trees often deteriorate early, and the decayed holes make excellent dens for [[squirrel]]s, [[raccoon]]s, [[Virginia opossum]]s, as well as nesting sites for [[honeybee]]s.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:2014-11-02 12 47 05 Black Tupelo during autumn at The College of New Jersey in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|right|thumb|''Nyssa sylvatica'' turning scarlet in autumn]]\n\n===Cultivation===\n''Nyssa sylvatica''  is cultivated as an [[ornamental tree]] in parks and large gardens, where it is often used as a specimen or shade tree. The tree is best when grown in sheltered but not crowded positions, developing a pyramidal shape in youth, and spreading with age. The stem rises to the summit of the tree in one tapering unbroken shaft, the branches come out at right angles to the trunk and either extend horizontally or droop a little, making a long-narrow, cone-like head.\n\nThe leaves are short-petioled and so have little individual motion, but the branches sway as a whole. The spray is fine and abundant and lies horizontally so that the foliage arrangement is not unlike that of the [[beech]] ''(Fagus)''. Its often spectacular autumnal coloring, with intense reds to purples, is highly valued in landscape settings. It is the most fiery and brilliant of the 'brilliant group' that includes [[Acer (genus)|maple]], [[Cornus (plant)|dogwood]], [[sassafras]], and [[Liquidambar|sweet gum]], as well as various species of [[tupelo]].<ref name=Keeler />\n\n===Honey production===\n''Nyssa sylvatica'' is a major source of wild honey in many areas within its range. Hollow sections of black gum trunks were formerly used as [[Beehive|bee gums]] by [[beekeeper]]s.<ref>{{cite book|author=Crane, Ethel Eva|title=The World History of Beekeeping and Honey Hunting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVh3AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA305|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|page=305}}</ref>\n\n===Wood===\nThe wood of ''Nyssa sylvatica'' is heavy, hard, cross-grained, and difficult to split, especially after drying. This resistance to splitting led to its use for making [[mallet|maul]]s, [[pulley]]s, [[wheel|wheel hub]]s, [[roller (agricultural tool)|agricultural roller]]s, [[bowl (vessel)|bowl]]s, and [[road surface|paving blocks]].<ref name=Werthner />  The wood is also used for pallets, rough floors, pulpwood, and firewood. Since the wood is very tough, resistant to wear, it has been used for [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttles]] in weaving.\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Nyssa sylvatica}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n* [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=NYSY USDA Plant Profile - ''Nyssa sylvatica'']\n* {{ThePlantList}}\n* [http://www.fw.vt.edu/dendro/dendrology/syllabus/nsylvatica.htm Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University Source]\n* [http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hcs/TMI/Plantlist/ny_atica.html Ohio State University Source]\n* [http://www.hrt.msu.edu/ash.alt/tupelo.htm Michigan State University Source]\n* [http://www.hort.net/profile/nys/nyssy/ Hort.net profile]\n* [http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/nysy.htm ''Nyssa sylvatica'' images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu]\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/nyssa-sylvatica-black-tupelo-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map for Nyssa sylvatica]\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nyssa Sylvatica}}\n[[Category:Nyssa]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Hidalgo (state)]]\n[[Category:Trees of Puebla]]\n[[Category:Trees of Veracruz]]\n[[Category:Trees of Chiapas]]\n[[Category:Trees of humid continental climate]]\n[[Category:Garden plants of North America]]\n[[Category:Ornamental trees]]",

Occasionally on extremely productive sites, this species can reach heights in excess of 30 meters and 60&nbsp;cm diameter. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternately arranged, [[deciduous]], {{convert|8|\u2013|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4|\u2013|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} broad, with a finely [[serrated]] margin; they are dark green in summer, but turn vivid red in fall. The [[flower]]s are white, bell-shaped, 6\u20139&nbsp;mm ( 1/4 to 1/3&nbsp;inch) long, produced on {{convert|15|\u2013|25|cm|in|abbr=on}} long [[panicle]]s. The [[fruit]] is a small woody [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]]. The [[root]]s are shallow, and the tree grows best when there is little root competition; it also requires [[acid]]ic soils for successful growth. The leaves can be chewed (but should not be swallowed) to help alleviate a dry-feeling mouth.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Sourwood raceme Keeler.png|60px|thumb|[[Raceme]] of flowers]]\nThe bark is gray with a reddish tinge, deeply furrowed and scaly. Branchlets at first are light yellow green, but later turn reddish brown. The wood is reddish brown, with paler [[Wood#Heartwood and sapwood|sapwood]]; it is heavy, hard, and close-grained, and will take a high polish. Its specific gravity is 0.7458, with a density of 46.48&nbsp;lb/cu ft.\n\nThe winter buds are axillary, minute, dark red, and partly immersed in the bark. Inner scales enlarge when spring growth begins.\nLeaves are alternate, four to seven inches long, 1.5 to 2.5&nbsp;inches wide, oblong to ablanceolate, wedge-shaped at the base, serrate, and acute or [[Leaf shape|acuminate]]. Leaf veins are [[Leaf#Venation (arrangement of the veins)|Feather-veined]], the [[midrib]] is conspicuous. They emerge from the bud revolute, bronze green and shining, and smooth; when full grown, they are dark green, shining above, and pale and glaucous below. In autumn, they turn bright scarlet. Petioles are long and slender, with stipules wanting. They are heavily laden with acid.\n\nIn June and July, perfect, cream-white flowers are borne in terminal panicles of secund racemes seven to eight inches long; rachis and short pedicels are downy. The calyx is five-parted and persistent; [[Lobe (anatomy)|lobes]] are [[Aestivation (botany)|valvate]] in bud. The corolla is ovoid-cylindric, narrowed at the throat, cream-white, and five-toothed. The 10 stamens are inserted on the corolla; filaments are wider than the anthers; anthers are two-celled. The pistil is ovary superior, ovoid, and five-celled; the style is columnar; the stigma is simple; the disk is ten-toothed, and ovules are many.\n\nThe fruit is a capsule, downy, five-valved, five-angled, and tipped by the persistent style; the pedicels are curving.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book\n  | last =Keeler\n  | first =Harriet L.\n  | title =Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them\n  | publisher =Charles Scribner's Sons\n  | year =1900\n  | location =New York\n  | pages =192\u2013194 }}</ref>\n\n==Cultivation and uses==\nThe sourwood is perfectly hardy in the north and a worthy [[Ornamental plant#Trees|ornamental tree]] in lawns and parks. Its late bloom makes it desirable, and its autumnal coloring is particularly beautiful and brilliant.

They can be eaten fresh or used in cooking, particularly in sweet desserts. One of the most common desserts with the pecan as a central ingredient is the [[pecan pie]], a traditional [[Cuisine of the Southern United States|Southern U.S. dish]].

Outside the United States, pecans are grown in [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[China]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], and [[South Africa]]. They can be grown from [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] [[hardiness zones]] approximately 5 to 9, provided summers are also hot and humid.\n\nPecan trees may live and bear edible seeds for more than 300 years. They are mostly [[self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatible]], because most [[cultivars]] are clones derived from wild trees which show incomplete [[Sequential hermaphroditism#Flowering plants|dichogamy]]. Generally, two or more trees of different cultivars must be present to pollinate each other.{{clear|left}}\n\nChoosing cultivars can be a complex practice, based on the Alternate Bearing Index (ABI) and their period of pollinating.  Commercial planters are most concerned with the ABI, which describes a cultivar's likelihood to bear on  alternating years (index of 1.0 signifies highest likelihood of bearing little to nothing every other year).<ref name=\"Alternate Bearing Information\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpes.peachnet.edu/pecan/alternate%20bearing.htm |title=University of Georgia Pecan Breeding |publisher=Cpes.peachnet.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>  The period of pollination groups all cultivars into two families: those that shed pollen before they can receive pollen ([[protandrous]]), and those that shed pollen after becoming receptive to pollen ([[protogynous]]).<ref name=\"GROWING PECANS\">\n\nPecans are also grown in the Central Valley of California\nIN ILLINOIS\">{{cite web|url=http://web.extension.uiuc.edu/edwardsvillecenter/downloads/11263.doc |title=William Reid, Nut Crops Extension Specialist, University of Illinois |date= |accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>  Planting cultivars from both families within 250 feet is recommended for proper pollination.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:pecan-nuts-on-tree.jpg|Ripe pecan nuts on tree\nFile:Carya illinoinensis MHNT.BOT.2011.3.85.jpg|''Carya illinoinensis'', [[MHNT]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== Breeding and selection programs ===\nActive breeding and selection programs are carried out by the USDA [[Agricultural Research Service]] with growing locations at [[Brownwood, Texas|Brownwood]] and [[College Station, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://extension-horticulture.tamu.edu/carya/ | publisher=TAMU Horticulture Dept| title=USDA Pecan Breeding Program, National Clonal Germplasm Repository for Pecans and Hickories |accessdate=21 Nov 2014}}</ref> While selection work has been done since the late 1800s, most acreage of pecans grown today is of older cultivars, such as 'Stuart', 'Schley', and 'Desirable', with known flaws but also with known production potential.

Numerous varieties produce well in Texas, but fail in the Southeastern U.S. due to increased disease pressure. Selection programs are ongoing at the state level, with Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kansas, Florida, Missouri, and others having trial plantings.\n\nVarieties adapted from the southern tier of states north through some parts of Iowa and even into southern Canada are available from nurseries. Production potential drops significantly when planted further north than Tennessee. Most breeding efforts for northern-adapted varieties have not been on a large enough scale to significantly affect production. Varieties that are available and adapted (e.g., 'Major', 'Martzahn', 'Witte', 'Greenriver', and 'Posey') in [[Hardiness zone|zones 6]] and farther north are almost entirely selections from wild stands. A northern-adapted variety must be grafted onto a northern rootstock to avoid freeze damage.\n\nThe pecan is a 32-chromosome species, and can hybridize with other 32-chromosome members of the ''Carya'' [[genus]], such as ''[[Carya ovata]]'', ''[[Carya laciniosa]]'', and ''[[Carya cordiformis]]''. Most such hybrids are unproductive, though a few second-generation hybrids have potential for producing hickory-flavored nuts with pecan nut structure. Such hybrids are referred to as \"[[hican]]s\" to indicate their hybrid origin.\n\n=== Diseases ===\n{{Main article|List of pecan diseases}}\nIn the Southeastern United States, [[nickel]] deficiency in ''C. illinoinensis'' produces a disorder called mouse-ear in trees fertilized with urea.<ref name=\"BarkerPilbeam2007\">{{cite book|author1=Allen V.

Symptoms of mouse-ear include rounded or blunt leaflet tips which produces smaller leaflets, dwarfing of tree organs, poorly developed root systems, rosetting, delayed bud break, loss of apical dominance, and necrosis of leaflet tips. Mouse-ear can be treated with foliar sprays of nickel. -->  Similarly, zinc deficiency causes rosetting of the leaves.\n\nPecans are also prone to infection by fungi, especially in humid conditions. [[Ziram]] is a common fungicide used to prevent scab and anthracnose in pecans.\n\n== Nutrition ==\n{{Nutritional value\n|name            = Pecans\n|image           = Pecans-4352.jpg\n|caption         =\n|serving_size    = 100 grams\n|kJ              =2889\n|carbs           = 13.86\n|fat             = 71.97\n|protein         = 9.17\n|sugars          = 3.97\n|lactose         =\n|satfat          = 6.18\n|transfat        =\n|monofat         = 40.801\n|polyfat         = 21.614\n|omega3fat       =\n|omega6fat       =\n|fiber           = 9.6\n|starch          = 0.46\n|water           = 3.52\n|alcohol         =\n|caffeine        =\n|opt1n           =\n|opt1v           =\n|opt4n           =\n|opt4v           =\n|calcium_mg      = 70\n|iron_mg         = 2.53\n|phosphorus_mg   = 277\n|magnesium_mg    = 121\n|manganese_mg    = 4.5\n|sodium_mg       = 0\n|potassium_mg    = 410\n|zinc_mg         = 4.53\n|vitA_ug         =\n|vitA_iu         = 56\n|betacarotene_ug = 29\n|lutein_ug       = 17\n|thiamin_mg      = 0.66\n|riboflavin_mg   = 0.13\n|niacin_mg       = 1.167\n|pantothenic_mg  = 0.863\n|vitB6_mg        = 0.21\n|folate_ug       = 22\n|vitB12_ug       =\n|vitC_mg         = 1.1\n|vitD_ug         = 0\n|vitD_iu         =\n|vitE_mg         = 1.4\n|vitK_ug         = 3.5\n|source          =\n|source_usda     = 1\n|note            = [http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/3711?fg=&man=&lfacet=&count=&max=35&sort=&qlookup=Nuts%2C+pecans&offset=&format=Full&new=&measureby= Link to Full USDA Database Information]\n}}\n\nIn 100 g, pecans provide 691 [[Calories]]<!-- kilocalories or Calories, NOT calories --> and over 100% of the [[Daily Value]] (DV) for total [[fat]].

Juglandaceae are represented worldwide by between seven and 10 extant genera and more than 60 species. Most of these species are concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere of the New World, but some can be found on every continent except for Antarctica. The first fossil examples of the family appear during the [[Cretaceous]]. Differentiation between the subfamilies of [[Engelhardia | Engelhardioideae]] and Juglandioideae occurred during the early [[Paleogene]], about 64 million years ago. Extant examples of Engelhardioideae are generally tropical and evergreen, while those of Juglandioideae are deciduous and found in more temperate zones. The second major step in the development of WGA11126 pecan was a change from wind-dispersed fruits to animal dispersion. This dispersal strategy coincides with the development of a husk around the fruit and a drastic change in the relative concentrations of fatty acids. The ratio of oleic to linoleic acids are inverted between wind- and animal-dispersed seeds.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=2440634 |author=Donald E. Stone|title=New World Juglandaceae. II.

The fruits of the pecan genus ''Carya'' differ from those of the walnut genus ''Juglans'' only in the formation of the husk of the fruit. The husks of walnuts develop from the bracts, bracteoles, and sepals, or sepals only. The husks of pecans develop from the bracts and the bracteoles only.<ref name=\"Paul Manos and Donald E. Stone\" />\n\n== History ==\nBefore European settlement, pecans were widely consumed and traded by Native Americans. As a food source, pecans are a natural choice for preagricultural society. As a wild forage, the fruit of the previous growing season is commonly still edible when found on the ground. Hollow tree trunks, found in abundance in pecan stands, offer ideal storage of pecans by humans and squirrels, alike.<ref name=\"Grant D. Hall\" />\n\nPecans first became known to Europeans in the 16th century. The first Europeans to come into contact with pecans were Spanish explorers in what is now Mexico, Texas, and Louisiana. These Spanish explorers called the pecan, ''nuez de la arruga'', which roughly translates to \"wrinkle nut\". They were called this for their resemblance to wrinkles. The genus ''Carya'' does not exist in the Old World. Because of their familiarity with the genus ''[[Juglans]]'', these early explorers referred to the nuts as ''nogales'' and ''nueces'', the Spanish terms for \"walnut trees\" and \"fruit of the walnut\". They noted the particularly thin shell and acorn-like shape of the fruit, indicating they were indeed referring to pecans.<ref name=\"Grant D. Hall\" /> The Spaniards took the pecan into [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]] beginning in the 16th century. In 1792, [[William Bartram]] reported in his botanical book, ''Travels'', a nut tree, ''Juglans exalata'' that some botanists today argue was the American pecan tree, but others argue was hickory, ''Carya ovata''. Pecan trees are native to the United States, and writing about the pecan tree goes back to the nation's founders. [[Thomas Jefferson]] planted pecan trees, ''C. illinoinensis'' (Illinois nuts), in his nut orchard at his home, Monticello, in Virginia. [[George Washington]] reported in his journal that Thomas Jefferson gave him \"Illinois nuts\", pecans, which Washington then grew at [[Mount Vernon]], his Virginia home.\n\n=== Symbolism ===\nIn 1906, Texas Governor [[James Stephen Hogg]] asked that a pecan tree be planted at his grave instead of a traditional headstone, requesting that the seeds be distributed throughout the state to make Texas a \"Land of Trees\".<ref name=\"Texas Pecan Growers Association\" /> His wish was carried out and this brought more attention to pecan trees. In 1919, the 36th Texas Legislature made the pecan tree the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[Texas]] where the town of [[San Saba, Texas|San Saba]] claims to be \"The Pecan Capital of the World\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sansabatexas.com|title=Town website for San Saba, Texas|publisher=Town of San Saba Texas}}</ref> Several other American towns and regions host annual events celebrating the pecan harvest.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|Carya illinoinensis}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/cail2.htm ''Carya illinoinensis'' images at bioimages.vanderbilt.edu]\n* [http://www.uga.edu/nchfp/publications/nchfp/factsheets/preservingpecans.html National Center for Home Food Preservation\u2014Home Preservation of pecans]\n* [http://www.na.fs.fed.us/Spfo/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_2/carya/illinoesis.htm USDA Forest Service: ''Carya illinoensis'']\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/carya-illinoensis-pecan-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map of ''Carya illinoensis'']\n* {{gutenberg|no=28065|name=The Pecan and its Culture}} (Text from 1906)\n* [http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/camden/first-pecan-trees-grown-here-about-1840 First Pecan Trees Grown Here About 1840] historical marker at [[St. Marys, Georgia]]\n\n{{Nuts}}\n\n[[Category:Carya]]\n[[Category:Crops originating from Mexico]]\n[[Category:Crops originating from the United States]]\n[[Category:Cuisine of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Edible nuts and seeds]]\n[[Category:Georgia (U.S. state) culture]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1787]]\n[[Category:Symbols of Texas]]\n[[Category:Trees of Coahuila]]\n[[Category:Trees of Guanajuato]]\n[[Category:Trees of Jalisco]]\n[[Category:Trees of Nuevo Le\u00f3n]]\n[[Category:Trees of Oaxaca]]\n[[Category:Trees of Tamaulipas]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the South-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of Veracruz]]",

Throughout the greater part of its range, white spruce routinely survives and is undamaged by winter temperatures of {{convert|\u221250|C|F}}, and even lower temperatures occur in parts of the range (Fowells 1965, Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990).<ref name=\"SilvicsNA\" /><ref name=\"fowells\"/> [[Taiga|Boreal]] ''Picea'' are among the few extremely hardy [[Pinophyta|conifers]] in which the bud primordia are able to survive temperatures down to {{convert|-70|C|F|disp=comma}} (Sakai and Larcher 1987).<ref name=\"sakai4\">Sakai, A.; Larcher, W.

Springer-Verlag, New York NY.</ref> First, classical definitions generally connote directional changes in species composition and community structure through time, yet the time frame needed for documentation of change far exceeds an average lifespan (Solomon et al. 1981).<ref name=\"solo\" /> The second feature that defies quantitative description is the end point or climax.\n\nFloodplain deposits in the Northwest Territory, Canada, are important in relation to the development of productive forest types with a component of [[white spruce]] (Jeffrey 1964).<ref name=\"jeff2\"/> The most recently exposed surfaces are occupied by sandbar vegetation or riparian shrub willows and alder (''Alnus incana''); with increasing elevation, the shrubs give way successively to [[Populus balsamifera|balsam poplar]] and white spruce forest. In contrast, older floodplains, with predominantly brown wooded soils, typically carry white spruce\u2013[[Populus tremuloides|trembling aspen]] mixedwood forest.\n\nInterrelationships among nutrient cycling, regeneration, and subsequent forest development on floodplains in interior Alaska were addressed by Van Cleve et al. (1980),<ref name=\"van1\">Van Cleve, K.; Dyrness, R.; Viereck, L. 1980. Nutrient cycling in interior Alaska flood plains. p. 11\u201318 ''in'' Murray, M.; Van Veldhuizen, R.M. (Eds.). Proc.

Thus, each successional stage has a species combination in harmony with site quality. Short-circuiting succession by planting a late successional species such as white spruce on an early successional surface may result in markedly reduced growth rates because of [[Nitrogen deficiency|nitrogen insufficiency]]. Without application of substantial amounts of fertilizer, use would have to be made of early successional alder and its site-ameliorating additions of nitrogen.\n\nNeiland and Viereck noted that \u201cthe slow establishment and growth of spruce under birch stands [in Alaska] may be partially due to effects of shading and general competition for water and nutrients, but may also be more directly related to the [[birch]] itself.

Succession follows in one of two general patterns. In most cases, aspen and birch develop as a successional stage after [[Wildfire|fire]] before reaching the spruce stage. But, occasionally, with optimal site conditions and a source of seed, white spruce will invade with the [[hardwood]]s or within a few years thereafter, thereby producing even-aged white spruce stands without an intervening hardwood stage.\n\n== Associated forest cover ==\nThe White Spruce Cover Type may include other species in small numbers. In Alaska, associates include paper birch, trembling aspen, balsam poplar, and black spruce; in western Canada, additional associates are subalpine fir, balsam fir, Douglas-fir, jack pine, and lodgepole pine (Dyrness 1980).<ref name=\"vier1\">Dyrness, C.T. 1980.

The type shows little variation. The forest is generally closed and the trees well formed, other than those close to the timberline. Lesser vegetation in mature stands is dominated by [[moss]]es. [[Vascular plant]]s are typically few, but [[shrub]]s and [[herb]]s that occur \u201cwith a degree of regularity\u201d include: alder, willows, mountain cranberry, red-fruit bearberry, black crowberry, prickly rose, currant, buffaloberry, blueberry species, bunchberry, twinflower, tall lungwort, northern comandra, horsetail, bluejoint grass, sedge species, as well as ground-dwelling [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s. Several white spruce communities have been identified in interior Alaska: white spruce/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/sphagnum; white spruce/avens/moss; and white spruce/alder/bluejoint (Viereck 1975, Dyrness 1980).<ref>Viereck, L.A. 1975.

Through much of its range it averages {{convert|5|\u2013|15|m|round=5|abbr=on}} tall with a trunk {{convert|15|\u2013|50|cm|0|abbr=on}} diameter at maturity, though occasional specimens can reach {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|60|cm|abbr=on}} diameter. The [[bark]] is thin, scaly, and grayish brown. The [[leaf|leaves]] are needle-like, {{convert|6|\u2013|15|mm|frac=16|abbr=on}} long, stiff, four-sided, dark bluish green on the upper sides, paler [[glaucous]] green below. The [[Conifer cone|cones]] are the smallest of all of the spruces, {{convert|1.5|\u2013|4|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad, spindle-shaped to nearly round, dark purple ripening red-brown, produced in dense clusters in the upper crown, opening at maturity but persisting for several years.<ref name=farjon /><ref name=rushforthc />\n\nNatural [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] occurs regularly with the closely related ''[[Picea rubens]]'' (red spruce), and very rarely with ''[[Picea glauca]]'' (white spruce).<ref name=farjon />\n\nIt differs from ''[[Picea glauca|P. glauca]]'' in having a dense cover of small hairs on the bark of young branch tips, an often darker reddish-brown bark, shorter needles, smaller and rounder cones, and a preference for wetter lowland areas. Numerous differences in details of its needle and [[pollen]] morphology also exist but require careful microscopic examination to detect. From true firs, such as ''[[Abies balsamea]]'' (balsam fir), it differs in having pendulous cones, persistent woody leaf-bases, and four-angled needles, arranged all round the shoots.\n\nDue to the large difference between [[heartwood]] and [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] moisture content, it is easy to distinguish these two wood characteristics in [[ultrasound]] images,<ref name=BlackSpruce>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wei | first1 = Q. | last2 = Chui | first2 = Y.

In swamp and [[muskeg]] it shows progressively slower growth rates from the edges toward the centre. The roots are shallow and wide spreading, resulting in susceptibility to [[windthrow]]. In the northern part of its range, [[ice pruning|ice pruned]] asymmetric black spruce are often seen with diminished foliage on the windward side.<ref>C.

In the [[Great Lakes States]] it is most abundant in peat [[bogs]] and swamps, also on transitional sites between peatlands and uplands. In these areas it is rare on uplands, except in isolated areas of northern [[Minnesota]] and the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]].\n\n[[File:Picea mariana taiga.jpg|thumb|left|Black spruce taiga, Copper River, Alaska.]]\nMost stands are even-aged due to frequent fire intervals in black spruce forests. It commonly grows in pure stands on organic soils and in mixed stands on mineral soils. It is tolerant of nutrient-poor soils, and is commonly found on poorly drained acidic [[peatlands]]. It is considered a [[climax species]] over most of its range; however, some ecologists question whether black spruce forests truly attain climax because fires usually occur at 50 to 150 year intervals, while \"stable\" conditions may not be attained for several hundred years.<ref name=farjon />\n\nThe frequent fire return interval, a natural [[fire ecology]], perpetuates numerous successional communities. Throughout [[Boreal ecosystem|boreal]] [[North America]], ''[[Betula papyrifera]]'' (paper birch) and ''[[Populus tremuloides]]'' (quaking aspen) are successional hardwoods that frequently invade burns in black spruce. Black spruce typically seeds in promptly after fire, and with the continued absence of fire, will eventually dominate the hardwoods.\n\nIt is a pioneer that invades the sedge mat in filled-lake bogs, though often preceded slightly by  ''[[Larix laricina]]'' (tamarack), with which it may in time form a stable forest cover in swamps. However, as the peat soil is gradually elevated by the accumulation of organic matter, and the fertility of the site improves, Balsam Fir and ''[[Thuja occidentalis]]'' (eastern arborvitae) will eventually replace black spruce and tamarack.\n\nThe larvae of the [[spruce budworm]] [[moth]] cause defoliation which will lead to death if it occurs several years in a row, though black spruce is less susceptible than white spruce or balsam fir. Trees most at risk are those growing with balsam fir and white spruce.\n\n== Cultivation ==\nNumerous [[cultivars]] have been selected for use in parks and gardens.  The cultivar ''P. mariana'' 'Nana' is a dwarf form which has gained the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Award of Garden Merit]].<ref name=RHS>{{cite web|title=Picea mariana 'Nana' AGM|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=3823|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society|accessdate=14 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Uses and symbolism ==\nBlack spruce is the [[Provincial tree emblems of Canada|provincial tree]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].\n\nThe timber is of low value due to the small size of the trees, but it is an important source of [[pulpwood]] and the primary source of it in [[Canada]].<ref name=Powers_Coniferous>{{cite book|last=Powers|first=R.F.|title=Coniferous Forests|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam [u.a].|isbn=978-0-444-81627-6|page=271|edition=1st|author2=Adams, M.B. |author3=Joslin, J.D. |author4= Fisk, J.N. |editor=Andersson, F.|chapter=Non-Boreal Coniferous Forests of North America}}</ref>  Fast-food chopsticks are often made from black spruce.<ref name=gd />\n\nHowever, it is increasingly being used for making [[cross laminated timber]] by companies such as Nordic Structures, which allows the high strength due to the tight growth rings to be assembled into larger timbers.<ref name=Chibougamou>{{cite web|title=BLACK SPRUCE'S UNIQUE FIBER|url=http://chibou.com/en/the-resource/black-spruce|website=Chantiers Chibougamou|accessdate=31 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n{{Commons+cat}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{taxonbar}}\n\n[[Category:Least concern flora of the United States]]\n[[Category:Least concern plants]]\n[[Category:Picea|mariana]]\n[[Category:Taiga and boreal forests]]\n[[Category:Trees of Subarctic America]]\n[[Category:Trees of Western Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1768]]\n[[Category:Provincial symbols of Newfoundland and Labrador]]\n[[Category:Trees of continental subarctic climate]]",

This species occasionally hybridizes with other pine species such as loblolly pine (''[[Pinus taeda]]''), shortleaf pine (''[[Pinus echinata]]''), and pond pine (''[[Pinus serotina]]''); the last is treated as a [[subspecies]] of pitch pine by some [[botanist]]s.\n\n==Distribution==\nPitch pine is found mainly in the southern areas of the [[northeastern United States]], from coastal [[Maine]] and [[Ohio]] to [[Kentucky]] and northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. A few stands occur in southern [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]]. This pine occupies a variety of habitats from dry acidic sandy uplands to swampy lowlands, and can survive in very poor conditions; it is the primary tree of the [[Pine Barrens (New Jersey)|New Jersey Pine Barrens]].<ref name=\"Moore2008\">{{cite book |last=Moore |first=Gerry |last2=Kershner |first2=Bruce |display-authors=2 |first3=Craig |last3=Tufts |first4=Daniel |last4=Mathews |first5=Gil |last5=Nelson |last6=Spellenberg |first6=Richard |last7=Thieret |first7=John W. |first8=Terry |last8=Purinton |last9=Block |first9=Andrew |title=National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Trees of North America |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |year=2008 |page=756 |isbn=1-4027-3875-7}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nThe needles are in fascicles of three, about {{convert|6|-|13|cm|abbr=on}} in length, and are stout (over {{convert|1|mm|abbr=on}} broad) and often slightly twisted. The cones are {{convert|4|-|7|cm|abbr=on}} long and oval with prickles on the scales. Pitch pine has an exceptionally high regenerative ability; if the main trunk is cut or damaged by fire it can re-sprout using [[epicormic shoots]]. This is one of its many adaptations to fire, which also includes a thick bark to protect the sensitive [[Cork cambium|cambium layer]] from heat. Burnt trees often form stunted, twisted trees with multiple trunks as a result of the resprouting. This characteristic also makes it a popular species for [[bonsai]].\n\nPitch pine is rapid-growing when young, gaining around one foot of height per year under optimal conditions until the tree is 50\u201360 years old, whereupon growth slows. By 90 years of age, the amount of annual height gain is minimal. Open-growth trees begin bearing cones in as little as three years, with shade-inhabiting pines taking a few years longer. Cones take two years to mature and seed dispersal occurs over the fall and winter and trees cannot self-pollinate. The total lifespan of pitch pine is about 200 years.\n\n==Uses==\nPitch pine is not a major timber tree due to the frequency of multiple or crooked trunks; nor is it as fast-growing as other eastern American pines. However, it grows well on unfavorable sites. In the past, it was a major source of [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and timber for ship building, mine timbers, and railroad ties because the wood's high resin content preserves it from decay. Pitch pine wood was also used for building radio towers in Germany, as at [[transmitter Muehlacker|Muehlacker]] and [[transmitter Ismaning|Ismaning]].\n\nPitch pine is currently used mainly for rough construction, pulp, crating, and fuel. However, due to its uneven growth, quantities of high quality can be very sought after, and large lengths of pitch pine can be very costly.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:2013-05-10 09 02 57 Pitch Pine new growth and pollen cones along the Batona Trail in Brendan T.

It prefers well-drained or sandy soils and humid climates, but can also grow in boggy areas and rocky highlands. In mixed forests, this dominant tree towers over many others, including some of the large broadleaf hardwoods. It provides food and shelter for numerous forest birds, such as the [[red crossbill]], and small mammals such as [[squirrel]]s.\n\nEastern White Pine forests originally covered much of north-central and north-eastern North America. Only one percent of the [[old-growth forest]]s remain after the extensive logging operations of the 18th century to early 20th century.\n\nOld growth forests, or virgin stands, are protected in [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. Other protected areas with known virgin forests, as confirmed by the Eastern Native Tree Society, include [[Algonquin Provincial Park]], [[Quetico Provincial Park]], and Algoma Highlands in [[Ontario]], Canada; [[Estivant Pines]], [[Huron Mountains]], [[Porcupine Mountains]] State Park, and [[Sylvania Wilderness|Sylvania Wilderness Area]] in the [[Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]], United States; [[Hartwick Pines State Park]] in the [[Lower Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]]; [[Menominee Indian Reservation]] in [[Wisconsin]]; Lost 40 Scientific and Natural Area (SNA) and [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness]] in [[Minnesota]]; [[White Pines State Park]], [[Illinois]]; [[Cook Forest State Park]], [[Hearts Content Scenic Area]], and [[Anders Run Natural Area]] in [[Pennsylvania]]; and the [[Linville Gorge Wilderness]] in [[North Carolina]].\n\nSmall [[Grove (nature)|groves]] or individual specimens of old growth Eastern White Pines are found across the range of the species in the USA, including in Ordway Pines, [[Maine]]; Ice Glen, [[Massachusetts]]; and [[Adirondack Park]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Many sites with conspicuously large specimens represent advanced [[Old field (ecology)|old field]] [[ecological succession]]. The tall stands in [[Mohawk Trail State Forest]] and [[William Cullen Bryant Homestead]] in [[Massachusetts]] are examples.\n\nAs an [[introduced species]], ''Pinus strobus'' is now [[naturalization (biology)|naturalizing]] in the [[Divisions of the Carpathians#Outer Eastern Carpathians|Outer Eastern Carpathians]] subdivision of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in [[Czech Republic]] and southern Poland. It has spread from specimens planted as [[ornamental tree]]s.\n\n== Description ==\nLike all members of the [[Pinus classification#Subgenus Strobus|white pine group]], ''[[Pinus]]'' subgenus ''[[Strobus]]'', the [[leaf|leaves]] (\"needles\") are in fascicles (bundles) of 5, or rarely 3 or 4, with a [[deciduous]] sheath. They are flexible, bluish-green, finely serrated, {{convert|5|-|13|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long, and persist for 18 months, i.e., from the spring of one season until autumn of the next, when they [[abscission|abscise]].\n\nThe [[conifer cone|cones]] are slender, {{convert|8|-|16|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long (rarely longer than that) and {{convert|4|-|5|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad when open, and have scales with a rounded apex and slightly reflexed tip. The [[seed]]s are {{convert|4|-|5|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} long, with a slender {{convert|15|-|20|mm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} wing, and are dispersed by wind. Cone production peaks every 3 to 5&nbsp;years.\n\nWhile Eastern White Pine is self-fertile, seeds produced this way tend to result in weak, stunted, and malformed seedlings.\n\nMature trees are often 200\u2013250 years old, and some live to over 400 years. A tree growing near [[Syracuse, New York]] was dated to 458 years old in the late 1980s and trees in [[Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin]] were dated to approximately 500 years old.\n\n{{Gallery\n|File:Pinus strobus needles3.jpg|foliage\n|File:Pinus strobus Cone.jpg|cone\n|File:Eastern White Pine Pinus strobus Bark Vertical.JPG|bark\n|File:Malecones.jpg|male cones\n}}\n\n=== Dimensions ===\n[[File:Pinus strobus JPG1b.jpg|thumb|right|Measuring the circumference of an Eastern White Pine]]\n\nThe Eastern White Pine has the distinction of being the tallest [[tree]] in eastern [[North America]]. In natural pre-[[Colonial America|colonial]] stands it is reported to have grown as tall as {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}}. There is no means of accurately documenting the height of trees from these times, but Eastern White Pine may have reached this height on rare occasions. Even greater heights have been reported in popular, but unverifiable, accounts such as Robert Pike's \"Tall Trees, Tough Men\".\n\nTotal trunk volumes of the largest specimens are approximately {{convert|28|m3|abbr=on}}, with some past giants possibly reaching {{convert|37|or|40|m3|abbr=on}}. Photographic analysis of giants suggests volumes closer to {{convert|34|m3|abbr=on}}.\n\n==== Height ====\n''Pinus strobus'' grows approximately {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} annually between the ages of 15 and 45 years, with slower height increments before and after that age range.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Beck, D.E. |year=1971 |title=Height-Growth Patterns and Site Index of White Pine in the Southern Appalachians |journal=Forest Science |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=252\u2013260 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/saf/fs/1971/00000017/00000002/art00024}}</ref> The tallest presently living specimens are {{convert|50|\u2013|57.55|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, as determined by the [[Native Tree Society]] (NTS).<ref>[http://www.nativetreesociety.org/ NTS\u2014Native Tree Society]</ref> Three locations in [[southeastern United States]] and one site in [[northeastern United States]] have trees that are {{convert|55|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.\n\nThe southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] have the most locations and the tallest trees in the present range of ''Pinus strobus''. One survivor is a specimen known as the \"Boogerman Pine\" in the [[Cataloochee (Great Smoky Mountains)|Cataloochee Valley]] of [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]. At {{convert|57.55|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, it is the tallest accurately measured tree in North America east of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It has been climbed and measured by tape drop by the Native Tree Society. Before [[Hurricane Opal]] broke its top in October 1995, Boogerman Pine was {{convert|63|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, as determined by Will Blozan and Robert Leverett using ground based measurements.\n\nThe tallest specimens in [[Hartwick Pines State Park]] in [[Michigan]] are {{convert|45|\u2013|48|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall.\n\nIn northeastern USA, 8 sites in 4 states currently have trees over {{convert|48|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, as confirmed by the Native Tree Society. The [[Cook Forest State Park]] of [[Pennsylvania]] has the most numerous collection of {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=on}} Eastern White Pines in the Northeast, with 110 trees measuring that height or more. The Park's \"Longfellow Pine\" is the tallest presently living Eastern White Pine in the Northeast, at {{convert|55.96|m|ftin|abbr=on}} tall, as determined by being climbed and measured by tape drop.<ref>Luthringer, D.J. 2009.

In pure stands mature trees usually have no branches on the lower half of the trunk. The [[white pine weevil]] (''[[White pine weevil|Pissodes strobi]]'') and [[Cronartium ribicola|white pine blister rust]] (''Cronartium ribicola''), an introduced fungus, can damage or kill these trees.\n\n=== Blister rust ===\nMortality from white pine blister rust in mature pine groves was often 50\u201380% during the early 20th century. The fungus must spend part of its life cycle on alternate hosts of the ''[[Ribes]]'' genus, the native gooseberry or wild currant. Foresters proposed that if all the alternate host plants were removed that white pine blister rust might be eliminated. A very determined campaign was mounted and all land owners in commercial pine growing regions were encouraged to uproot and kill all native gooseberry and wild currant plants.<ref name=ling /><ref name=lombard>Lombard K. and J. Bofinger. 1999. White Pine Blister Rust. NH Div. of Forests and Lands.</ref> The ramifications for wildlife and [[habitat]] ecology were of less concern at the time than timber industry protection.\n\nToday native wild currants are relatively rare plants in New England, and planting wild currants or wild gooseberries is strongly discouraged, or even illegal in some jurisdictions. As an alternative, new strains of commercial currants have been developed which are highly resistant to white pine blister rust. Mortality in white pines from rust is only about 3% today.<ref name=lombard />\n\n== Historical uses ==\n\n=== Lumber ===\nIn the 19th century, the harvesting of [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] white pine forests played a major role in America's [[Territorial evolution of the United States|westward expansion]] through the [[Great Plains]]. A quarter million white pines were harvested and sent to lumber yards in [[Chicago]] in a single year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cronon|first=William|title=Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West|year=1991|publisher=W.

Of light weight, it has borne transportation to the farms of the west, where it is used for building purposes in dwellings, barns and corn cribs, while as a fencing material it has no superior. Aside from those conditions which demand a dense strong timber, such as ship-building or in wagon-making, white pine has been found adaptable to all the economic uses in which lumber is required, not excluding its use in coarser articles of furniture. No wood has found greater favor or entered more fully into supplying all those wants of man which could be found in the forest growths.<ref name=\"Hotchkiss 1861 752\" />\n|qalign = left\n|align = center\n|width = 65%\n}}\n\nThe species was imported in 1620 to England by Captain [[George Weymouth]], who planted it for a timber crop, but had little success because of white pine blister rust disease.\n\nOld growth pine in the Americas, of various ''Pinus'' species, was a highly desired wood since huge, knot-free boards were the rule rather than the exception. Pine was common and easy to cut, thus many colonial homes used pine for paneling, floors and furniture. Pine was also a favorite tree of loggers since pine logs can still be processed in a lumber mill a year or more after being cut down. In contrast, most hardwood trees such as cherry, maple, oak, and ash must be cut into 1\u201d thick boards immediately after felling or large cracks will develop in the trunk which can render the wood worthless.<ref name=ling />\n\nAlthough eastern white pine was frequently used for flooring in buildings constructed before the [[U.S. Civil War]], the wood is soft and will tend to cup over time with wear.  [[George Washington]] opted for the much harder [[southern yellow pine]] at Mount Vernon instead.<ref name=ling />\n\n=== Masts ===\nDuring the age of [[square rigger]]s, tall white pines with high quality wood in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] were known as ''[[mast (sailing)|mast]] pines''. Marked by agents of [[the Crown]] with the [[Broad arrow#Use in the American colonies|broad arrow]], these \"mast pines\" were reserved for the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]].\n\nSpecial barge-like vessels were built to ship up to 50 pine trunks destined to become masts.<!-- Ship from where to where? Oceangoing barges? --> The wood was often squared immediately after felling to fit in the holds of ships better.<ref name=ling /> A {{convert|100|ft|m|disp=flip|abbr=on}} mast was about {{convert|3|x|3|ft|cm|disp=flip|abbr=on}} at the butt and {{convert|2|x|2|ft|cm|disp=flip|abbr=on}} at the top, while a {{convert|120|ft|m|disp=flip|abbr=on}} mast was {{convert|4|x|4|ft|m|disp=flip|abbr=on}} by {{convert|30|in|cm|disp=flip|abbr=on}} on its ends.\n\nMarking of large specimens by the Crown was very controversial in the colonies, leading to the [[Pine Tree Riot]] in 1772; its act of rebellion played a significant role in the events leading to the [[American Revolution]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}  During that conflict colonists cut down and hauled off many mast pines.<ref name=nizalowski>Nizalowski, E. 1997.

An unusual large, lone, white pine was found in colonial times in coastal [[South Carolina]] along the [[Black River (South Carolina)|Black River]], far east of its southernmost normal range. The king's mark was carved into it, giving rise to the town of [[Kingstree, South Carolina|Kingstree]].<ref name=\"Williamsburg Hometown Chamber\">{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.williamsburgsc.org/history.htm|accessdate=November 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Contemporary uses ==\n\n=== Lumber ===\n[[File:PinusStrobusBoard.jpg|thumb|Board of ''Pinus strobus'']]\n\nEastern white pine is now widely grown in [[plantation]] [[forestry]] within its native area.\n\nFreshly cut eastern white pine is creamy white or a pale straw color but pine wood which has aged many years tends to darken to a deep rich golden tan. Occasionally one can find light brown pine boards with unusual yellowish-golden or reddish-brown hues. This is the famous \"pumpkin pine\". It is generally thought that slow growing pines in old-growth forests accumulate colored products in the heartwood, but genetic factors and soil conditions may also play a role in rich color development.<ref name=nizalowski />\n\nThis wood is also favored by pattern makers for its easy working.\n\n=== Foods and medicines ===\nEastern white pine needles contain five times the amount of [[Vitamin C]] (by weight) of [[lemon]]s{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} and make an excellent [[herbal tea]]. The [[Vascular cambium|cambium]] is edible. It is also a source of [[resveratrol]]. [[Linnaeus]] noted in the 18th century that cattle and pigs fed pine [[bark bread]] grew well, but he personally did not like the taste. Caterpillars of Lusk's Pinemoth (''[[Coloradia]] luski'') have been found to feed only on ''Pinus strobus''.\n\nPine tar is produced by slowly burning pine roots, branches, or small trunks in a partially smothered flame. Pine tar mixed with beer can be used to remove [[tapeworm]]s (flat worms) or [[nematode]]s (round worms). Pine tar mixed with sulfur is useful to treat dandruff, and marketed in present-day products. Pine tar can also be processed to make [[turpentine]].<ref>Erichsen-Brown, C. 1979. Medicinal and Other Uses of North American Plants.

The [[Chippewa]] also used pine resin to successfully treat infections and even gangrenous wounds.<ref name=umich /> This is because pine resin apparently has a number of quite efficient antimicrobials. Generally a wet pulp from the inner bark, or pine tar mixed with beeswax or butter was applied to wounds and used as a salve to prevent infection.\n\n=== Cultivation ===\n''Pinus strobus'' is cultivated by [[plant nursery|plant nurseries]] as an [[ornamental tree]], for planting in gardens and parks.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=PIST from Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center Native Plant Information Network (NPIN)]; species account, horticultural information, + photographs . accessed 1.13.2013</ref> The species is low-maintenance and rapid growing as a specimen tree.

Eastern white pines are noted for holding their needles well, even long after being harvested. They also are well suited for people with allergies, as they give little to no aroma. A standard {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on|disp=flip|sp=us}} tree takes approximately 6 to 8 years to grow in ideal conditions. Sheared varieties are usually desired because of their stereotypical [[Christmas tree]] conical shape, as naturally grown ones can become too thick for larger ornaments, or grow bushy in texture.<ref>[http://www.christmastree.org/trees/e_wht_pn.cfm Christmas tree.org]</ref> The branches of the eastern white pine are also widely used in making holiday wreaths and garland because of their soft, feathery needles.\n\n== Symbolism ==\nEastern White Pine is the [[Provincial tree emblems of Canada|Provincial Tree]] of [[Ontario]], Canada.<ref>[http://www.sd71.bc.ca/Sd71/Edulinks/Canada/Ontindex.htm Ontario Symbols].

Hence the pine is named as it is generally (but not exclusively) found in lowlands and swampy areas.<ref name=freedictionary/> Loblolly pines grow well in acidic clay soil, which is common throughout the South, and are thus often found in large stands in rural places. Other old names, now rarely used, include oldfield pine, due to its status as an [[Ruderal species|early colonizer]] of abandoned fields; bull pine, due to its size (several other [[Pinus classification#Subgenus Pinus - yellow or hard pines|yellow pines]] are also often so named, especially large isolated specimens); rosemary pine, due to loblolly's distinctive fragrance compared to the other southern pines; and North Carolina pine.<ref name=\"Moore2008\">{{cite book |author1=Moore, Gerry |author2=Kershner, Bruce |author3=Craig Tufts |author4=Daniel Mathews |author5=Gil Nelson |author6=Spellenberg, Richard |author7=Thieret, John W. |author8=Terry Purinton |author9=Block, Andrew |title=National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Trees of North America |publisher=Sterling |location=New York |year=2008 |page=73 |isbn=1-4027-3875-7}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[scientific name]], ''[[wikt:Pinus|Pinus]]''  is the Latin name for the pines and ''[[wikt:taeda|taeda]]''  refers to the resinous wood.<ref>[http://www.biosurvey.ou.edu/shrub/pita.htm Oklahoma Biological Survey: ''Pinus taeda'' L.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Tree Types and Barks 004.jpg|left|thumb|Bark on a mature tree]]\n\n== Ecology ==\nWith the advent of [[wildfire suppression]], loblolly pine has come to prevalence in some parts of the deep south that were once dominated by longleaf pine and, especially in northern [[Florida]], [[Pinus elliottii|slash pine]].<ref>Richardson, D.

The usual size range for this [[pine]] is 9\u201318&nbsp;m, but can grow taller under optimum conditions. The trunk can be as large as 0.5&nbsp;m diameter. This tree prefers well-drained [[loam]] or clay, but will also grow on very poor, sandy soil, where it remains small and stunted. The typical life span is 65 to 90 years.\n\nThe short (4\u20138&nbsp;cm), yellow-green needles are paired in [[Fascicle (botany)|fascicles]] and are often twisted. [[Pinecone]]s are 4\u20137&nbsp;cm long and may persist on the tree for many years, often (though not always) releasing their seeds in the second year. In growth habit, some trees may be inclined with twisted trunks.\n\nThis pine is useful for [[reforesting]] and provides nourishment for wildlife. Its other main use is on [[Christmas tree farm]]s, despite having sharp-tipped [[Pine needle|needles]] and yellowish winter color. It also can provide [[wood pulp]] and [[lumber]].

They used it for many symptoms like diarrhea, stiffness of the body, colds, fevers, hemorrhoids, tuberculosis, and constipation. Cherokee Indians used ''P. virginiana'' in different ways including bathing in water that had been soaked in the bark, steams and oils, root and needle infusions, and for tar. They also used it in certain cultural rituals. In burial rituals ''P. virginiana'' branches were burned and the ashes were used for a fire in their homes. Also, they would infuse needles in apple juice and they would drink it. The Cherokee basically did that as a toast to the wind. Lastly, they used the root infusions as a stimulant and the needles were used as a soap.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe etymology of the ''Pinus virginiana'' is as follows: ''Pinus'' is Latin for Pine and ''virginiana'' means of Virginia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schoennagel |first1=Tania |last2=Veblen |first2=Thomas T. |last3=Romme |first3=William H. |date=July 2004 |title=The Interaction of Fire, Fuels, and Climate across Rocky Mountain Forests |journal=BioScience|volume=54 |issue=7 |pages=661\u2013676 |issn=0006-3568 |url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~schoenna/images/Schoennagel2004BioScience.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n''Pinus virginiana'' was used historically as mine timbers, for railroad ties, and for fuel and tar.

It is usually called [[sycamore]] in North America, a name which can refer to other types of [[tree]] in other parts of the world.  The name is derived from the Greek word \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (''platanos''), meaning flat, and the Latin word occidentalis meaning \"of the west\", and \"sycamore\" is derived from the ancient Greek \u03c3\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (''s\u016bkomoros'') meaning \"fig-mulberry\".\n\n==Description==\nAn American sycamore tree can often be easily distinguished from other trees by its mottled exfoliating bark which flakes off in great irregular masses, leaving the surface mottled, and greenish-white, gray and brown. The bark of all trees has to yield to a growing trunk by stretching, splitting, or infilling; the sycamore shows the process more openly than many other trees. The explanation is found in the rigid texture of the bark tissue which lacks the elasticity of the bark of some other trees, so it is incapable of stretching to accommodate the growth of the wood underneath, so the tree sloughs it off.<ref name=Keeler>{{cite book |last=Keeler |first=Harriet L. |title=Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |year=1900 |location =New York |pages=263\u2013268}}</ref>\n\nA sycamore can grow to massive proportions, typically reaching up to {{convert|30|to|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|1.5|to|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter when grown in deep soils. The largest of the species have been measured to {{convert|51|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and nearly {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter. Larger specimens were recorded in historical times. In 1744, a Shenandoah Valley settler named Joseph Hampton and two sons lived for most of the year in a hollow sycamore in what is now Clarke County, Virginia.<ref>{{Cite book|title = A History of the Valley of Virginia|last = Kercheval|first = Samuel|publisher = Samuel H.

Spreading limbs at the top make an irregular, open head. Roots are fibrous. The trunks of large trees are often hollow.\n\nAnother peculiarity is the way the leaves grow sticky, green buds. In early August, most trees in general will have&mdash;nestled in the axils of their leaves&mdash;the tiny forming bud which will produce the leaves of the coming year. The sycamore branch apparently has no such buds. Instead there is an enlargement of the petiole which encloses the bud in a tight-fitting case at the base of the petiole.<ref name=Keeler />\n\n* Bark: Dark reddish brown, broken into oblong plate-like scales; higher on the tree, it is smooth and light gray; separates freely into thin plates which peel off and leave the surface pale yellow, or white, or greenish. Branchlets at first pale green, coated with thick pale tomentum, later dark green and smooth, finally become light gray or light reddish brown.\n* Wood: Light brown, tinged with red; heavy, weak, difficult to split. Largely used for furniture and interior finish of houses, butcher's blocks. [[Specific gravity]], 0.5678; [[relative density]], {{convert|33.539|lb/ft3|disp=flip|abbr=on}}.\n* Winter buds: Large, stinky, sticky, green, and three-scaled, they form in summer within the petiole of the full grown leaf. The inner scales enlarge with the growing shake. There is no terminal bud.\n* Leaves: Alternate, palmately nerved, broadly ovate or orbicular, {{convert|4|to|9|in|cm|disp=flip|abbr=on}} inches long, truncate or cordate or wedge-shaped at base, decurrent on the petiole. Three to five-lobed by broad shallow sinuses rounded in the bottom; lobes acuminate, toothed, or entire, or undulate. They come out of the bud plicate, pale green coated with pale tomentum; when full grown are bright yellow green above, paler beneath. In autumn they turn brown and wither before falling. Petioles long, abruptly enlarged at base and inclosing the buds. Stipules with spreading, toothed borders, conspicuous on young shoots, caducous.\n* Flowers: May, with the leaves; monoecious, borne in dense heads. Staminate and pistillate heads on separate peduncles. Staminate heads dark red, on axillary peduncles; pistillate heads light green tinged with red, on longer terminal peduncles. Calyx of staminate flowers three to six tiny scale-like sepals, slightly united at the base, half as long as the pointed petals. Of pistillate flowers three to six, usually four, rounded sepals, much shorter than the acute petals. Corolla of three to six thin scale-like petals.\n* Stamens: In staminate flowers as many of the divisions of the calyx and opposite to them; filaments short; anthers elongated, two-celled; cells opening by lateral slits; connectives hairy.\n* Pistil: Ovary superior, one-celled, sessile, ovate-oblong, surrounded at base by long, jointed, pale hairs; styles long, incurved, red, stigmatic, ovules one or two.\n* Fruit: Brown heads, solitary or rarely clustered, {{convert|1|in|cm|disp=flip|abbr=on}} in diameter, hanging on slender stems three to six inches long; persistent through the winter. These heads are composed of [[achene]]s about two-thirds of an inch in length.

''Gnomonia platani''), an introduced fungus found naturally on the [[Platanus orientalis|Oriental plane]] ''P. orientalis'', which has evolved considerable resistance to the disease. Although rarely killed or even seriously harmed, American sycamore is commonly partially [[Defoliation|defoliated]] by the disease, rendering it unsightly as a specimen tree.\n\nSometimes mistaken for frost damage, the disease manifests in early spring, wilting new leaves and causing mature leaves to turn brown along the veins.  Infected leaves typically shrivel and fall, so that by summer the tree is regrowing its foliage.  Cankers form on twigs and branches near infected leaves, serving to spread the disease by spore production and also weakening the tree. Because cankers restrict the flow of nutrients, twigs and branches afflicted by cankers eventually die.  [[Witch's broom]] is a symptom reflecting the cycle of twigs dying.<ref>{{cite web|last=Swift|first=C.E.|title=Sycamore Anthracnose|url=http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/02930.html|publisher=Colorado State University Extension|accessdate=18 April 2013|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the fungus' damage, American sycamore is often avoided as a landscape tree, and the more resistant [[London plane]] (''P. \u00d7 hispanica''; hybrid ''P. occidentalis \u00d7 P. orientalis'') is planted instead.\n\n==History==\n\nThe terms under which the [[New York Stock Exchange]] was formed are called the \"[[Buttonwood Agreement]],\" because it was signed under a buttonwood (sycamore) tree at 68 [[Wall Street]], [[New York City]] in 1792.\n\nThe sycamore made up a large part of the forests of Greenland and Arctic America during the [[Cretaceous]] and [[Tertiary period]]s.

Leaves are similar to ''[[Populus tremuloides]]'', but slightly larger and having larger teeth.<ref>{{cite book |title=Trees and Shrubs of Minnesota: the Complete Guide to Species Identification |first=Welby R. |last=Smith |publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]] |date=2008 }}</ref>  The leaves tremble in the wind as ''P. tremuloides'' does.  Bark of younger trees is olive-green, thin and smooth; after 30\u201340 years, the bark is grey, thick and rough with grooves.\n\n== Reproduction ==\nBigtooth aspens produce seeds from the flower clusters, known as [[catkin]]s. The seed, a two-valved capsule, is distributed widely by the wind. Individuals can also reproduce through the roots after a disturbance event, such as fire or harvest; the roots of the dead/cut tree will begin to send up suckers, creating identical individuals, and can result in a stand of clones that resemble that individual.<ref name=\"rook.org\">http://www.rook.org/earl/bwca/nature/trees/populusgrand.html</ref>\n\n== Growth ==\nBigtooth aspens are [[dioecious]], medium-sized deciduous trees with straight trunks and gently ascending branches. Heights at maturity are around {{convert|60|\u2013|80|ft|m}} with diameters of {{convert|8|\u2013|10|in|cm}}. They are fast growing and are relatively short-lived; stands will begin to deteriorate after 60\u201370 years, while individuals can live up to 100 years. They often constitute early successional species of their landscapes.  Roots are shallow and wide spreading; lateral root growth in a forest may be as far as {{convert|60|ft}}.<ref name=\"rook.org\" /> Generally, four to five lateral roots originate from the tree, and then branch within {{convert|2|ft|cm|sigfig=1}}; vertical, penetrating roots near the base anchor the tree.\n\n== Distribution ==\nThe range of ''Populus grandidentata'' extends from Virginia north to Maine and Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia; west to southeastern Manitoba and Minnesota; south through Iowa to extreme northeastern Missouri; and east through Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and West Virginia.  Disjunct populations are found in Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina.<ref>http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/popgra/all.html</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe species is able to adapt to a wide range of soils, though it is most abundant on sands, loamy sands and light sandy loams.  Big-tooth aspens can tolerate sandy uplands and high, rocky sites. The depth to the water table is generally about {{convert|5|ft}}.<ref>{{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Populus |species=grandidentata |first=Paul R. |last=Laidly}}</ref> Soil must be moist but well-aerated for good growth. Being very shade intolerant, most shaded stems die. They are pioneer species on disturbed sites, persisting in successional communities until senescence. Rapid height growth of suckers allows it to outcompete other sprouting species such as [[red oak]] (''Quercus rubra'') and [[red maple]] (''Acer rubrum'') on many sites. In the absence of disturbance, it is soon replaced by conifers and hardwoods. In the Great Lakes Region at the turn of the 20th century, many mature pine forests were logged and burned. Bigtooth and quaking aspens frequently dominated the postdisturbance forests. Without fire or other disturbance, these forests are being replaced by later successional, shade-tolerant species. This aspen usually grows in even-aged, mixed stands, most commonly with quaking aspens. Codominant in both hardwood and conifer forests, it does not occur as a subdominant because of its extreme shade intolerance. [[Quaking aspen]] (''Populus tremuloides'') is the predominant species in aspen stands in the Great Lakes region, but bigtooth aspen dominates on drier, upland sites. Aspen stands dominated by bigtooth aspens are generally more open than those dominated by quaking aspens. It is more disease resistant than ''P. tremuloides''. The most serious disease is hypoxylon canker (caused by ''[[Entoleuca mammata]]''). Other rots, fungi, and root decay affect this species. A preferred host of [[gypsy moth]], death occurs when nearly complete defoliation by gypsy moths is followed by a fungal infection by ''[[Armillaria]]'' spp. The ambrosia beetle (''[[Xyleborus saxesceni]]'') attacks fire-damaged bigtooth aspens. Commonly, it occurs in areas that frequently burn, such as large upland areas distant from water and upwind of natural fire breaks, such as lakes.\n\n== Uses ==\nThe wood is light-colored, straight-grained, fine-textured, and soft. It is used primarily for pulp, but can be used to make particle board and structural panels. Minor uses include log homes, pallets, boxes, match splints, chopsticks, hockey stick components, and ladders.  The bark is pelletized for fuel and supplemental cattle feed.\n\n== References ==\n{{USGovernment|sourceUrl=https://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/silvics_manual/Volume_2/populus/grandidentata.htm}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{PLANTS|symbol=POGR4|name=Populus grandidentata}}\n* [http://herb.umd.umich.edu/herb/search.pl?searchstring=Populus+grandidentata University of Michigan at Dearborn: Native American Ethnobotany of ''Populus grandidentata'']\n\n[[Category:Populus|grandidentata]]\n[[Category:Flora of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Trees of Ontario]]\n[[Category:Trees of temperate climates]]\n[[Category:Plants used in traditional Native American medicine]]",

The Great Alaska Nature Factbook. Portland: Alaska Northwest Books, 1996.</ref>\n\n=== Dieback ===\nBeginning in 1996, individual North American scientists noticed an increase in dead or dying aspen trees. As this accelerated in 2004, word spread and a debate over causes began. No insect, disease, or environmental condition is yet specifically identified as a joint cause. Trees adjacent to one another are often stricken or not. In other instances, entire groves have died.\n\nMany areas of the Western US have experienced increased diebacks which are often attributed to ungulate grazing and [[wildfire suppression]]. At high altitudes where grasses can be rare, [[ungulate]]s can browse young aspen sprouts and prevent those young trees from reaching maturity. As a result, some aspen groves close to cattle or other grazing animals, such as deer or elk, have very few young trees and can be invaded by [[conifers]], which are not typically browsed. Another possible deterrent to aspen regeneration is widespread wildfire suppression.  Aspens are vigorous [[resprouter]]s and even though the above-ground portion of the organism may die in a wild-fire, the roots, which are often protected from lethal temperatures during a fire, will sprout new trees soon after a fire.  Disturbances such as fires seem to be a necessary ecological event in order for aspens to compete with conifers, which tend to replace aspen over long, disturbance-free intervals.  The current dieback in the American West may have roots in the strict fire suppression policy in the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} On the other hand, the widespread decimation of conifer forests by the [[mountain pine beetle]] may provide increased opportunities for aspen groves to proliferate under the right conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112713000352 | doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2013.01.008 | volume=299 | title=How will aspen respond to mountain pine beetle?

Yet they are still widely used in campgrounds because they are cheap and plentiful and not widely used in building lumber. Pioneers in the North American west used them to create [[log cabins]] and [[dugout (shelter)|dugouts]], though they were not the preferred species.\n\nThe leaves of the quaking aspen and other species in the genus ''Populus'' serve as food for [[caterpillar]]s of various moths and butterflies. See [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on poplars]].\n\nIn Canada, quaking aspen wood is used mainly for pulp products such as books, newsprint, and fine printing paper. It is especially good for panel products such as [[oriented strand board]] and [[waferboard]]. It is light in weight and is used for furniture, boxes and crates, core stock in plywood, and wall panels.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons and category-inline}}\n* {{Wikispecies-inline}}\n* [http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/poptre/all.html US Forest Service Fire Effects Information System: ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* [http://www.abtreegene.com/trees.html Alberta Forest Genetic Resources Council: ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* [http://www.plantmaps.com/nrm/populus-tremuloides-quaking-aspen-native-range-map.php Interactive Distribution Map for ''Populus tremuloides'']\n* {{ITIS |id=195773 |taxon=Populus tremuloides |accessdate=8 August 2006}}\n* Farrar, John Laird.

It can also be found in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] as far south as northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and eastern [[Tennessee]]. Scattered growth of the Pin cherry also occurs in the [[Rocky Mountains]], south to [[Colorado]] as well as in the [[Black Hills]] of [[South Dakota]].<ref>{{BONAP|ref|genus=Prunus|species=pensylvanica}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe pin cherry can regenerate by seed and sprout. Its flowers are bisexual and pollinated by insects. Seeds are dispersed by birds, small mammals, and gravity. As part of its reproductive strategy, pin cherries seeds can remain viable in the soil for many years. Seeds accumulate over prolonged periods, and [[soil seed bank]]s may be viable for 50\u2013100 years. Asexual reproduction is achieved by sprouting, and often thickets of pin cherry plants form.<ref name=tammy />\n\nThe pin cherry is rather short lived, having a lifespan of only 20 to 40 years following a rapid maturation. Its [[root system]] is shallow, with roots tending to grow laterally. It is an important food source for many animals. Winter [[moose]] browse it in the Great Lake states and [[boreal forest]] region.<ref name=tammy />\n\nThough they are documented to sprout following cutting, individual pin cherry thickets are often killed if exposed to fire. Nonetheless, they have adapted as a species by the establishment of their seed banks which are protected from the most severe heat by their soil cover and fed by the nutrients in the resultant ash residue. Following a fire or other disturbance, seeds which may be dormant for years will germinate rapidly, stimulated by the altered conditions after fire. Combined with the rapid initial growth of seedlings, these characteristics enable groupings of Pin cherry thickets to dominate many burned-over areas, particularly in the northern hardwood forest.\n\nThe pin cherry serves as foodplant for various [[Lepidoptera]]. See [[List of Lepidoptera which feed on Prunus|List of Lepidoptera which feed on ''Prunus'']].\n\n== Uses ==\n\n=== Food ===\nPin cherry currently has little commercial value, though recent interest in commercial production of pin cherry fruit has emerged. The fruit is edible and can be used in [[jam]]s, jellies and preserves.\n\n=== Lumber ===\nPin cherry wood is light, moderately soft, porous, and low in strength giving it little commercial value. In general, it is not used for lumber and is considered a noncommercial species. It occurs in abundance, however, over a wide range of sites and produces large quantities of biomass in a relatively short time. The species has been described as well adapted to intensive management and chip harvesting on short rotations for fiber and fuel.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|26em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|position=left|Prunus pensylvanica}}\n\n[[Category:Prunus|pensylvanica]]\n[[Category:Cherries]]\n[[Category:Trees of Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Appalachian Mountains]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Plains-Midwest (United States)]]\n[[Category:Natural history of the Great Smoky Mountains]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1782]]\n[[Category:Butterfly food plants]]",

Leaves are 2\" to 5\" in length, ovate-lanceolate in shape, with finely toothed margins. Fall leaf color is yellow to red. Flowers are small, white and 5-petalled, in racemes 4\" to 6\" long which contain several dozen flowers. The flowers give rise to edible reddish-black \"berries\" ([[drupes]]).<ref name=\"NCCE\"/>\n\nA mature black cherry tree can easily be identified in a forest by its very broken, dark grey to black bark, which has the appearance of very thick, burnt cornflakes. However, for about the first decade or so of its life, the bark is thin, smooth, and banded, resembling that of a [[birch]]. It can also quickly be identified by its long, shiny leaves resembling those of a [[sourwood]], and by an almond-like odor released when a young twig is scratched and held close to the nose.<ref>This odor is the result of minute amounts of [[cyanide]] compounds produced and stored by the plant as a defense mechanism against [[herbivore]]s.

In the [[Midwest]], it is seen growing mostly in old fields with other sunlight-loving species, such as [[black walnut]], [[black locust]], and [[Celtis|hackberry]]. Gleason and Cronquist (1991) describe ''P. serotina'' as \"[f]ormerly a forest tree, now abundant as a weed-tree of roadsides, waste land, and forest-margins.\"<ref>Gleason, Henry A. and Arthur Cronquist.  1991.  \"Manual of Vascular Plants of Northeastern United States and Adjacent Canada, Second Edition.\"  The New York Botanical Garden.  Bronx, New York.  910 pp.</ref> It is a moderately long-lived tree, with ages of up to 258 years known, though it is prone to storm damage, with branches breaking easily; any decay resulting, however, only progresses slowly. Seed production begins around 10 years of age, but does not become heavy until 30 years and continues up to 100 years or more. Germination rates are high, and the seeds are widely dispersed by birds who eat the fruit and then excrete them. Some seeds however may remain in the [[Soil seed bank|soil bank]] and not germinate for as long as three years. All ''Prunus'' species have hard seeds that benefit from [[Scarification (botany)|scarification]] to germinate (which in nature is produced by passing through an animal's digestive tract).\n\n[[File:2014-11-02 11 47 15 Black Cherry foliage during autumn along Upper Ferry Road in Ewing, New Jersey.JPG|thumb|right|Autumn foliage]]\n''P.&nbsp;serotina'' is also a host of [[caterpillar]]s of various [[Lepidoptera]] (see [[List of Lepidoptera which feed on Prunus|List of Lepidoptera which feed on ''Prunus'']]).

It is a common element of America's north central and northeastern mixed forests. It can survive in a variety of habitats. It forms [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] with [[bur oak]] where they occur together in the wild.\n\n== Description ==\n''Quercus bicolor'' grows rapidly and can reach {{convert|60|to|80|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} tall with the tallest known reaching {{convert|29|m|ft|abbr=on}} <ref>Muhlenberg, Ges. Naturf. Freunde Berlin Neue Schriften. 3: 396. 1801.</ref> and lives up to 350 years.\nThe [[bark]] resembles that of the white oak. The [[leaf|leaves]] are broad [[ovoid]], {{convert|12|\u2013|18|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|7|-|11|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} broad, always more or less glaucous on the underside, and are shallowly lobed with five to seven lobes on each side, intermediate between the [[chestnut oak]] and the [[Quercus alba|white oak]].   In autumn, they turn brown, yellow-brown, or sometimes reddish, but generally, the color is not as reliable or as brilliant as the white oak can be. The [[fruit]] is a [[peduncle (botany)|peduncled]] [[acorn]], {{convert|1.5|\u2013|2|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} (rarely {{convert|2.5|cm|in|disp=or|abbr=on}}) long and {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} broad, maturing about 6 months after pollination.<ref name=tammy>{{eFloras|1|233501012|Quercus bicolor}}</ref>\n\n{{Gallery\n|Image:Quercus bicolor JPG1L.jpg|Leaves\n|File:Swamp White Oak Quercus bicolor Bark Closeup Vertical.JPG|Bark\n}}\n\n== Habitat ==\nThe swamp white oak generally occurs singly in four different forest types: black ash-American elm-red maple, silver maple-American elm, bur oak, and pin oak-sweetgum. Occasionally the swamp white oak is abundant in small areas. It is found within a very wide range of mean annual temperatures from {{convert|16|to|4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. Extremes in temperature vary from {{convert|41|to|-34|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. Average annual precipitation is from {{convert|640|to|1270|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The frost-free period ranges from 210 days in the southern part of the growing area to 120 days in the northern part.\nThe swamp white oak typically grows on hydromorphic soils. It is not found where flooding is permanent, although it is usually found in broad stream valleys, low-lying fields, and the margins of lakes, ponds, or sloughs.\n\n== Range ==\nSwamp white oak, a lowland tree, is widespread in the eastern and central United States and eastern and central Canada, from [[Nova Scotia]] to [[South Carolina]], west as far as [[Ontario]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Tennessee]] with a few isolated populations in [[Nebraska]] and [[Alabama]]. This species is most common and reaches its largest size in western [[New York (state)|New York]] and northern [[Ohio]].<ref>{{Silvics |volume=2 |genus=Quercus |species=bicolor |accessdate=14 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{BONAP|ref|genus=Quercus|species=bicolor}}</ref>\n\n== Cultivation and uses ==\nIt is one of the more important white oaks for [[lumber]] production. In recent years, the swamp white oak has become a popular landscaping tree, partly due to its relative ease of transplanting.\n\nBeing in the white oak group, wildlife such as deer, ducks, and geese, as well as other animals are attracted to this tree when acorns are dropping in the fall.\n\n== Cultivars ==\n''Quercus robur fastigiata x Quercus bicolor'' 'Nadler' [[Kindred Spirit Hybrid Oak]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=QUBI USDA Plants Profile for ''Quercus bicolor'']\n*[http://www.na.fs.fed.us/pubs/silvics_manual/volume_2/quercus/bicolor.htm USDA National Forest Service, Silvic Manual: ''Quercus bicolor'']\n*[http://www.cas.vanderbilt.edu/bioimages/species/frame/qubi.htm ''Quercus bicolor'' images from Vanderbilt University]\n*[http://www.tropicos.org/ImageFullView.aspx?imageid=100293574 photo of herbarium specimen at Missouri Botanical Garden, collected in Missouri in 1934]\n{{Commons|position=left|Quercus bicolor}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n\n[[Category:Quercus|bicolor]]\n[[Category:Trees of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Eastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of humid continental climate]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1801]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Ludwig Willdenow]]",

It sometimes spreads vegetatively by means of underground rhizomes.<ref>Hightshoe, G.L. (1988). Native Trees, Shrubs, and Vines for Urban and Rural America.

It is a native of North America, in the eastern and central United States and southeast and south-central Canada. It grows from the north end of the [[Great Lakes (North America)|Great Lakes]], east to [[Nova Scotia]], south as far as [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], and [[Louisiana]], and west to [[Oklahoma]], [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], and [[Minnesota]].<ref>{{BONAP|ref|genus=Quercus|species=rubra}}</ref> It has been introduced to small areas in Western Europe, where it can frequently be seen cultivated in gardens and parks. It prefers good soil that is slightly [[Soil pH|acidic]]. Often simply called '''red oak''', northern red oak is so named to distinguish it from [[southern red oak]] (''[[Quercus falcata|Q. falcata]]''), also known as the Spanish oak. It is also the [[List of U.S. state trees|state tree]] of [[New Jersey]] and the [[list of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols|provincial tree]] of [[Prince Edward Island]].\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Quercusrubra.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Wood of the Red Oak.

A few other oaks have bark with this kind of appearance in the upper tree, but the northern red oak is the only tree with the striping all the way down the trunk.<ref name=tammy />\n\n* Bark: Dark reddish grey brown, with broad, thin, rounded ridges, scaly. On young trees and large stems, smooth and light gray. Rich in tannic acid. Branchlets slender, at first bright green, shining, then dark red, finally dark brown. Bark is brownish gray, becoming dark brown on old trees.\n* Wood: Pale reddish brown, sapwood darker, heavy, hard, strong, coarse-grained. Cracks in drying, but when carefully treated could be successfully used for furniture. Also used in construction and for interior finish of houses. Sp. gr., 0.6621; weight of cu. ft., 41.25&nbsp;lbs.\n* Winter buds: Dark chestnut brown (reddish brown), ovate, acute, generally 6&nbsp;mm long<ref name=tammy />\n* Leaves: Alternate, seven to nine-lobed, oblong-ovate to oblong, five to ten inches long, four to six inches broad; seven to eleven lobes tapering gradually from broad bases, acute, and usually repandly dentate and terminating with long bristle-pointed teeth; the second pair of lobes from apex are largest; midrib and primary veins conspicuous. Lobes are less deeply cut than most other oaks of the red oak group (except for [[Quercus velutina|black oak]] which can be similar). Leaves emerge from the bud convolute, pink, covered with soft silky down above, coated with thick white tomentum below. When full grown are dark green and smooth, sometimes shining above, yellow green, smooth or hairy on the axils of the veins below. In autumn they turn a rich red, sometimes brown. Often the petiole and midvein are a rich red color in midsummer and early autumn, though this is not true of all red oaks. The acorns mature in about 18 months after [[pollination]]; solitary or in pairs, sessile or stalked; nut oblong-ovoid with broad flat base, full, with acute apex, one half to one and one-fourth of an inch long, first green, maturing nut-brown; cup, saucer-shaped and shallow, {{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, usually covering only the base, sometimes one-fourth of the nut, thick, shallow, reddish brown, somewhat downy within, covered with thin imbricated reddish brown scales.

Quality red oak is of high value as lumber and veneer, while defective logs are used as [[firewood]]. Other related oaks are also cut and marketed as red oak, although their wood is not always of as high a quality. These include [[eastern black oak]], [[scarlet oak]], [[pin oak]], [[Shumard oak]], [[southern red oak]] and other species in the red oak group. Construction uses include flooring, veneer, interior trim, and furniture. It is also used for lumber, railroad ties, and fence posts.\n\nRed oak wood grain is so open that smoke can be blown through it from end-grain to end-grain on a flat-sawn board. For this reason, it is subject to moisture infiltration and is unsuitable for outdoor uses such as boatbuilding or exterior trim.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n=== Ornamental use ===\n''Quercus rubra'' is grown in parks and large gardens as a specimen tree.<ref>{{cite web|title=RHS Plant Selector \u2013 ''Quercus rubra''|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/plantselector/plant?plantid=3485|accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref> It is not planted as often as the closely related [[Pin Oak]] as it develops a taproot and quickly becomes difficult to transplant. Acorns should either be sown in the location where the tree is intended to be planted or else moved to their permanent location within the seedling's first year. As the tree gets older, the taproot gradually becomes less dominant and the lateral root network expands. Northern Red Oak is easy to start from seed, however the acorns must be protected from animal predation over the winter months.\n\nAs with other oaks, germination takes place in late spring when all frost danger has passed. The seedling grows rapidly for its first month, then pauses for another month, and sends out more new shoots until September when growth stops for the year. If the weather stays favorable, a third burst of growth may occur.\n\nThis oak is grown across Canada almost everywhere it will grow. It has naturalized in southeastern British Columbia near the Alberta border.\n\n== Famous specimens ==\n*[[Ashford Oak]] \u2013 A very large Northern Red Oak in [[Ashford, Connecticut|Ashford]], Connecticut.

C. |last=Huntley |accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref> and therefore is typical of young woodlands disturbed areas where sunlight is plentiful and soil is dry, in this sense, black locust can often grow as a weed tree. It also often spreads by underground shoots or [[sucker (botany)|suckers]] which contribute to the weedy character of this species.<ref name=\"dirr\" /> Young trees are often spiny, however, mature trees often lack spines. In the early summer black locust flowers; the flowers are large and appear in large, intensely fragrant (reminiscent of orange blossoms), clusters. The leaflets fold together in wet weather and at night ([[nyctinasty]]) as some change of position at night is a habit of the entire [[fabaceae|leguminous]] family.\n<!--there's redundant info from the more detailed section below, but this is intended as an intro-->\n\nAlthough similar in general appearance to the [[honey locust]], it lacks that tree's characteristic long branched thorns on the trunk, instead having the pairs of short prickles at the base of each leaf; the leaflets are also much broader then honey locust. It may also resemble [[Styphnolobium japonicum]] which has smaller flower spikes and lacks spines.\n\n=== Detailed description ===\n[[File:Black Locust Leaf Close Up.jpg|thumb|left|One black locust leaf showing 13 leaflets]]\n*The '''bark''' is dark gray brown and tinged with red or orange in the grooves. It is deeply furrowed into grooves and ridges which run up and down the trunk and often cross and form diamond shapes.<ref name=\"dirr\" />\n*The '''roots''' of black locust contain [[Root Nodules|nodules]] which allow it to [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] as is common within the pea family.\n*The '''branches''' are typically zig-zagy and may have ridges and grooves or may be round.<ref name=\"dirr\" /> When young, they are at first coated with white silvery down, this soon disappears and they become pale green and afterward reddish or greenish brown.\n*'''[[prickle (botany)|Prickles]]''' may or may not be present on young trees, root [[sucker (botany)|suckers]], and branches near the ground; typically, branches high above the ground rarely contain prickles. ''R. pseudoacacia'' is quite variable in the quantity and amount of prickles present as some trees are densely prickly and other trees have no prickles at all. The prickles typically remain on the tree until the young thin bark to which they are attached is replaced by the thicker mature bark. They develop from [[stipules]]<ref name=\"foc\" /> (small leaf like structures which grow at the base of leaves) and since stipules are paired at the base of leaves, the prickles will be paired at the bases of leaves. They range from {{convert|.25-.8|in|cm}} in length and are somewhat triangular with a flared base and sharp point. Their color is of a dark purple and they adhere only to the bark.<ref name=\"foc\">{{eFloras|2|200012304|Robinia pseudoacacia|accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref>\n*'''Wood''': Pale yellowish brown; heavy, hard, strong, close-grained and very durable in contact with the ground. The wood has a [[specific gravity]] of 0.7333, and a weight of approximately 45.7 pounds per cubic foot.\n*The '''leaves''' are [[compound leaf|compound]], meaning that each leaf contains many smaller leaf like structures called [[leaflet (botany)|leaflets]], the leaflets are roughly paired on either side of the stem which runs through the leaf ([[rachis]]) and there is typically one leaflet at the tip of the leaf ([[Glossary of leaf morphology#imparipinnate|odd pinnate]]). The leaves are alternately arranged on the stem. Each leaf is {{convert|6-14|in|cm}} long and contains 9-19 leaflets, each being {{convert|1-2|in|cm}}long, and {{convert|.25-.75|in|cm}} wide. The leaflets are rounded or slightly indented at the tip and typically rounded at the base. The leaves come out of the bud folded in half, yellow green, covered with silvery down which soon disappears. Each leaflet initially has a minute stipel, which quickly falls, and is connected to the ([[rachis]]) by a short stem or petiolule. The leaves are attached to the branch with slender hairy [[petiole (botany)|petioles]] which is grooved and swollen at the base. The [[stipule]]s are linear, downy, membranous at first and occasionally develop into prickles. The leaves appear relatively late in spring.\n*The '''leaf color''' of the fully grown leaves is a dull dark green above and paler beneath.  In the fall the leaves turn a clear pale yellow.\n[[File:Robinia pseudoacacia 004.JPG|thumb|upright|Closeup of flowers]]\n\n*The '''flowers''' open in May or June for 7\u201310 days, after the leaves have developed. They are arranged in loose drooping clumps ([[raceme]]s) which are typically {{convert|4-8|in|cm}} long.<ref name=\"dirr\" /> The flowers themselves are cream-white (rarely pink or purple) with a pale yellow blotch in the center and imperfectly [[papilionaceous]] in shape. They are  about {{convert|1|in|cm}} wide, very fragrant, and produce large amounts of nectar. Each flower is perfect, having both [[stamens]] and a [[pistil]] (male and female parts). There are 10 stamens enclosed within the petals; these are fused together in a diadelphous configuration, where the [[stamen|filaments]] of 9 are all joined to form a tube and one stamen is separate and above the joined stamens. The single ovary is superior and contains several ovules. Below each flower is a [[Calyx (flower)|calyx]] which looks like leafy tube between the flower and the stem. It is made from fused [[sepal]]s and is dark green and may be blotched with red. The [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]] (stems which connect the flower to the branch) are slender, {{convert|.5|in|cm}}, dark red or reddish green.\n*The '''fruit''' is a typical [[legume]] fruit, being a flat and smooth pea-like pod {{convert|2-4|in|cm}} long and {{convert|.5|in|cm}} broad. The fruit usually contains 4-8 seeds.<ref name=\"dirr\" /> The seeds are dark orange brown with irregular markings. They ripen late in autumn and hang on the branches until early spring.<ref name=\"Keeler\">{{cite book | last =Keeler | first =Harriet L. | title =Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them | publisher =Charles Scriber's Sons | year =1900 | location =New York | pages =97\u2013102 }}</ref> There are typically 25500 seeds per pound.<ref name=\"usda factsheet\" />\n*'''Winter [[bud]]s''': Minute, naked (having no scales covering them), three or four together, protected in a depression by a scale-like covering lined on the inner surface with a thick coat of tomentum and opening in early spring.

It prefers dry to moist limestone soils but will grow on most soils as long as they are not wet or poorly drained.<ref name=\"sylv\" />  This tree tolerates a soil pH range of 4.6 to 8.2.<ref name=\"usda factsheet\" /> Within its native range it will often grow on soils of [[Inceptisols]], [[Ultisols]], and [[Alfisols]] groups. Black locust does not do well on compacted, clayey or eroded soils. Black locust is a part of the [[Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests]].\n\nBlack locust is not a particularly valuable plant for wildlife, but does provide valuable cover when planted on previously open areas. Its seeds are also eaten by [[bobwhite quail]] and other game birds and squirrels. Woodpeckers may also nest in the trunk since older trees are often infected by heart rot.\n\n== Pests ==\nLocust leaf miner ''[[Odontota dorsalis]]'' attacks the tree in spring and turns the leaves brown by mid summer, it slows the growth of the tree but not seriously.<ref name=\"usda factsheet\" /> The locust borer ''[[Megacyllene robiniae]]'' larvae carve tunnels into the trunk of the tree and make it more prone to being knocked down by the wind.

In many European countries, it is the source of the renowned [[monofloral honey|acacia honey]]. Flowering starts after 140 [[growing degree day]]s. However, its blooming period is short (about 10 days) and it does not consistently produce a honey crop year after year. Weather conditions can have quite an effect on the amount of nectar collected, as well; in [[Ohio]] for example, good locust honey flow happens in one of five years.<ref>http://www.beeclass.com/DTS/blacklocust.htm</ref>\n\nIt can be easily propagated from roots, softwood, or hardwood<ref name=\"dirr\" /><ref name=\"usda factsheet\" /> and this allows for easy reproduction of the plant.

With fertilizer prices rising, the importance of black locust as a nitrogen-fixing species is also noteworthy. The mass application of fertilizers in agriculture and forestry is increasingly expensive; therefore nitrogen-fixing tree and shrub species are gaining importance in managed forestry.<ref name=\"fao bl\" />\n\nIt is also planted for firewood because it grows rapidly, is highly resilient in a variety of soils, and it grows back even faster from its stump after harvest by using the existing root system.<ref name=\"OSU managing your woodlot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.forestry.ok.gov/Websites/forestry/Images/Managing%20Your%20Woodlot%20for%20Firewood.pdf|title=OSU: Managing Your Woodlot for Firewood}}</ref> (see [[coppicing]])\n\nIn Europe, it is often planted along streets and in parks, especially in large cities, because it tolerates pollution well.\n\n==== Cultivars ====\nSeveral cultivars exist but 'Frisia' seems to be one of the most planted ones.\n*'Decaisneana' has been considered a cultivar but is more accurately a hybrid (''R. psudeoacacia'' x ''R. viscosa'').

Common names include '''beaked willow''', '''long-beaked willow''', '''gray willow''', and '''Bebb's willow'''.\n\n[[File:Salix bebbiana (5027584564).jpg|thumb|left|Leaf underside]]\nThis plant is typically a large, fast-growing, multiple-stemmed [[shrub]] or small, shrubby [[tree]] capable of forming dense, colonial thickets. It can be found in loose, saturated soils such as that on riverbanks, lakesides, [[swamp]]s, [[marsh]]es, and [[bog]]s. It is capable of tolerating heavy [[clay]] and rocky soils, making it highly adaptable and durable. It is a dominant species in many marshland areas in its native range.\n\n[[Leaf|Leaves]] are alternately arranged, simple, and ovate in shape, widest near the midrib and narrowing to a tapering base and pointed tip. The leaf edges are generally entire, though sometimes finely serrated. The leaves are dull blue-green in color and smooth in texture when mature; new leaves are coated in downy hairs. The leaves are up to 5 in long and 1.5 in wide. Like other willows, this plant is [[Plant sexuality|dioecious]], with male and female plants producing small, dangling [[catkin]]s. Female flowers yield spherical seeds covered in long, threadlike fibers that help them [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] on the wind. The plant also spreads via [[vegetative reproduction]], sprouting from the base of the stem or from segments of root, and by [[layering]], allowing the plant to form colonies of [[cloning|clones]].<ref name=fs>[http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/salbeb/all.html US Forest Service Fire Ecology]</ref>\n\nThis is the most important species of [[diamond willow]], a type of willow which produces fine, colorful [[wood]] used for [[woodcarving|carving]].<ref name=fs/> The twigs and branches are used by [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native Americans]] for [[basket weaving]] and [[arrow|arrowmaking]].<ref name=fs/>\n\nMany parts of the plant are consumed by animals, especially [[Cattle|domestic cattle]], which find the foliage a palatable [[forage]].<ref name=fs/> \n\nThis species readily [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridizes]] with several other species of willow.<ref>[http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&taxon_id=242445657 Flora of North America]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n==External links==\n[[File:S bebbinia.jpg|thumb|left|Trunk of large tree growing at the far south of its range]]\n\n*[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=SABE2 USDA Plants Profile for ''Salix bebbiana'' (Bebb willow)]\n*[http://herbaria4.herb.berkeley.edu/eflora_display.php?tid=42708 Jepson Manual eFlora (TJM2) treatment of ''Salix bebbiana'']\n*[http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/cgi/img_query?query_src=photos_index&where-taxon=Salix+bebbiana UC Photos gallery: ''Salix bebbiana'']\n{{commons category|position=left}}\n\n\n[[Category:Salix|bebbiana]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Northwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of Western Canada]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Southwestern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Great Lakes region (North America)]]\n[[Category:Flora of Eastern Canada]]\n[[Category:Flora of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Flora of Alaska]]\n[[Category:Flora of California]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1895]]",

The needles are in bundles of two, occasionally three, yellow-green to mid green, fairly stout, and 4\u20137&nbsp;cm long.The pollen is released early compared to other pines in the area to minimize hybridization. The cones are very short-stalked (almost sessile), ovoid, pale pinkish to yellowish buff, and 4\u20139&nbsp;cm long; each scale bears a stout, sharp spine 4\u201310&nbsp;mm long. Sapling trees can bear cones in a little as 5 years.\n[[File:Pinus-pungens-04.JPG|thumb|left|200px]]\nThis pine prefers dry conditions and is mostly found on rocky slopes, preferring higher elevations, from 300\u20131760 m altitude. It commonly grows as single scattered trees or small groves, not in large forests like most other pines, and needs periodic disturbances for seedling establishment.\n\n==In culture==\n''Pinus pungens'' is the '''Lonesome Pine''' of the 1908 novel ''[[The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (novel)|The Trail of the Lonesome Pine]]'' by [[John Fox, Jr.|John Fox]], and popularised in the [[Laurel and Hardy]] film ''Way out West'':\n:''On the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia''\n:''On the Trail of the Lonesome Pine''\nSeveral \"Lonesome Pine\" hiking trails have been [[waymarking|waymarked]] in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] and elsewhere in the Appalachians.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{IUCN2006|assessor=Conifer Specialist Group|year=1998|id=42406|title=Pinus pungens|downloaded=12 May 2006}}\n*Farjon, A. & Frankis, M.

Locally called simply \"yew\", this species is also referred to as American yew or ground-hemlock.\n\nMost of its range is well north of the [[Ohio River]]. It is, however, found as a rare ice age [[relict]] in some coves of the Appalachian Mountains. The southernmost colonies are known from [[Ashe County, North Carolina|Ashe]] and [[Watauga County, North Carolina|Watauga]] Counties in [[North Carolina]].<ref name=Oakley2000 />\n\nIt is usually a sprawling [[shrub]], rarely exceeding 2.5 m tall. It sometimes forms strong upright central leaders, but these cannot be formed from spreading branches, only from the original leader of the seedling plant.  The shrub has thin scaly brown [[bark]]. The [[leaf|leaves]] ([[needle (botany)|needles]]) are lanceolate, flat, dark green, {{convert|1|\u2013|2.5|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=in}} long and {{convert|1|-|2.4|mm|in|abbr=in}} broad,<ref name=\"FNA\">{{eFloras|1|233501254|Taxus canadensis|family=Taxaceae |first=Matthew |last=H. Hils}}</ref> arranged in two flat rows either side of the branch.\n\nThe [[conifer cone|seed cones]] are highly modified, each cone containing a single [[seed]] partly surrounded by a modified scale which develops into a soft, bright red [[Berry (botany)|berry]]-like structure called an [[aril]], open at the end. The seeds are eaten by [[Thrush (bird)|thrushes]], [[waxwing]]s and other [[bird]]s, which disperse the hard seeds undamaged in their droppings. The male cones are globose, 3&nbsp;mm diameter. It is a [[Plant sexuality|monoecious]] plant \u2013 one of the few in the genus.\n\n== Uses and traditions ==\nAll parts of Canadian yew, save the aril, are toxic; it is, however, thought to be of lower toxicity than ''T. baccata''.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nTribes in its native range used small quantities of yew leaf tea topically or internally for a variety of ailments \u2013 notably [[rheumatism]]. Tribes are also been said to have used yew twigs in steam baths to help alleviate [[rheumatism]]. Again, the plant is quite toxic and modern [[Herbalism|herbalists]] prefer safer, more effective herbs.\n\n''Taxus canadensis'' is also being harvested in northern [[Ontario]], [[Qu\u00e9bec]] and [[Atlantic Canada]] as the plant is a source of the class of poisonous chemicals known as [[taxane]]s, which have been a focus for [[cancer]] research.<ref name=MNR /> ''T. canadensis'' is much more abundant than the near-threatened ''[[Taxus brevifolia]]'' (Pacific Yew), and the \"greens\" (new growth) can be [[Sustainable yield|harvested sustainably]] every five years, instead of stripping the bark and killing the plant.\n\nThe most abundant taxane in ''T. canadensis'' is 9-dihydro-13-acetylbaccatin III, which can be effectively converted to [[10-deacetylbaccatin III]], used in the production of [[paclitaxel]].<ref name=Niko2000 /> Two additional taxanes have been identified from ''T. canadensis'', including 7\u03b2,10\u03b2,13\u03b1-triacetoxy-5\u03b1-(3'-dimethylamino-3'-phenylpropanoyl)oxy-2\u03b1-hydroxy-2(3\u219220)abeotaxa-4(20),11-dien-9-one and 2\u03b1,10\u03b2-diacetoxy-9\u03b1-hydroxy-5\u03b1-(3'-dimethylamino-3'-phenylpropanoyl)oxy-3,11-cyclotax-4(20)-en-13-one.<ref name=Shi2006 />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|\nrefs=\n*<ref name=IUCN>{{IUCN | id = 42547| taxon = Taxus canadensis| assessor = Thomas, P.| assessment_year = 2012| version = 2013.1| accessdate = 2013-09-09}}</ref>\n*<ref name=MNR>{{cite web |title=Harvesting Canada Yew \u2013 Information for Landowners |url=http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/Forests/2ColumnSubPage/STEL02_166360.html |publisher=Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources |accessdate=2013-09-09}}</ref>\n*<ref name=Niko2000>{{cite journal |author1=Nikolakakis, A |author2=Caron, G |author3=Cherestes, A |author4=Sauriol, F |author5=Mamer, O |author6=Zamir, LO |title=''Taxus canadensis'' abundant taxane: Conversion to paclitaxel and rearrangements |journal=[[Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry|Bioorg.

It grows faster than many North American hardwoods, often twice the annual growth rate of [[American beech]] and many [[birch]] species. Total life expectancy is around 200 years, with flowering and seeding generally occurring between 15 and 100 years. Occasionally, seed production may start as early as 8 years.\n\nThe crown is domed, the branches spreading, often pendulous. The [[bark]] is gray to light brown, with narrow, well defined fissures. The [[root]]s are large, deep, and spreading. The [[twig]]s are smooth, reddish-green, becoming light gray in their second year, finally dark brown or brownish gray, marked with dark wart-like excrescences. The winter buds are stout, ovate-acute, smooth, deep red, with two bud scales visible.\n\nThe [[leaves]] are [[simple leaf|simple]], [[alternate leaf|alternately]] arranged, [[ovate]] to [[cordate]], asymmetrical, unequal at the base (the side nearest the branch the largest), {{convert|10|\u2013|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} (can grow up to {{convert|25|cm|in|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}) long and broad, with a long, slender petiole, a coarsely serrated margin and an acuminate apex. They open from the bud conduplicate, pale green, downy; when full grown are dark green, smooth, shining above, paler beneath, with tufts of rusty brown hairs in the axils of the primary veins; the small [[stipule]]s fall soon after leaf opening. The fall color is yellow-green to yellow. Both the twigs and leaves contain [[mucilaginous]] sap.\n\nThe [[flower]]s are small, fragrant, yellowish-white, {{convert|10|\u2013|14|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=in}} in diameter, arranged in drooping, [[cymose]] clusters of 6\u201320 with a whitish-green leaf-like [[bract]] attached for half its length at the base of the cyme.

The distribution and description above treat the species in its narrow sense; taken in the broad sense, including plants with the leaves white below with dense tomentum (velvety hairs), the distribution extends southwards to [[Florida]], and in [[Mexico]] west to [[Sinaloa]] and south to [[Oaxaca]].\n\n== Ecology ==\nAmerican basswood is dominant in the [[sugar maple\u2013basswood forest association]], which is most common in western [[Wisconsin]] and central [[Minnesota]], but occurs as far east as [[New England]] and southern [[Quebec]] in places that have [[mesic habitat|mesic]] soil with relatively high [[soil pH|pH]]. It also has minor occurrence in many other forest cover types.\n\nIts flowers provide abundant nectar for insects. The seeds are eaten by [[chipmunk]]s, [[mice]], and [[squirrel]]s. [[Rabbit]]s and [[vole]]s eat the bark, sometimes girdling young trees. The leaves serve as food for [[caterpillar]]s of various [[Lepidoptera]] (see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on Tilia|Lepidoptera which feed on ''Tilia'']]). The [[Bucculatricidae|ribbed cocoon maker]] species ''[[Bucculatrix improvisa]]'' has not been found on other plants.\n\nThis species is particularly susceptible to adult [[Japanese beetle]]s (an [[invasive species]] in North America) that feed on its leaves.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=USDA |title=Managing the Japanese Beetle:A Homeowner\u2019s Handbook |url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/plant_health/content/printable_version/JB3-07.indd.pdf}}</ref>\n\n== Cultivation and uses ==\n[[File:Tilia americana sections.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Sections of ''Tilia americana'' from ''[[The American Woods]]'']]\nThe American basswood can be propagated by cuttings and grafting as well as by seed.  The plants grow rapidly in a rich soil, but are subject to the attacks of many insect enemies.\n\nThe American basswood is known for being one of the most difficult native North American trees to propagate from seed, as they not only have a low viability rate (approximately 30% of all seeds are viable), but quickly develop an extremely hard seed coating that may delay germination for up to two years. If planting them, it is recommended to gather the seeds in early autumn and sow them before they dry out and form a coating. This will then allow germination to occur immediately. Overall, seeds are not a major part of the tree's reproductive strategy and it instead mostly spreads by self-coppicing. All juvenile basswoods [[coppice]] extremely readily, and even old trees will often sprout from the stump if cut.\n\nThe American basswood is recommended as an ornamental tree when the mass of foliage or a deep shade is desired; no native tree surpasses it in this respect. It is often planted on the windward side of an orchard as a protection to young and delicate trees.<ref name=Keeler /> It is cultivated at least as far north as [[Juneau, Alaska]].<ref>Juneau: [http://www.silverbowinn.com/downtown_tree_guide%20final%2006.pdf Downtown Juneau Tree Guide] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818004459/http://www.silverbowinn.com/downtown_tree_guide%20final%2006.pdf |date=August 18, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe foliage and flowers are both edible, though many prefer only to eat the tender young leaves. It is a beneficial species for attracting pollinators as well. Bees produce excellent honey with a mildly spicy flavor from its blossoms.\n\n[[Cultivar]]s include 'Nova', 'Duros' (with an upright crown), the pyramidal 'Frontyard' and the conic-crowned 'Redmond'.\n\n=== Wood ===\n[[File:Natural Basswood Cat Statuette.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|basswood carving]]\nThe wood is pale brown, sometimes nearly white or faintly tinged with red; light, soft with fine close grain; clear of knots but does not split easily. It is low in strength and has a poor steam-bending classification. It can take stains and polish without difficulty and it planes, glues, screws and nails well.<ref>{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Terry |date=2006 |title=Wood Identification & Use \u2013 Revised & Expanded |page=254}}</ref> It is sold generally under the name basswood, but is sometimes confounded with tulip-wood and then called white-wood, and is largely used in the manufacture of wooden-ware, wagon boxes and furniture. It has a [[density]] of 0.4525. The wood is considered odorless. This makes it valuable in the manufacture of wooden-ware, cheap furniture, bodies of carriages; it is also especially adapted for wood-carving. The inner bark is very tough and fibrous, used in the past for making ropes.<ref name=Keeler />\n\nIt is a common wood for use in the production of solid body electric guitars, where it is considered an analogue for aspen and poplar, because it is light, strong and resonant, though it is usually used for guitars that will be painted an opaque color, because its lack of notable grain makes it an unattractive candidate for transparent finish. Linden wood rots easily and old trees have many cavities that serve as nesting places for birds.\n\n=== Medicinal uses ===\nAlthough ''[[Tilia cordata]]'' is believed to be stronger, ''T. americana'' is also used medicinally. The dried flowers are mildly sweet and sticky, and the fruit is somewhat sweet and mucilaginous. Linden tea has a pleasing taste, due to the aromatic volatile oil found in the flowers. The flowers, leaves, wood, and charcoal (obtained from the wood) are used for medicinal purposes. Active ingredients in the linden flowers include [[flavonoid]]s (which act as [[antioxidant]]s), volatile oils, and mucilaginous constituents (which soothe and reduce inflammation). The plant also contains [[tannin]]s that can act as an [[astringent]].<ref name=bradley>{{citation |editor-first=Bradley |editor-last=P |encyclopedia=British Herbal Compendium |volume=I |place=Dorset (Great Britain |publisher=British Herbal Medicine Association |date=1992 |pages=142\u2013144}}</ref>\n\nLinden flowers are used in colds, cough, fever, infections, inflammation, high blood pressure, headache (particularly migraine), as a diuretic (increases urine production), antispasmodic (reduces smooth muscle spasm along the digestive tract), and sedative. The flowers were added to baths to quell hysteria, and steeped as a tea to relieve anxiety-related indigestion, irregular heartbeat, and vomiting. The leaves are used to promote sweating to reduce fevers. The wood is used for liver and gallbladder disorders and cellulitis (inflammation of the skin and surrounding soft tissue). That wood burned to charcoal is ingested to treat intestinal disorders and used topically to treat edema or infection, such as cellulitis or ulcers of the lower leg.<ref name=bradley /><ref name=\"mice\"/>\n\nSeveral animal studies showed that the extract of ''T. americana'' increased sleeping time with 50 minutes (similar to the effects of [[diazepam]]) and decreased movement, which indicates sedative effects.<ref name=\"mice\">{{Cite journal|last=Aguirre-Hern\u00e1ndez|first=E.|last2=Mart\u00ednez|first2=A.

''L. nigrinus'', which is native to the Pacific Northwest, naturally preys on the hemlock wooly adelgid. The particular site near Lansing was chosen because its hemlocks are only lightly infested with the woolly adelgid, and there are enough trees to sustain a long-term study. The site will be left untreated with pesticides for 10 years to study how well the ''L. nigrinus'' beetles become established; if the experiment proves successful, researchers expect the population will take two to three years to build to levels where they can be readily detected.<ref name=scidaily111909>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091113124302.htm Predator Beetle to Battle Hemlock Pest]</ref>\n\n== Paleoecology ==\nThe mid-[[Holocene]] decline of hemlock populations is a much-studied phenomenon.<ref name=Oswald>{{cite journal|last=Oswald|first=W.

The eastern hemlock increased again after the major decline, but did not recover its former place as a dominant species.\n\n== Exceptional trees ==\nDue to its being a long-lived tree, several very large or otherwise impressive trees exist along the east coast of North America. One organization, the [[Eastern Native Tree Society]] (ENTS), has been particularly active in discovering and measuring these trees. In the southern Appalachians, many individuals reach {{convert|45|m}} tall, and one tree has been measured in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to {{convert|52.8|m|ftin}} tall, though this tree is now dead from hemlock woolly adelgid; the tallest now surviving, the \"Noland Mountain tree\", is {{convert|51.8|m|ftin}} tall.<ref name=gd /> Altogether, ENTS has confirmed four trees to heights of {{convert|51|m}} or more by climb and tape drop. In the Northeast, the tallest accurately measured tree is {{convert|44|m}}. This tree, named the Seneca hemlock, grows in Cook Forest State Park, PA. Above 43\u00b0N latitude, the maximum height of the species is less, under {{convert|39|m}}. In New England, ENTS has measured hemlocks to {{convert|42|m}}, although trees above 39&nbsp;m are extremely rare in New England. By 44\u00b0N, the maximum height is probably not more than {{convert|35|m}}.\nDiameters of mature hemlocks range from {{convert|0.75|\u2013|1.8|m|ftin}}, with trees over {{convert|1.6|m|ftin}} diameter being very rare. In New England, the maximum diameter is {{convert|1.4|m|ftin}}.\n\nTrunk volume is the third dimension to receive attention by ENTS. Many eastern hemlocks have been modeled to over 30&nbsp;m\u00b3 trunk volume, and the largest has been calculated to be 44.8 m\u00b3,<ref name=gd>Gymnosperm Database: [http://www.conifers.org/pi/Tsuga_canadensis.php ''Tsuga canadensis'']</ref> making it the largest natural evergreen conifer in the eastern United States. The center of maximum size development for the species is the southern Appalachians, especially the Great Smoky Mountains.\n\n== Cultivation ==\n''Tsuga canadensis'' has long been a popular tree in cultivation. The tree's preference for partial shade and tolerance of full shade allows it to be planted in areas where other conifers would not easily grow. In addition, its very fine-textured foliage that droops to the ground, its pyramidal growth habit and its ability to withstand hard pruning make it a desirable [[ornamental plant|ornamental tree]]. In cultivation, it prefers sites that are slightly acidic to neutral with nutrient-rich and moist but well-drained soil. It is most often used as a specimen, for a screen, or in small group plantings, though it can also be trained as a dense formal hedge. It should not be used on roadsides where salt is used in winter, as its foliage is sensitive to salt spray. It is also poorly adapted as a windbreak tree, as wind exposure causes dieback in winter. It has several drawbacks, such as a fairly low tolerance of urban stress, intolerance for very wet or very dry soils, and susceptibility to attack by the hemlock woolly adelgid, though this is treatable.<ref name=UConn /> Its tendency to shed needles rapidly after being cut down renders it unsuitable as a [[Christmas tree]].\n\nIt was introduced to British gardens in 1736.<ref name=afm>Mitchell, A. F. (1974). ''A Field Guide to the Trees of Britain and Northern Europe''. Collins ISBN 0-00-212035-6</ref> In the [[UK]], it is encountered frequently in gardens both large and small, as well as some parks, and is most common in the eastern areas of the country. It is sometimes employed as a [[hedge (barrier)|hedge]], but is considered inferior for this usage compared to ''[[Tsuga heterophylla]]'' (western hemlock); it is not well adapted to the UK climate and as a consequence often has a poorly developed, forked and sinuous trunk there.<ref name=afm /><ref name=afm2>Mitchell, A.

The American elm is an extremely hardy tree that can withstand winter temperatures as low as \u221242 \u00b0[[Celsius|C]] (\u221244 \u00b0[[Fahrenheit|F]]). Trees in areas unaffected by [[Dutch elm disease]] can live for several hundred years. A prime example of the species was the Sauble Elm,<ref>'Lord of the Elms', [http://web.archive.org/web/20110711013315/http://www.flyingsquirrels.com/sauble_elm/ web.archive.org/web/20110711013315/http://www.flyingsquirrels.com/sauble_elm/]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmitsburg.net/nfs/articles/re/2008/elms.htm|title=Of Elms and Orioles|publisher=Emmitsburg News-Journal: The New Forest Society|accessdate=December 15, 2014}}</ref> which grew beside the banks of the [[Sauble River (Ontario)|Sauble River]] in [[Ontario]], Canada, to a height of 43&nbsp;m (140&nbsp;ft), with a [[diameter at breast height|d.b.h]] of 196&nbsp;cm (6.43&nbsp;ft) before succumbing to Dutch elm disease;  when it was felled in 1968, a tree-ring count established that it had germinated in 1701. \n\nFor over 80 years, ''U. americana'' has been identified as a [[tetraploid]], i.e. having double the usual number of chromosomes, making it unique within the genus. However, a study published in 2011 by the [[Agricultural Research Service]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] revealed that about 20% of wild American elms are [[diploid]], and may even constitute another species. Moreover, several triploid trees known only in cultivation, such as [[Ulmus americana 'Jefferson'|'Jefferson']], are possessed of a high degree of resistance to [[Dutch elm disease]] which ravaged American elms in the 20th century. This suggests that the diploid parent trees, which have markedly smaller cells than the tetraploid, may too be highly resistant to the disease.<ref name=Whittemore>Whittemore, A. & Olsen, R. (2011).

No subspecies or varieties are currently recognized within the species.\n\n==Description==\n\nThe American elm is a [[deciduous]] [[hermaphroditic]] [[tree]] which, before the introduction of Dutch elm disease, commonly grew to > 30&nbsp;m (100&nbsp;ft) tall with a trunk > 1.2&nbsp;m (4&nbsp;ft) [[diameter at breast height|d.b.h]] supporting a high, spreading umbrella-like canopy. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, 7&ndash;20&nbsp;cm long, with double-serrate margins and an oblique base. The [[perfect flower]]s are small, purple-brown and, being wind-pollinated, [[apetalous]]. The flowers are also [[protogynous]], the female parts maturing before the male, thus reducing, but not eliminating, self-fertilization,<ref name=\"Hans\">{{cite journal|last=Hans|first=A.

The [[fruit]] is a flat [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] 2&nbsp;cm long by 1.5&nbsp;cm broad, with a circular papery wing surrounding the single 4\u20135&nbsp;mm [[seed]]. As in the closely related [[Ulmus laevis|European White Elm ''Ulmus laevis'']], the flowers and seeds are borne on 1&ndash;3&nbsp;cm long stems.

However, the condition is far less serious, and afflicted trees should recover the following year.\n\n===Dutch elm disease===\n{{Main article|Dutch elm disease}}\nDutch elm disease (DED) is a [[fungus|fungal]] [[disease]] which has ravaged the American elm, causing catastrophic die-offs in cities across the range. It has been estimated that only approximately 1 in 100,000 American elm trees is DED-tolerant, most known survivors simply having escaped exposure to the disease.<ref name=\"DEDresistance\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jul96/elms0796.htm|title=New American Elms Restore Stately Trees|publisher=Agricultural Research Service, United States Department of Agriculture|date=July 1996|accessdate=December 18, 2014}}</ref> However, in some areas still not populated by Dutch elm disease, the American elm continues to thrive, notably in [[Florida]], [[Alberta]] and [[British Columbia]].\n\nThe American elm is particularly susceptible to disease because the period of infection often coincides with the period, approximately 30 days, of rapid terminal growth when new springwood vessels are fully functional. Spores introduced outside of this period remain largely static within the [[xylem]] and are thus relatively ineffective.<ref name=Smalley>{{cite journal|last=Smalley|first=E. G.|year=1963|title=Seasonal Fluctuations in Susceptibility of Young Elm Seedlings to Dutch Elm Disease|journal=Phytopathology|volume=53|issue=7|pages= 846\u2013853}}</ref>\n\nThe American elm's biology in some ways has helped to spare it from obliteration by the Dutch elm disease, in contrast to what happened to the [[American chestnut]] with the [[chestnut blight]]. The elm's seeds are largely wind-dispersed, and the tree grows quickly and begins bearing seeds at a young age. It grows well along roads or railroad tracks, and in abandoned lots and other disturbed areas, where it is highly tolerant of most stress factors. Elms have been able to survive and to reproduce in areas where the disease had eliminated old trees, although most of these young elms eventually succumb to the disease at a relatively young age. There is some reason to hope that these elms will preserve the genetic diversity of the original population, and that they eventually will hybridize with DED-resistant varieties that have been developed or that occur naturally. After 20 years of research, American scientists first developed DED-resistant strains of elms in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"DEDresistance\" />\n\nFungicidal injections can be administered to valuable American elms, to prevent infection. Such injections generally are effective as a preventive measure for up to three years when performed before any symptoms have appeared, but may be ineffective once the disease is evident.\n\n==Cultivation==\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, American elm was a common street and park tree owing to its tolerance of urban conditions, rapid growth, and graceful form. This however led to extreme overplanting of the species, especially to form living archways over streets, which ultimately produced an unhealthy [[monoculture]] of elms that had no resistance to disease and pests.<ref name=\"Stennes\">{{cite journal| last=Stennes | first=Mark | year=2003 | title=Good News for the American Elm | journal=Shade Tree Advocate | volume=5 | issue=4 | page=6 |accessdate=December 19, 2014}}</ref> These trees' rapid growth and longevity, leading to great size within decades, also favored its horticultural use before the advent of Dutch elm disease.<ref Name=Werthner/> Ohio botanist William B. Werthner, discussing the contrast between open-grown and forest-grown American elms, noted that:  \n<blockquote>\nIn the open, with an abundance of air and light, the main trunk divides into several leading branches which leave the trunk at a sharp angle and continue to grow upward, gradually diverging, dividing and subdividing into long, flexible branchlets whose ends, at last, float lightly in the air, giving the tree a round, somewhat flattened top of beautifully regular proportions and characteristically fine twiggery.<ref name=Werthner />\n</blockquote>\n\nIt is this distinctive growth form that is so valued in the open-grown American elms of street plantings, lawns, and parks; along most narrower streets, elms planted on opposite sides arch and blend together into a leafy canopy over the pavement. However, elms can assume many different sizes and forms depending on the location and climate zone, and the classic vase-like shape is far from the norm in naturally occurring (as opposed to cultivated) specimens.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"px\" heights=\"px\">\nFile:NIE 1905 Elm.jpg|Early photos of New England American elms, showing growth patterns, ''The New International Encyclop\u00e6dia'' (1905).\nFile:Lafayette Street, Salem, MA.jpg|Lafayette Street, Salem, MA.: 'high-tunnel effect' of ''U. americana'' avenues once common in New England.\nFile:American Elm, Western Massachusetts - September 2016.jpg|Surviving American elm \"street tree\" in western Massachusetts (2016).\nFile:PSM V78 D424 An old cambridge landmark.png|''Ulmus americana'' as campus elm: Cambridge, Massachusetts\nFile:Massachusetts American Elm 1 - May 2012.jpg|American elm, Massachusetts (2012).

The [[bark]] is reddish-brown, very rough on old stems. The branchlets are red at first, then green, finally dark brown tinged with red. The winter [[bud]]s are coated with rusty [[tomentum (anatomy)|tomentum]]. The flower buds ovate, 1&nbsp;cm long, much larger than the axillary buds.

The flowers are borne in flat-topped cymes 10&nbsp;cm in diameter in mid to late spring. The [[fruit]] is a [[drupe]] 1&nbsp;cm long, dark blue-black with glaucous bloom, hangs until winter, becomes edible after being frosted, then eaten by birds; the stone is flat and even, broadly oval. Wherever it lives, black haw prefers sunny [[woodland]] with well-drained soil and adequate water.<ref name=missouriplants/><ref name=encyclopedia/><ref name=Keeler/><ref name=Castleman/>\n\n==Uses==\nIt has both value in the pleasure garden, providing good fall color and early winter provender for birds, and medicinal properties.\n\nIt has [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridized]] with ''[[Viburnum lentago]]'' in cultivation to give the garden hybrid [[Viburnum \u00d7 jackii|''Viburnum'' \u00d7 ''jackii'']].\n\nThe [[wood]] is brown tinged with red; heavy, hard, close-grained with a density of 0.8332.<ref name=Keeler/>\n\n===Medicinal uses===\nFor centuries, black haw has been used for medical purposes, mainly for [[gynecology|gynecological]] conditions. The bark is the part of the plant used in treatments.<ref name=encyclopedia/>\n\nThe active components include [[scopoletin]], [[aesculetin]], [[salicin]], [[1-methyl-2,3 clibutyl hemimellitate]], and [[viburnin]]. [[Tannin]] is another chemical component of black haw.<ref name=encyclopedia/>\n\n[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] used a [[decoction]] of black haw to treat gynecological conditions, including menstrual cramps, aiding recovery after [[childbirth]], and in treating the effects of menopause.<ref name=Castleman/> As a folk remedy, black haw has been used to treat menstrual pain, and [[morning sickness]]. Due to its antispasmodic properties, the plant may also be of use in treating cramps of the digestive tract or the bile ducts.<ref name=encyclopedia/>\n\nBlack haw's primary use was to prevent [[miscarriage]]s.<ref name=encyclopedia/> [[Slavery in the United States|American slaveholders]] also used the plant to prevent [[abortion]]s. [[Slave]]s were a valuable asset, and their owner also owned their offspring, so ensuring that female slaves gave birth was of paramount importance. In defiance, some slave women would attempt to use [[cotton]] seeds to cause a miscarriage. The slaveowners would therefore force pregnant slaves to drink an infusion of black haw to prevent that.<ref name=Castleman/> Incorrect - they used the bark from the root of the cotton plant to induce abortion.\n\nThe primary use of black haw today is to prevent menstrual cramps. The salicin in black haw may also be of use in pain relief.<ref name=Castleman/>\n\n===Safety issues===\nLike many other plants, including many food plants and those used as culinary herbs, black haw contains [[salicin]], a chemical relative of [[aspirin]]. Those who are [[allergy|allergic]] to that substance should not use black haw.<ref name=encyclopedia/> In addition, due to the connection between aspirin and [[Reye syndrome]], young people or people afflicted with a [[virus|viral disease]] should not use black haw.\n\nThe chemicals in black haw do relax the uterus and therefore probably prevent miscarriage; however, the salicin may be [[Teratology|teratogenic]]. Consequently, pregnant women should not use black haw in the first two trimesters.<ref name=Castleman/> Furthermore, anyone using herbs for medical reasons should only use them under the supervision of a qualified medical professional.\n\nBlack haw is not on the \"generally recognized as safe list\" of the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).<ref name=FDA>{{cite web|title=SUBSTANCES GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS SAFE|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|work=Code of Federal Regulations - Title 21, Volume 6|date=2006-04-01|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=582&showFR=1|accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{commonscat|Viburnum prunifolium|position=left}}\n\n\n\n[[Category:Viburnum|prunifolium]]\n[[Category:Flora of the North-Central United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Northeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Trees of the Southeastern United States]]\n[[Category:Plants described in 1753]]\n[[Category:Plants used in traditional Native American medicine]]",

Long recognized for its size, the Webster Sycamore was the largest living American sycamore tree in West Virginia until its [[felling]] in 2010. The tree stood approximately {{convert|4.5|mi|km}} east of [[Webster Springs, West Virginia|Webster Springs]] in [[Webster County, West Virginia|Webster County]], in a moist flood plain along the banks of the Back Fork Elk River, a tributary stream of the [[Elk River (West Virginia)|Elk River]].\n\nThe Webster Sycamore reached a [[tree height measurement]] of {{convert|112|ft|m}}, a [[tree crown measurement]] of {{convert|90|ft|m}}, and a circumference of {{convert|25.75|ft|m}} at [[diameter at breast height|breast height]]. In 1955, the [[American Forests|American Forests Association]] declared the tree the largest of its species in the United States. It only held the title for three weeks, before the association identified a larger American sycamore in [[Maryland]]. Despite losing its national title, the sycamore remained the largest American sycamore in West Virginia. Following a 1963 survey of large trees in West Virginia, the Webster Sycamore was named the second-largest tree after a [[white oak]] (''Quercus alba'') in [[Randolph County, West Virginia|Randolph County]].\n\nThe land upon which the Webster Sycamore was located was owned by the Pardee and Curtin Lumber Company, which spared the tree during its [[lumber]] operations in the area during the 1950s. [[West Virginia University]] biologist W.&nbsp;H. Gillespie averred that the tree stood as \"a memorial of the original virgin forest\". The Pardee and Curtin Lumber Company preserved the land surrounding the tree as a park, known as Big Sycamore Park. During the annual events Webster Wildwater Weekend in April and the Webster County Nature Weekend in May, hiking excursions were led to the Webster Sycamore.\n\nOn September 3, 2007, a malicious fire was set in the base of the Webster Sycamore's trunk. The tree survived the blaze, but suffered irreparable damage. The [[West Virginia Division of Forestry]] performed a safety and risk assessment of the tree, and determined that structural mitigation was not feasible, and that the Webster Sycamore was to be \"considered an extreme hazard\". In January 2008, a 17-year-old suspect from [[Bergoo, West Virginia|Bergoo]] was formally charged with a [[felony]] count of [[arson]] for setting fire to the tree. Following the fire, experts recommended that the Webster Sycamore be felled or fenced off as a safety measure. According to the Division of Forestry, the tree was finally brought down during the summer of 2010. At the time of its death, the tree was estimated to be over 500 years old.\n\n== Geography and setting ==\n[[File:Cumberlandplateaumap.png|upright|thumb|right|A map illustrating the [[Allegheny Mountains|Allegheny Mountain Range]] in relation to the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and [[Cumberland Mountains|Cumberland Mountain Range]] of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]|alt=A map illustrating the Allegheny Plateau and the Allegheny and Cumberland mountain ranges of the Appalachian Mountains]]\nPrior to the arrival of [[European American]] [[settler]]s and [[Exploration|explorers]], the [[Allegheny Mountains|Allegheny Mountain Range]] of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] was overlaid with [[old-growth forest]]s consisting predominantly of [[deciduous]] [[hardwood]] trees, which were characterized by individual trees of enormous size and girth.<ref name = \"Lewis1\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1998|p=18.}}</ref><ref name = \"Abramson1\">{{Harvnb|Abramson|Haskell|2006|p=81.}}</ref> The [[Platanus occidentalis|American sycamore]] (''Platanus occidentalis'') was one of the species of trees that proliferated throughout these old-growth forests.<ref name = \"Lewis1\"/> American sycamores can grow at least {{convert|100|ft|m}} in [[Tree height measurement|height]] and the species is distributed throughout the [[Eastern United States]].<ref name = \"WVDC1\">{{cite press release |author=  |title=Sycamore: A Hardy and Popular Shade Tree | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-268431528.html |location=[[Charleston, West Virginia]] |publisher=[[West Virginia Department of Commerce]] |date=September 30, 2011 |accessdate=October 5, 2015 | via=[[HighBeam Research]] | subscription=yes}}</ref><ref name = \"Core1\">{{Harvnb|Core|1950|p=62.}}</ref> It usually thrives in moist soils along streams, especially in sandy [[loam]] soils.<ref name = \"WVDC1\"/><ref name = \"Core1\"/><ref name = \"Hicks1\">{{Harvnb|Hicks|1998|p=166.}}</ref> American sycamores are a dominant species in [[Upland and lowland (freshwater ecology)|bottomland]] and [[Riparian forest|riparian]] forests.<ref name = \"Abramson2\">{{Harvnb|Abramson|Haskell|2006|p=63.}}</ref> The species is present throughout every county in [[West Virginia]], and is most abundant along the state's streams.<ref name = \"WVDC1\"/><ref name = \"Core1\"/>\n\nFormerly West Virginia's largest American sycamore, the Webster Sycamore (alternatively known as the Webster Springs Sycamore and the Big Sycamore Tree) was located in a moist flood plain along the banks of the [[Back Fork Elk River]], a tributary stream of the [[Elk River (West Virginia)|Elk River]], in [[Webster County, West Virginia|Webster County]].<ref name = \"TCG1\">{{cite news| last = | first = | author-link =| title =Authorities investigate arson at landmark tree | newspaper = [[Charleston Gazette-Mail|The Charleston Gazette]] | publication-place = [[Charleston, West Virginia]] | volume = | issue = | date =September 4, 2007 | page = | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13966166.html | accessdate = October 5, 2015|via=[[HighBeam Research]] | subscription=yes}}</ref><ref name = \"CDM3\">{{cite news| last = | first = | author-link =| title =Community briefs | newspaper = [[Charleston Daily Mail]] | publication-place = [[Charleston, West Virginia]] | volume = | issue = | date = April 23, 2008 | page = | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-16306536.html | accessdate = October 5, 2015|subscription=yes| via=[[HighBeam Research]] }}</ref><ref name = \"Gillespie1\">{{Harvnb| Gillespie |1955|p=72.}}</ref> The tree was located approximately {{convert|4.5|mi|km}} east of [[Webster Springs, West Virginia|Webster Springs]].<ref name = \"Hannah1\">{{Harvnb|Hannah|Brashears|2007|p=1.}}</ref><ref name = \"CDM1\">{{cite news| last =Smith  | first = Charlotte Ferrell | author-link =| title =Teen charged with burning historic tree | newspaper = [[Charleston Daily Mail]] | publication-place = [[Charleston, West Virginia]] | volume = | issue = | date = January 15, 2008 | page = | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-15106985.html | accessdate =October 5, 2015|subscription=yes | via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref>\n\n== Dimensions, age, and recognition ==\n\n=== Dimensions and age ===\nVarious measurements were taken of the tree during the latter part of its lifetime; however, measurements of the [[circumference]] differ.

assessed that the tree's \"severe structural weakness\" was not caused by the fire, and instead highlighted the tree's \"size, age, and severity of defects\" as the cause of its instability.<ref name = \"Hannah1\"/> They did, however, assess that the fire may have caused further mortality of the tree's [[cambium]].<ref name = \"Hannah2\">{{Harvnb|Hannah|Brashears|2007|p=2.}}</ref> They used various measurements developed by the [[International Society of Arboriculture]] and the [[United States Forest Service]] to formulate a tree risk assessment.<ref name = \"Hannah1\"/> At the time of their investigation, the tree's diameter at breast height was {{convert|8.42|ft|m}}, with 27% of the trunk consisting of open space.<ref name = \"Hannah1\"/> Hannah and Brashears also found that one-third of the lower trunk and [[root crown]] demonstrated callus formation and no new growth, but instead severe decay and peeling bark.<ref name = \"Hannah1\"/> Hannah and Brashears further determined that structural mitigation was not feasible, and that the Webster Sycamore was to be \"considered an extreme hazard\" and the public should be \"excluded from its striking zone through fencing and signage\".<ref name = \"Hannah1\"/>\n\nThe investigation into the fire was led by the Division of Forestry's chief investigator, Sam Butcher.<ref name = \"CDM1\"/> The investigation lasted four months, and once a suspect had been identified, the case was turned over to the Webster County [[Prosecutor#United States|prosecuting attorney]]'s office.<ref name = \"CDM1\"/> Butcher credited Art Yagel, a Division of Forestry investigator, for bringing the investigation to its conclusion.<ref name = \"CDM1\"/> In January 2008, a 17-year-old suspect from [[Bergoo, West Virginia|Bergoo]] was formally charged with a [[felony]] count of [[arson]] for setting fire to the tree, while a second juvenile was also charged with a [[misdemeanor]] for providing false information to investigators.<ref name = \"CDM1\"/> The suspect was also charged with misdemeanor counts of providing false information to conservation officers, possession of [[marijuana]], and [[Alcohol consumption by youth in the United States|underage consumption of alcohol]].<ref name = \"CDM1\"/> The second juvenile was not involved in the setting of the fire.<ref name = \"CDM1\"/>\n\nFollowing the fire, experts recommended that the Webster Sycamore be [[felling|felled]] or fenced off as a security measure.<ref name = \"CDM1\"/> According to the Division of Forestry, the tree was finally brought down during the summer of 2010.<ref name = \"CDM4\"/>\n\nIn recognition of the tree, the Health Policy Division of the Office of the West Virginia Insurance Commissioner considered the name \"Sycamore Healthcare Exchange\" as one of the naming options for West Virginia's [[health insurance marketplace]] in 2011, following the passage of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care
